One of the initial moves was a push towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and together with a huge column of military vehicles, the Russian military moved into Ukraine north of Kyiv. On 27 February 2022, Russian advanced forces moved into the city of Bucha, making it one of the first outlying areas of Kyiv that Russian forces moved into.[8][9] According to Ukrainian military intelligence, the Russian forces occupying Bucha were the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 35th Combined Arms Army.[10]. In late March, prior to the Russian retreat from Kyiv, Prosecutor General of Ukraine Iryna Venediktova stated that Ukrainian prosecutors had collected evidence of 2,500 suspected cases of war crimes committed by Russia during the invasion and had identified several hundred suspects.[11] Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, also raised concerns about the precise documentation of civilian casualties specifically in regions and cities under heavy fire, highlighting the lack of electricity and reliable communications.[12]. As part of a general retreat of Russian forces north of Kyiv, as well as attacks on Russian formations by the Ukrainian military, Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April.[13]", "summary": "An abominable snowman has broken into the whitehouse", "authors": "fsasgsadfgnwersgfsewfdbfddsfdf", "publish_date": "03-14-2019","split":"test","label":"human"}
