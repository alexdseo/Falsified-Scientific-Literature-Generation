Three of the 21\nand 1 of the 7 convalescent-phase serum samples from persons with increases in antibodies against HCoV-\nOC43 and HCoV-229E, respectively, tested positive by the recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based\nELISA. None of these samples were found to contain a specific antibody in the recombinant SARS-CoV spike\npolypeptide-based Western blot assay.\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by\nSARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has affected 30\ncountries in five continents, with more than 8,000 cases and 750\ndeaths (7\u201311). As for the detection of antibodies against\nSARS-CoV, at the moment, the most widely used methods are\nantibody detection in acute- and convalescent-phase sera by\nindirect immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immu-\nnosorbent assay (ELISA) using cell culture extracts (4, 8, 10).\nHowever, antibody detection by these methods may be less\nreproducible, more difficult to standardize, and more labor-\nintensive than ELISA-based antibody detection tests using re-\ncombinant antigens. Furthermore, producing the infected cell\nlines for coating the ELISA plates and the slides for indirect\nimmunofluorescence requires cultivation of the SARS-CoV,\nfor which biosafety level 3 laboratory facilities are required.\nSuch facilities are not available in most clinical microbiology\nlaboratories.\n\nELISA-based antibody detection tests using recombinant\nantigens are well known to offer higher reproducibility and to\nbe easier to standardize and less labor-intensive than antibody\ndetection by indirect immunofluorescence assay and ELISA\nusing cell culture extract, and they do not require cultivation of\nthe SARS-CoV (1, 2, 14, 18). Recently, we have reported the\n\nuse of recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein ELISA-\nbased antibody tests for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumo-\nnia and the study of the seroprevalence of nonpneumonic\nSARS-CoV infections (15, 16). In addition, others have also\nreported the use of recombinant-protein-based immunoassays\nfor serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumonia (3, 17). However,\nin our studies, we have also shown that false-positive reactions\nwere detected if the recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid\nprotein-based ELISA was used alone for antibody detection\n(15). In this study, using paired serum samples obtained from\npatients with increases in anti-human CoV OC43 (HCoV-\nOC43) or anti-HCoV-229E antibodies, we examined the pos-\nsibility of false-positive results detected by the recombinant\nSARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA. The impor-\ntance of using Western blot assays, with the nucleocapsid pro-\ntein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV, for confirmation was\nalso determined.\n\nPaired serum samples collected from 21 and 7 patients with\nrecent infections by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, respec-\ntively, were retrieved from the serum bank of the Respiratory\nPathogens Research Unit of the Baylor College of Medicine.\nThe paired serum samples were shown to exhibit significant\nincreases in anti-HCoV-OC43 antibodies by immunoassay or\nin anti-HCoV-229E antibodies in microneutralization tests\nsimilar to those described previously (5, 6).\n\nCloning and purification of His6-tagged recombinant nu-\ncleocapsid protein and optimization of the ELISA for detec-\ntion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV were as\n\n* Corresponding author.

ELISA was performed according to\nour previous publications (13, 14) using paired serum samples\n(diluted 1:40) positive for the anti-HCoV-OC43 or anti-\nHCoV-229E antibody. Cloning and purification of the His6-\ntagged recombinant spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV were as\nreported previously (15). Western blot analysis was performed\naccording to our previous publications (14, 15, 18).\n\nThree of the 21 convalescent-phase serum samples, but none\nof the acute-phase serum samples, from patients with recent\nHCoV-OC43 infections were positive by the recombinant\nSARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA for IgG anti-\nbody detection, with optical density at 450 nm (OD450) values\nof 0.337, 0.365, and 0.478 (Fig. 1). Although two serum samples\nproduced very faint bands in the recombinant SARS-CoV nu-\ncleocapsid protein-based Western blot assay, none of them\nwere found to contain the specific antibody by the recombinant\nSARS-CoV spike polypeptide-based Western blot assay (Fig.\n2). There was no relationship between the convalescent-phase\nsample titer or magnitude of the increase in the HCoV-OC43\nELISA and a positive result in the recombinant SARS-CoV\nnucleocapsid protein-based ELISA.\n\nOne of the seven convalescent-phase serum samples, but\nnone of the acute-phase serum samples, from patients with\nrecent HCoV-229E infection was positive by the recombinant\nSARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA for IgG detec-\ntion, with an OD450 value of 0.405 (Fig. 1). Although the serum\nsample produced a very faint band in the recombinant SARS-\nCoV nucleocapsid protein-based Western blot assay, it did not\ncontain the specific antibody according to the recombinant\nSARS-CoV spike polypeptide-based Western blot assay (Fig.\n2). The convalescent-phase serum positive in the recombinant\nSARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA was from the\nserum pair with the greatest rise in titer (eightfold) and had the\nhighest neutralizing-antibody titer.\n\nThe present study showed evidence that cross-reactivity in\n\nthe recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based\nELISA between the SARS-CoV and serum samples positive\nfor antibodies against HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 is possible.\nIn our previous study on the optimization of the SARS-CoV\nrecombinant nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA for IgG anti-\nbody detection, seven of the serum samples obtained from 149\nhealthy blood donors who donated blood in 2000 had OD450s\ngreater than the cutoff value (15). However, none of them were\nfound to contain the specific antibody by both the nucleocapsid\nprotein- and spike polypeptide-based Western blot assays. Fur-\nthermore, when this ELISA was used to screen healthy blood\ndonors who donated blood during the SARS outbreak in Hong\nKong (March to May 2003), nonpneumonic hospitalized pa-\ntients, and asymptomatic health care workers, 33 (4%) of the\n828 serum samples screened were positive for IgG antibodies\n(15). However, only 4 (12%) of the 33 serum samples were\nconfirmed to contain specific SARS-CoV antibodies by both\nnucleocapsid protein- and spike polypeptide-based Western\nblot assays. We speculated that the false-positive results could\nbe due to cross-reactivity between the nucleocapsid protein of\nSARS-CoV and serum samples positive for antibodies against\nHCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, or other undiscovered human\ncoronaviruses, as there is significant homology between the\nnucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV and those of HCoV-OC43\nand HCoV-229E. In the present study, we showed that cross-\nreactivity between the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV and\nserum samples positive for antibodies against HCoV-229E or\nHCoV-OC43 is indeed possible. For about 14% of the HCoV-\nOC43 and HCoV-229E infections detected by serum antibody\nincreases, an antibody increase was detected by the SARS-\nCoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA. The cross-reactive\nserum from an HCoV-229E infection had the highest conva-\nlescent-phase sample titer and greatest increase in titer, but no\nrelationship between the HCoV-OC43 ELISA titers and de-\ntection of antibody in the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-\n\nFIG. 1.

Patients with a positive SARS-\nCoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA result tended to be\nyounger than those with negative tests, but clinical character-\nistics of the illnesses for these two groups were the same (data\nnot shown). For the two HCoV-OC43 antibody-positive serum\nsamples that produced bands when they were tested by the\nnucleocapsid protein-based Western blot assay, the bands were\nstronger than that produced by the HCoV-229E antibody-\npositive serum sample that tested positive by the nucleocapsid\nprotein-based ELISA (Fig. 2). This is probably because the\npercentage of amino acid identity between the nucleocapsid\nprotein of HCoV-OC43 and that of SARS-CoV (33%) is\nhigher than the amino acid identity between the nucleocapsid\nprotein of HCoV-OC43 and that of SARS-CoV (21%). Cross-\nreactivity with HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and other corona-\nviruses remains an important issue for future studies on SARS-\nCoV serology. The use of synthetic peptides, instead of the\nwhole protein, for antibody detection could be a solution to\ncross-reactivity with proteins of other CoVs (13).\n\nThe present study confirmed the high specificity of the re-\ncombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA,\nwith positive results confirmed by Western blot assays using the\nrecombinant nucleocapsid protein and recombinant spike\npolypeptide of SARS-CoV. It is well known that, in the pres-\nence of possible cross-reactions, the positive predictive values\nof serological assays depend on the prevalence of the infection\nin a particular locality at a particular moment. In the present\nstudy the four false-positive results were rectified by consider-\ning Western blot positivity for both the recombinant nucleo-\ncapsid protein and spike polypeptide a genuinely positive re-\n\nsult. As the present ELISA produces a small proportion of\nfalse-positive reactions, all positive results, especially those\nobtained in the context of a low disease prevalence or from\nclinically incompatible cases, need confirmation by Western\nblot analysis using the recombinant nucleocapsid protein and\nspike polypeptide of SARS-CoV. Tan et al. recently demon-\nstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of recombinant nu-\ncleocapsid protein-based Western blot analysis and recombi-\nnant spike protein-based immunofluorescence assay for the\nserodiagnosis of SARS-CoV infection (12). As ELISA is less\nlabor-intensive and tedious to perform than Western blot as-\nsays, Western blot confirmation of positive ELISA results is\nprobably a better choice for routine use in clinical microbiol-\nogy laboratories. The Western blot assay for the spike polypep-\ntide may appear more specific than that for the nucleocapsid\nprotein because of possibly lower antibody titer of and/or avid-\nity for recombinant nonglycosylated protein. Further studies\ncould be performed to see whether Western blot analysis using\nonly the spike polypeptide, instead of using both the nucleo-\ncapsid protein and spike polypeptide, would be able to screen\nout all the false-positive results.\n\nThis study was supported by a Research Grant Council grant (HKU\n7532/03 M), the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious Diseases,\nthe Kai Cheong Tong SARS Research Fund, and NIH grant NO1-AI-\n65298 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

EA (10 or 30mg/kg/day, intragastrically) was administered for 14 consecutive days, and\nactivity, protein, and mRNA levels were determined. Although the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B and CYP2E enzyme activities\nwere decreased significantly, the activities of all other enzymes were unchanged with the 10mg/kg/day EA. In addition, western-\nblot and qRT-PCR results clearly corroborated the above enzyme expressions. On the other hand, while the NAD(P)H:quinone\noxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were\nincreased significantly, CYP1A, 2B, 2C, 2E, and 19 enzyme activities were reduced significantly with 30mg/kg/day EA. In addition,\nCYP2B, 2C6, 2E1, and 19 protein and mRNA levels were substantially decreased by the 30mg/kg/day dose of EA, but the CYP1A\nprotein, and mRNA levels were not changed. CYP3A enzyme activity, protein and mRNA levels were not altered by neither 10 nor\n30mg/kg/day ellagic acid.These results indicate that EA exerts a dose-dependent impact on themetabolismof chemical carcinogens\nand drugs by affecting the enzymes involved in xenobiotics activation/detoxification and antioxidant pathways.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEllagic acid (EA) is one of the important components of\nfruits and vegetables [1] and has been shown to possess\nnumerous anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic properties\ntowards various carcinogens [1\u20137]. Several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to explain the broad antimutagenic and\nanticarcinogenic effects of EA [8\u201313]. One of the mech-\nanisms proposed involves inhibition of cytochrome P450\n(CYP450) enzymes [8]. CYP450 enzymes are widely known\nfor their role in the metabolism of drugs and other foreign\ncompounds. Thus, modulation of this enzyme system can\ninfluence the metabolism of xenobiotics, producing effects\nof pharmacological and toxicological importance. A number\nof naturally occurring flavonoids have been shown to mod-\nulate the CYP450 system by the activation or inhibition of\n\nthese enzymes [14]. Multiple P450 isozymes show different\nsubstrate specificities and affinities toward both endogenous\nand exogenous compounds. Among these P450s, CYP1A, 2B,\n2C, 2E, and 3A subfamilies have received a great deal of\nattention in recent years because of their ability to metabolize\nvarious pharmaceutical and carcinogenic agents [15\u201317]. It\nis well established that CYP1A and CYP2E enzymes are\nmainly involved in carcinogen metabolism while CYP3A,\nCYP2B, and CYP2C enzymes aremainly responsible for drug\nmetabolism.\n\nAromatase represents a crucial enzyme of estrogen\nbiosynthesis, and increased expression of aromatase has\nbeen observed in breast cancer tissue [18]. Flavonoids and\nisoflavones are structurally similar to the endogenous estra-\ndiol and possess both estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities\n\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\n[19]. Previous studies suggest that ellagic acid has potential for\nthe prevention of estrogen-responsive breast cancers [20, 21].\n\nAnother possible mechanism for the broad chemopro-\ntective and antioxidant effects of EA might involve the\ninduction of phase II and antioxidant enzymes. GSTs have a\nconsiderably important role in the detoxification of carcino-\ngens [22]. NQO1 prevents quinine redox cycling and lowers\nlevels of electrophilic quinines [23]. Hence, the inductions of\nGST and NQO1 by flavonoids are possibly associated with\ncancer chemopreventive effects. The present study is, to our\nknowledge, the first study analyzing the effect of EA onNQO1\nactivity, mRNA, and protein levels in rat.\n\nAlthough there are individual studies examining the\neffect of EA on several enzymes, no study has evaluated the\nalteration of so many enzymes simultaneously with different\ndose of EA. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to\nobserve the overall simultaneous changes following in vivo\ntreatment with different dose of EA by investigating changes\nin the activity,mRNA, andprotein levels of specific rat hepatic\nP450s, phase II, and antioxidant enzymes at once.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\n2.1. Chemicals. The following chemicals were purchased\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St Louis, Mis-\nsouri, USA): ellagic acid, acrylamide, aniline, anti-rabbit\nIgG-HRP conjugate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Folin\nphenol reagent, glycerol, glycine, HEPES, \ud835\udefd-NADPH, phe-\nnol, caffeine, TRIS, PMSF, potassium dihydrogen phosphate,\ndipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dodecyl sulfate\n(SDS), and sodium potassium tartrate. Anti-rat CYP1A1,\nCYP2B, CYP2C6, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, and CYP19 antibodies\nwere from Abcam (Abcam PLC, Cambridge, UK). All other\nchemicals and solvents were obtained from commercial\nsources at the highest grade of purity available.\n\n2.2. Animals and Treatment. Healthy maleWistar rats, about\n12 weeks old andweighing 200\u2013250 g, were obtained from the\nUniversity Animal House.They were housed in small cages at\nan ambient temperature of 22\u00b11\u2218C, on a 12 h light/dark cycle,\nand a standard pellet diet and distilled water were available\nwithout restriction. All experimental procedures with the\nanimals were performed under appropriate regimes with vet-\nerinary services within the licensed projects (PAUHADEK-\n2009-007).\n\nAfter being acclimatized for 1 week, the rats were ran-\ndomized and divided into three groups. Ellagic acid was\ngiven intragastrically to two experimental groups (15 rats per\ngroup) in a dose of 10mg/kg/day (T10) and 30mg/kg/day\n(T30) dissolved in DMSO, respectively. Control (15 rats)\nrats only received a vehicle (DMSO). The doses used were\nchosen to be similar to the doses used in previous studies\nin the literature [24\u201326]. The animals were treated for 14\nconsecutive days. At the end of the experimental period\nand following 16 h of fasting, blood was collected by heart\npuncture and the rats were killed; the livers were removed,\nrinsed with cold physiological saline, and stored at \u221280\u2218C\nuntil analyzed.\n\n2.3. Preparations of S1.5, Cytosolic, and Microsomal Frac-\ntion. Tissues were homogenized in a 4 part homogeniza-\ntion solution (1.15% KCl containing 3mM EDTA, 0.5mM\nAPMSF, 0.3mM \ud835\udf00-aminocaproic acid, 0.15mM butylated\nhydroxytoluene, and 0.025% Triton X-100) using a tissue\nhomogenizer with a Teflon pestle at 4\u2218C. Subcellular fractions\n(S1.5, cytosolic, microsomal) of rat tissues were prepared by\nstandard differential centrifugation with calcium aggregation\nas described by [27]. The amount of protein in individual\nfractions was measured using BCA [28] with BSA as the\nstandard.\n\n2.4. Enzyme Assays. Serum aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities\nwere determined with an autoanalyzer using audit di-\nagnostics AST and ALT. The microsomal cytochrome\nP450-dependent aniline 4-hydroxylase (A4H) activities\nof rat microsomes were determined by measuring the\nquantity of p-aminophenol formed, as described by [29].\nAminopyrene N-demethylase (APND), erythromycin N-\ndemethylase (ERND) and caffeine N-demethylase (C3ND),\nn-nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylase (NDMA), ethyl-\nmorphine N-demethylase (EmND), and benzphetamine\nN-demethylase (BPND) activities were determined by\nmeasuring the quantity of formaldehyde formed, according\nto the method of [30] and modified by [31]. Ethoxyresorufin\nO-deethylase (EROD), and methoxyresorufin O-demethyl-\nase (MROD), benzyloxyresorufin O-demethylase (BROD),\npentoxyresorufin O-demethylase (PROD) activities were\nassayed as described by [15]. Dibenzylfluorescein-O-\ndebenzylase (DBFOD) activities were assayed as described\nby [32]. Rat liver NQO1 enzyme activity was determined\naccording to the method of [33]. Glutathione S-transferase\n(GST) activities were assayed as described by [34]. Catalase\n(CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were\ndetermined by [35, 36], respectively.\n\n2.5. Gel Electrophoresis andWestern Blotting. SDS-PAGE and\nwestern blotting were performed as described previously\n[15]. Briefly, 120\ud835\udf07g protein samples were separated on 8.5%\npolyacrylamide gels using the discontinuous buffer system\nof [37]. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose mem-\nbrane by the iBlot dry blotting system (20V, 12min), using\niBlot gel transfer stacks. Following transfer, the membranes\nwere blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20mM\nTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400mM NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween20)\nfor 60min, and incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-rat\nCYP1A1, CYP2B, CYP2C6, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, or CYP19\nantibodies (diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking solution) for 120min\nat room temperature.Themembranes were then washed with\nTBST (3 \u00d7 5min), incubated with the secondary antibody\n(HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a 1 : 5000 or 1 : 10000\ndilution) for 60min and again washed with TBST (3 \u00d7\n5min). Proteins were detected using SuperSignal West Pico\nChemoluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA),\nand bands were visualized and recorded using GelQuant\nImage Analysis Software in a DNR LightBIS Pro Image\nAnalysis System (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems Ltd., Jerusalem,\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\n56 kDa Control\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n56 kDa\n\n56 kDa\n\n10 mg/kg\nEAT\n\n30 mg/kg\nEAT\n\nGAPDH\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nCYP1A protein CYP1A mRNA\n\nRe\nlat\n\niv\ne p\n\nro\nte\n\nin\n co\n\nnc\nen\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(a\n.u\n\n.) \n\nControl\n10 mg/kg EA\n30 mg/kg EA\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: The expression levels of CYP1A protein and mRNA in\ncontrol rats and rats treated with EA.

Protein bands were quantified using Scion Image\nVersion Beta 4.0.2 software.\n\n2.6. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR of CYP mRNAs. Total RNA\nwas extracted from 100mg rat livers using TRIzol reagent.\nExtracted RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically at\n260/280 nm, and the integrity was checked using 1% agarose\ngel. For cDNA synthesis, 2.5 \ud835\udf07g of RNAwas incubated at 70\u2218C\nfor 10 minutes with 0.5\ud835\udf07g of oligo (dT). After 5min on ice,\n50U Moloney murine leukemia virus reverses transcriptase,\n1mM dNTPs and 5X reaction buffer were added to the\nprevious mixture and incubated at 42\u2218C for 60min. The\nreaction was stopped by heating the mixture to 70\u2218C for\n10min, and the cDNA was stored at \u221280\u2218C for further use.\n\nqRT-PCR assay was performed by using gene specific\nprimers. The oligosequences used as forward and reverse\n\nTable 1: Blood serumAST andALT enzyme activities in control and\nEA-treated rats.\n\nAST\nChange\nfold\n\nAST\nChange\n\nfoldUnit/min/mg\nprotein\n\nUnit/min/mg\nprotein\n\nControl 1.53 \u00b1 0.12 \u2014 1.33 \u00b1 0.19 \u2014\n10mg/kg EA 1.55 \u00b1 0.16 \u2014 1.38 \u00b1 0.21 \u2014\n30mg/kg EA 1.54 \u00b1 0.21 \u2014 1.34 \u00b1 0.12 \u2014\n\nprimers for rat CYP450 isozymes were based on those\nreported in [38, 39]. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase (GAPDH) and \ud835\udefd-actin were used as a housekeeping\ngene. The PCR amplification was done using Power SYBR\nGreen PCR master mix (Roche Applied Science, Basel,\nSwitzerland) and 500 nmol/L of forward and reverse primers\nfor each gene, for which the final primer concentration\nwas 125 nmol/L each. Quantitative PCR was done using a\nLight Cycler 1.5 Instrument (Roche Applied Science, Basel,\nSwitzerland). The PCR conditions were as follows: DNA\npolymerase activation at 95\u2218C for 15 minutes, followed by 45\ncycles at 95\u2218C for 10 seconds, 54\u201357\u2218C annealing (depending\non the gene) for 5 seconds, and 72\u2218C for 30 seconds. All gene\nanalyses were done at least three times.\n\n2.7. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing the Minitab 13 statistical software package (Minitab,\nInc., State College, PA, USA). All results were expressed\nas means including their Standard Error of Means (SEMs).\nComparison between groups was performed using Student\u2019s\nt-test, and \ud835\udc43 < 0.05 was selected as the level required\nfor statistical significance. Statistical comparisons between\nthree groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). When F ratios were significant (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05),\none-way ANOVA was followed by Tukey\u2019s Post hoc test for\ncomparisons of multiple group means.\n\n3. Results\n\nControl and treated rats showed no significant differences in\nfood consumption or body weight, (data not shown) after\nintragastric delivery of the EA to the animals at two different\ndoses (T10 and T30).\n\nAs shown in Table 1, blood serumAST and ALT activities\nwere not changed when compared to the control rats. As\npresented in Table 2, hepatic 1A1-associated EROD and 1A2-\nassociatedMRODorC3NDactivities were decreased 11% and\n13% or 40% in T30 treated rats, respectively, when compared\nto controls.\n\nThe effect of the EA onCYP2B-associated BPND, EmND,\nBROD, and PROD activities is presented in Table 2. EA\ntreatment at T10 or T30 for 14 consecutive days caused a\nstatistically significant (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05) 13%, 10%, 15%, and 10% or\n55%, 38%, 23%, and 30% decrease in these activities in the\nliver, respectively.\n\nCYP2E-associated A4H and NDMA activities in control\nand EA-treated rats are given in Table 2.

Similarly, EA treatment at T10 reduced 28%\nand 26% with respect to the control.\n\nThe effect of the EA on CYP2C6-associated APND,\nCYP3A-associated ERND, and CYP19-associated DBFOD\nactivity is presented in Table 2. EA treatment at T30 caused\na statistically significant 55%, 28%, and 24% decrease in\nCYP2C6, CYP3A, and CYP19 activities in the liver, respec-\ntively.\n\nGSTs activities in control and EA-treated rats are given\nin Table 2. GST activities towards three different substrates,\nnamely, CDNB, DCNB, and EA were increased 49%, 42%,\nand 33% (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05) in the T30 treated group. Furthermore,\ntreatment of rats with T30 dose caused 194%, 64%, and 114%\nincreases in NQO1, CAT, and GPX activities, respectively,\nwhen compared to the control values (Table 2).\n\nThe activation of catalytic activities was generally consis-\ntent with the protein levels of related CYP isoforms in rat liver\nmicrosomes that were prepared from control and EA-treated\nrats (Figures 1\u20136). The densitometric scanning of western\nblot results showed that hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A were not\nsignificantly changed in the T10 or T30 treated rats relative to\nthe control animals (Figures 1 and 5).\n\nThe densitometric scanning of western blot results\nshowed that hepatic CYP2B protein level was decreased 51%\nand 38% as a result of two different doses of EA treatments.\nMoreover, T10 and T30 treatments caused a 53% and 32%\nreduction of the CYP2E protein level (Figures 2 and 4).\nAlthough CYP2C and CYP19 protein levels were reduced\nwith T30 treatment, it was not at a significant level (Figures 3\nand 6).\n\nThe effect of EA on themRNA levels of CYP isozymeswas\nalso determined throughout in this study.The relative CYP1A\nand CYP3A mRNA levels were not changed significantly\n\nin the EA-treated rats as compared to the control animals\n(Figures 1 and 5). CYP2E level was decreased significantly\n79% and 31% in T10 and T30 treated rats, respectively\n(Figure 4). In addition, CYP2B level was reduced 76% and\n39% as a result of two different doses of EA-treated rats\nrelative to the controls (Figure 2). CYP2C level was decreased\n49% significantly in EA-treated rats at T30, respectively\n(Figure 3). Similar to the changes at protein level, CYP19\nmRNA was decreased but not significantly (Figure 6).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAlterations in the cellular metabolism of xenobiotics are\nthe most important mechanisms that play a vital role dur-\ning chemical-induced carcinogenicity. Therefore, the use of\ndietary antioxidants is an important preventive method to\nminimize the pathological and toxic effects associated with\nxenobiotics [8, 10, 14]. In this context, this study is carried out\nto examine the dose-dependent effects of EA on specific P450\nforms and also on selected phase II and antioxidant enzymes\nin rat liver.\n\nPlasma AST and ALT, alone or in combination, are\nprimarily recommended for the assessment of hepatocellular\ninjury in rodents and nonrodents in nonclinical studies.They\nare sensitive markers for drug-induced liver damage, and\nthe elevated activities of these marker enzymes in plasma\nare indicative of cellular leakage and loss of the functional\nintegrity of cell membranes in the liver [40]. Treatment with\nEA at different doses (T10 and T30) caused no changes in the\nactivities of these marker enzymes in plasma when compared\nwith the control group. Therefore, EA, at these doses, can be\nused in preventive or complementary medicine with safety\nprecautions and within the scope of the methods employed\nin public health.\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 5\n\n56 kDa Control\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n56 kDa\n\n56 kDa\n\n10 mg/kg\nEAT\n\n30 mg/kg\nEAT\n\nGAPDH\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nCYP2B protein CYP2B mRNA\n\nRe\nlat\n\niv\ne p\n\nro\nte\n\nin\n co\n\nnc\nen\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(a\n.u\n\n.) \n\nControl\n10 mg/kg EA\n30 mg/kg EA\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: The expression levels of CYP2B protein and mRNA in\ncontrol rats and rats treated with EA.

This CYP is the\nprimary P450 involved in the conversion of outstanding\ncarcinogens to the electrophilic metabolites and is known\nto be induced by its substrates such as benzopyrene. In\nthis study, CYP1A1/CYP1A2-associated enzyme activities,\nEROD, MROD, and C3ND were all decreased as a result\nof T30 treatment, consistent with the previous findings\nof [41]. Although EA treatment resulted in a significant\nreduction in CYP1A1/CYP1A2-associated enzyme activities,\nhepatic CYP1A1 protein and mRNA levels were found not\nto be changed with EA treatments. EA inhibited CYP1A\nenzymes directly, without an alteration of its gene and protein\nexpression, and the in vivo effect depends to a great degree\non the concentration of this compound in rat liver.

Consistent with\nprotein levels, administration of the EA had also decreased\nthe CYP2E1 mRNA level. Since the regulation of CYP2E1\nexpression is complex, involving transcriptional, posttran-\nscriptional, and posttranslational events with polymorphism\nplaying a role [45], the observed mRNA decrease resulting\nfrom EA treatment could be either transcriptional or post-\ntranscriptional, which remains to be elucidated. Hence, no\nmatter what the mechanism is, EA administration might\ndecrease the carcinogenesis by inhibiting CYP2E1 and reduce\nreactive oxygen species by affecting the metabolic pathways\nof alcohol.\n\nCytochrome 2B, 2C, and 3A enzymes participate in a\nwide array of metabolism of drugs.

Similarly, EA-treatment caused inhibitory effect\nin CYP3A-associated ERND activity in rat liver microsomes.\nAs previously shown with CYP3A or CYP2C activities [46,\n47], EA, which is an antioxidant found in large quantities\nin pomegranate juice, displayed a probably nonmechanism-\nbased inhibitory effect for CYP3A andCYP2C activities in rat\nliver microsomes. Thus, drug interactions are fairly likely to\noccur if EA supplements are taken simultaneouslywith drugs.\n\nThe aromatase enzyme, which converts androgen to\nestrogen, plays a key role particularly in breast carcinogenesis.\nCYP19-associated enzyme activities, DBFOD,were decreased\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 7\n\n58 kDa Control\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n58 kDa\n\n58 kDa\n\n10 mg/kg\nEAT\n\n30 mg/kg\nEAT\n\nGAPDH\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nCYP19 protein CYP19 mRNA\n\nRe\nlat\n\niv\ne p\n\nro\nte\n\nin\n co\n\nnc\nen\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(a\n.u\n\n.) \n\nControl\n10 mg/kg EA\n30 mg/kg EA\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6: The expression levels of CYP19 protein and mRNA in\ncontrol rats and rats treated with EA.

In addition, CYP19 protein and\nmRNA levels were reduced with T30 to a lesser extent than\nthe activities. Therefore, the observed inhibition resulting\nfrom EA treatment could be neither transcriptional nor\ntranslational and remains to be elucidated. Taken together\nwith the results of previous reports [20] and the results of the\ncurrent study, it may be suggested that EA intake may be a\nviable strategy for the chemoprevention of breast cancer.\n\nSome of the anticancer effects of dietary polyphenols are\nrelated, at least partly, to their indirect antioxidant activities\n[48\u201351]. For example, the enhancement of GPX, catalase,\nNQO1, GSTs, and/or phase II enzyme activities by polyphe-\nnols could help the detoxification of carcinogenic agents.\nHence, the induction of these enzyme activities by flavonoids\nis possibly associated with cancer chemopreventive effects.\nIn this study, EA treatment caused an increase in GSTs,\n\nNQO1, GPX, and CAT activities in rat liver microsomes.\nSimilarly, the induction of liver GSTs, NQO1, and CAT\nenzyme activities by flavonoids such as genistein, daidzein,\nflavone, rutin, quercitrin, myricetin, and kaempferol was\nreported in recent studies [52\u201356]. These observations may\nbe of importance in view of the potential use of EA both as\npotent anticancer agents as well as chemopreventive agents.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this study, the different doses of EA did not produce the\nsame effects. While the lower dose of EA (10mg/kg/day) was\nnot effective because its concentration might not have been\nenough to reach to the site of action and quench all free\nradicals generated, the higher dose of EA (30mg/kg/day)\nwas good enough to be effective. In conclusion, the dose-\ndependent suppression of CYP1A, CYP2E, and CYP19 and\nthe induction of GSTs, NQO1, GPX, and CAT enzymes\nsuggest anticancer as well as chemopreventive roles for EA\nwhile reductions in CYP2B, 2C, and 3A explain potential\ndrug interactions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Scientific and Technological\nResearch Council of Turkey [109R012] and Pamukkale Uni-\nversity [2010FBE081].

However, the role of STIM1 in the progression and metastasis of colorectal\ncancer (CRC) has not been addressed. In this study, we confirmed increased expression of STIM1 in highly invasive CRC cell lines.\nEnhanced expression of STIM1 promoted CRC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas silencing of STIM1 with small interfering\nRNA resulted in reduced metastasis. Ectopic expression of STIM1 in CRC cells induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),\nwhereas silencing of STIM1 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, STIM1 expression was markedly higher in CRC tissues than in\nadjacent noncancerous tissues. STIM1 overexpression correlated with poor differentiation and higher tumor node metastasis stage.\nCRC patients with positive STIM1 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative STIM1 expression. Moreover, STIM1\nwas found to be a direct target of miR-185, a microRNA (miRNA) that has not previously been reported to be involved in EMT, in\nboth CRC tissues and cell lines. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that STIM1 promotes metastasis and is\nassociated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. In addition, we show that expression of STIM1 is\nregulated by a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism mediated by a new EMT-related miRNA. This novel miR-185\u2013STIM1 axis\npromotes CRC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies.\n\nOncogene (2015) 34, 4808\u20134820; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.404; published online 22 December 2014\n\nINTRODUCTION\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent carcinomas\nthroughout the world, with an estimated one million new cases\nand half a million mortalities each year.1,2 Metastasis, one of the\nsix initial cancer hallmarks,3 is a major cause of CRC-associated\nmortality.4 More than one-third of patients with CRC will ultimately\ndevelop metastatic disease;5 however, little is known about the\nexact molecular mechanisms underlying CRC metastasis.6 Under-\nstanding the key factors in these processes is crucial to the\ndevelopment of novel anticancer therapies.\nIn most types of cell, the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ is a\n\ncritical regulator that mediates various cellular processes.7 In non-\nexcitable cells, the store-operated calcium influx (SOCE) is the\nmajor mechanism of Ca2+ entry.8,9 Recent studies have identified\ntwo important molecules responsible for SOCE activation: STIM1\n(stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai1.8 When Ca2+ in the\nendoplasmic reticulum is depleted, STIM1 serves as a Ca2+ sensor\nand aggregates into multiple punctae that translocate within close\nproximity of the plasma membranes.10 Orai1, an essential pore-\nforming component of the SOCE channel, translocates to these\nSTIM1-containing structures during store depletion and open\nstomediate Ca2+ entry.11\u201313 Recently, STIM1 has been reported to\nhave an important role in various pathophysiological conditions,\n\nsuch as the immune response,11,14 cardiovascular disease,15,16\n\nsexual dysfunction17 and pulmonary disease.18 STIM1 was also\nfound to be involved in cancer and was initially thought to work\nas a tumor suppressor,19 although subsequent data indicate an\nopposite function.20 More recently, Orai1 and STIM1 were shown\nto be essential for the migration of breast tumor cells.21 Another\nstudy found that STIM1 has an important role in the growth,\nmigration and angiogenesis of cervical cancer.22 These studies\nsuggest that STIM1 might have a critical role in cancer.\nEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a morphogenetic\n\nprocess in which cells lose their epithelial characteristics such as\ncell polarity and cell\u2013cell contact, and gain mesenchymal proper-\nties such as increased motility. EMT also endows cells with invasive\nproperties, induces stem cell properties and prevents apoptosis\nand senescence. Morphologic evidence of EMT has been found at\nthe invasive front of human tumors.23 EMT is viewed as an\nessential early step and a critical process during tumor\nmetastasis.24\u201327 Notably, several recent studies suggest that EMT\ninitiated by Oct4 or Snail1 in breast cancer may be associated with\nSTIM1-directed Ca2 influx.21,23,28\u201330 These studies strongly suggest\nthat STIM1 may promote cancer metastasis by regulating EMT.\nMicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that posttran-\n\nscriptionally regulate protein expression.31 Several studies have\n\nState Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.\nCorrespondence: Professor Y Shi or Professor D Fan, State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, The Fourth Military Medical University, 127\nChang Le West Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, People's Republic of China.\nE-mail: shiyquan@fmmu.edu.cn or daimingfan@fmmu.edu.cn\n1These authors contributed equally to this work.\nReceived 15 November 2013; revised 21 October 2014; accepted 4 November 2014; published online 22 December 2014\n\nOncogene (2015) 34, 4808\u20134820\n\nwww.nature.com/onc\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2014.404\nmailto:shiyquan@fmmu.edu.cn\nmailto:daimingfan@fmmu.edu.cn) (DF)\nhttp://www.nature.com/onc\n\n\nshown that miRNAs have an important role in cancer metastasis.32\n\nRecently, some studies have highlighted the importance of\nmiRNAs in the regulation of EMT.33,34 As both miRNAs and STIM1\nmay have important roles in EMT process, we are interested in\n\nwhether STIM1 expression is regulated by certain miRNAs in\ncancer.

Three different siRNAs targeting STIM1 were\ntested, and the two that most effectively knocked down STIM1\nexpression (SW620-STIM1si1 and SW620-STIM1si2) were selected\nfor subsequent studies. SW480 cells were infected with\nrecombinant lentivirus expressing STIM1 (LV-STIM1) or a control\nlentivirus (LV-NC) and stable clones were established\n(SW480-STIM1c1, SW480-STIM1c2 and SW480-NC, respectively;\nFigure 1b).

During the EMT\nprocess, differentiated polarized epithelial cells undergo profound\nmorphogenetic changes, typified by the dissolution of cell\u2013cell\njunctions and loss of apicobasolateral polarity, resulting in the\nformation of migratory mesenchymal cells with invasive proper-\nties. Moreover, during this process the expression of epithelial\nmarkers (such as E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin) is downregulated,\nwhereas the expression of mesenchymal markers (such as\nvimentin and fibronectin) is upregulated.38,39\n\nBy comparing the morphology of the cell models described\nabove under a light microscope, we observed that ectopic\nexpression of STIM1 in SW480 cells induced the conversion of\npolarized epithelial cells to spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like\nmesenchymal cells with the loss of cell\u2013cell adhesion, whereas\nknockdown of STIM1 in SW620 cells resulted in a tighter\norganization of cells in colonies and an epithelioid morphology\n(Figure 3a).\nNext, we assessed the expression of EMT markers in these cell\n\nmodels. Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription\u2013\nPCR (qRT\u2013PCR) analysis showed a marked decrease in the\nexpression of vimentin and fibronectin and a significant increase\nin the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin in SW620-STIM1si1\nand SW620-STIM1si1 cells, compared with control cells. Conver-\nsely, a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and\nan increase in the expression of vimentin and fibronectin were\nobserved in SW480-STIM1c1 and SW480-STIM1c1 cells, compared\nwith control cells (Figures 3b and c). These changes in E-cadherin\nand vimentin expression were confirmed by an immunofluores-\ncent assay (Figure 3d). These results suggest that STIM1 is critical\nfor the acquisition of EMT characteristics and may contribute to\nthe EMT-derived invasive phenotype in CRC cells.\n\nSTIM1 is significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues and\nindicates poor prognosis\nTo explore the potential role of STIM1 in determining the clinical\noutcome of CRC, we assessed STIM1 expression in a tissue\nmicroarray of 90 CRC patients. The results of immunohistochem-\nical staining showed that STIM1 was localized to both the\ncytoplasm and membranes. Positive STIM1 expression was\ndetected in 63 of 90 (71.1%) primary CRC samples compared\nwith only 19 of 90 (21.1%) adjacent non-tumor tissues. These\nresults were confirmed by scoring the staining intensity across the\nsection (Figures 4A1\u20133). These findings indicated that STIM1 was\nsignificantly overexpressed in human CRC tissues. To investigate\nthe correlation between STIM1 overexpression and CRC\nmetastasis, we compared STIM1 expression in 10 pairs of LN\nmetastasis-positive (LN-positive group) and LN metastasis-\nnegative (LN-negative group) primary CRC specimens. Real-time\nPCR analysis showed that STIM1 mRNA levels were much higher in\nthe LN-positive group than in the LN-negative group (Figure 4C).\nFurthermore, Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that patients with\npositive STIM1 expression had shorter overall survival than those\nwho were negative for STIM1 expression (Figure 4D). To\ninvestigate whether STIM1 expression is associated with the\nprogression of CRC, we investigated the expression of STIM1 in an\nadditional 40 fresh CRC tissues by qRT\u2013PCR (Figure 4B) and\ncompared the results with the clinicopathologic characteristics of\nthe patients. The results showed that overexpression of STIM1 did\nnot correlate with age, gender or tumor size (P40.05), but was\nsignificantly associated with TNM stage and LN status (Po0.01;\nTable 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the expression\nlevel of STIM1 positively correlated with the progression of CRC\nand that STIM1 overexpression is indicative of poor prognoses of\nhuman CRC patients following curative resection.\n\nThe expression of miR-185 inversely correlates with the expression\nof STIM1 in CRC cells and is associated with the progression of CRC\nThe above results indicated that STIM1 overexpression might have\na critical role in CRC. However, there have been few studies on the\nregulation of STIM1 expression in cancer. miRNAs were recently\nfound to have an important role in tumor progression through\ntheir function as posttranscriptional regulators. We hypothesized\nthat posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs may represent one\nof the upstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression. To\ntest this idea, we used several web-based target analysis tools\n(TargetScan, miRanda, RNAhybrid, pictar and DIANAmT) to identify\nmiRNAs that potentially target STIM1. As a result, miR-185 was\nidentified as a potential regulator of STIM1 expression (Figure 5a).\nThis was consistent with the results of our previous miRNA\nmicroarray analysis, which identified miR-185 as the most\nsignificantly downregulated miRNA in SW620 cells compared with\nSW480 cells.36 Therefore, miR-185 was selected for further study.\nWe examined endogenous miR-185 expression levels in four\n\nhuman CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT29 and LOVO) and in a\nnormal human intestinal epithelial cell line by qRT\u2013PCR. The\nexpression levels of miR-185 were significantly decreased in\nSW620 and LOVO cell lines (highly metastatic cells) compared with\neither poorly metastatic or immortalized cells. miR-185 expression\nnegatively correlated with the metastatic potential of the CRC cells\n(Figure 5b1). Furthermore, the expression of miR-185 and STIM1\nwas inversely correlated (Figure 5b2). To investigate the correla-\ntion of miR-185 with STIM1 expression levels in CRC tissues, we\nused qRT\u2013PCR to measure the expression levels of miR-185 in the\n40 CRC tissues previously described. Our results confirmed that\nthe mRNA level of miR-185 negatively correlated with STIM1\nexpression (Figure 5c2). The correlation of miR-185 expression\nwith clinicopathologic factors was also examined. In contrast to\nSTIM1 expression, low expression levels of miR-185 were\nsignificantly associated with advanced clinical tumor node\n\nTable 1.

These results\nstrongly suggest that miR-185 is one of the upstream molecules\nregulating STIM1 expression in cancer.\n\nmiR-185 represses invasion and regulates EMT in CRC cells\nTo investigate the role that miR-185 has in the migration and\ninvasion of CRC cells, the SW620 cell line was transiently\ntransfected with miR-185 mimics. Successful upregulation of\nmiR-185 expression was confirmed by qRT\u2013PCR (Figure 6a1).\nIncreased miR-185 expression resulted in significant inhibition of\nmigration and invasion in SW620 cells (Figures 6a2 and a3). To\ndetermine whether the loss of miR-185 promotes the migration or\n\ninvasion of CRC cells, miR-185 was silenced in SW480 cells with an\nantisense oligonucleotide inhibitor (Figure 6b1). This inhibition of\nmiR-185 significantly promoted cell migration and invasion\n(Figures 6b2 and b3). These results indicate that miR-185 represses\nthe invasive potential of CRC cells. As STIM1 has been shown to\npromote EMT in CRC cells and miR-185 has been predicted as a\npotential regulator of STIM1, we hypothesized that miR-185 may\nexert an opposite effect on the regulation of EMT in CRC cells. To\ntest this, we compared the morphology of our cell models under a\nlight microscope, and found that upregulating the expression of\nmiR-185 in SW620 cells induced a tighter organization of cells in\ncolonies, whereas downregulating the expression of miR-185 in\nSW480 cells led to a more fibroblast-like mesenchymal cell\nmorphology (Figure 3c).

To\nobtain additional direct evidence that STIM1 expression is\nregulated by miR-185, we analyzed the binding site of miR-185\nin the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of STIM1 and performed a\nluciferase reporter assay. An STIM1 3\u2032-UTR reporter (Luc-STIM1) or\nthe corresponding mutant reporter (Luc-STIM1-mu) was co-\ntransfected with miR-185 mimics or mimic controls into SW620\ncells. As expected, the luciferase activities of the reporter\nconstructs were reduced significantly only when miR-185 mimics\nwere co-transfected with Luc-STIM1 in SW620 cells. No apparent\nchange in luciferase activities was observed in cells transfected\nwith Luc-STIM1-mu or mimic controls (Figure 7a). To confirm\nwhether targeting of the STIM1 3\u2032-UTR by miR-185 was functional,\nSW620 cells transfected with miR-185 mimics and SW480 cells\ntransfected with the miR-185 inhibitor were analyzed by qRT\u2013PCR\nand western blotting. Both mRNA (Figure 7b1) and protein\n(Figure 7b2) levels of STIM1 were markedly upregulated in SW480\ncells transfected with the miR-185 inhibitor, whereas both mRNA\n(Figure 7c1) and protein (Figure 7c2) levels of STIM1 were\neffectively downregulated in SW620 cells transfected with the\nmiR-185 mimic. Further experiments confirmed that the altered\nmiR-185 expression does not affect the expression of STIM2,\nOrai1, Orai2 and Orai3, which may also be involved in SOCE\n\n(Supplementary Figures S2A and B). These results suggest that\nSTIM1 is a direct functional target of miR-185. To further\ncorroborate this hypothesis, we performed a \u2018rescue\u2019 experiment\nby co-transfecting SW620 cells with miR-185 mimics and a\npcDNA3.1 vector carrying an STIM1 expression cassette\n(pcDNA3.1-STIM1) or mutated seed sequences of miR-185 at the\nSTIM1 3\u2032-UTR (STIM1-mu). Western blot analysis demonstrated\nthat co-transfection of SW620 cells with the miR-185 mimic and\nSTIM1-mu restored STIM1 protein expression, whereas co-\ntransfection with pcDNA3.1-STIM1 failed to recover the STIM1\nexpression that was silenced by the miR-185 mimic. Furthermore,\nrestoration of STIM1 expression by the introduction of STIM1-mu\ninto SW620 cells transfected with the miR-185 mimics inhibited\nthe expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and increased the\nexpression of vimentin and fibronectin (Figure 7d). In addition,\nrescuing STIM1 expression in the presence of the miR-185 mimics\nenhanced the invasion and migration potential of SW620 cells\n(Figure 7e). Moreover, to determine the effect of the miR-185\u2013\nSTIM1 axis on SOCE, we examined cellular Ca2+ distribution by\nCa2+ imaging in both SW620 and SW480 cells. After ER Ca2+\n\ndepletion, Ca2+ influx through SOCE into SW620 cells was\nincreased compared with SW480 cells (Supplementary Figures\nS3A and B). We then examined the effect of overexpression of\nmiR-185 and found that SOCE was impaired in SW620\u2013miR-185\nmimic cells (Supplementary Figures S3C and D), whereas\ninhibition of miR-185 in SW480 cells moderately increased\nSOCE (Supplementary Figures S3E and F). Taken together, these\nresults suggest that STIM1 is a potential functional target of\nmiR-185.\nIn summary, our results suggest that STIM1 is a direct functional\n\ntarget of miR-185 and that this novel miR-185/STIM1 axis has an\nimportant role in the regulation of CRC metastasis.\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we demonstrate that STIM1 promotes CRC\nmetastasis. The upregulation of STIM1 in CRC is at least partly\nattributed to posttranscriptional regulation by miR-185, a novel\nEMT-regulating miRNA. Additionally, we provide evidence sup-\nporting the involvement of STIM1 in the regulation of EMT in\ncancer.\nThe influx of Ca2+ is essential for the migration of tumor\n\ncells.40,41 STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, regulates\nCa2+ influx by activating SOCE.11,12 STIM1 has recently been\nproposed to be a critical molecule in the regulation of cancer\nmetastasis,21,22 although the exact role of STIM1 in metastasis\nremains controversial. STIM1 was initially implicated as an\nantimetastasis molecule.19 However, we found that STIM1\npromoted migration and invasive properties in CRC, and that\nincreased expression of STIM1 in CRC was significantly associated\nwith cancer metastasis. In accordance with our study, STIM1 was\nreported to be one of the molecules essential for breast tumor cell\nmigration in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo.21 Similarly, another\nstudy demonstrated that the level of STIM1 was significantly\nassociated with the risk of metastasis in cervical cancer. Moreover,\nepidermal growth factor-stimulated migration in cervical cancer\ncells requires STIM1 expression.22 Our results provide new\nevidence supporting the involvement of STIM1 in the promotion\nof cancer metastasis.\nIt has been reported that expression of constitutively active Ras\n\novercomes the migration-inhibitory function of the Ca2+ influx\ninhibitor and STIM1 siRNA in breast cancer.21 Interestingly,\na previous study has shown that activation of the Ras signaling\npathway leads to activation of the transcriptional regulator,\nSnail1,28 which appears to have a major role in EMT.23,29 These\nstudies strongly suggest that STIM1 might promote cancer\nmetastasis by regulating the EMT. In this study, we demonstrated\nthat knockdown of STIM1 induced the conversion of spindle-\n\nTable 2.

Moreover,\nincreased levels of STIM1 correlated with a high metastatic\npotential of CRC cells. In accordance with our findings, a previous\nstudy also showed that STIM1 was significantly associated with the\nrisk of metastasis in cervical cancer.22 Based on these findings,\nelucidating the mechanism of STIM1 upregulation may contribute\nto the identification of new cancer therapy targets. A recent study\ndemonstrated that the expression of STIM1 is regulated by Wilms\ntumor suppressor 1 and early growth response 1 in six specific\ncancer subtypes.42 Another study reported that STIM1 is regulated\nby androgens in prostate stromal cells. However, these observa-\ntions are not sufficient to explain the mechanism behind the\nupregulation of STIM1 in cancer. A recent study found that\nanother STIM protein, STIM2, inversely control melanoma growth\nand invasion,43 suggesting that STIM proteins, including STIM1\nand STIM2, have critical roles in cancer. Interestingly, these STIM\nproteins may exert different and even opposite functions in\ndifferent kinds of cancers, which imply complex and important\nroles in cancer. Further study on STIM family may provide new\ntargets for cancer therapy.\nmiRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of tumor\n\nmetastasis32 and recent studies have highlighted the importance\nof miRNAs in the regulation of the EMT.33,34 To explore whether\nposttranscriptional regulation by certain miRNAs is one of the\nupstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression, we used\nseveral target prediction algorithms to assay for miRNA binding\nsites in the STIM1 3\u2032-UTR. miRNA-185 was identified by several\nalgorithms. Surprisingly, our previous miRNA microarray analysis\nrevealed that miR-185 was the most significantly downregulated\nmiRNA in SW620 cells (highly metastatic) compared with SW480\ncells (poorly metastatic).36 In this study, we found that miR-185\nexpression inversely correlated with the expression of STIM1 in\nboth CRC cells and tissues, and that transfection with miR-185\nsignificantly downregulated the expression of STIM1. These results\nwere further confirmed by luciferase activity assays. miR-185 was\nrecently found to be an independent prognostic factor in gastric\ncancer44 and hepatocellular carcinoma.45 Moreover, miR-185 can\ninduce cell cycle arrest and repress cell proliferation in non-small-\ncell lung cancer,46 colorectal cancer,47 glioma,48 gastric cancer49\n\nand breast cancer.50 miR-185 has also been reported to be\ninvolved in metastasis in colorectal cancer51 and glioma.48\n\nHowever, the role of miR-185 in the pathophysiological functions\nof STIM1 has not previously been reported.\nThe results presented here show that upregulating the\n\nexpression of miR-185 inhibited migration and invasion and\nreversed the EMT in CRC cells. Our data further indicate that\nSTIM1 is a functional target of miR-185 in CRC. Taken together,\nthese findings provide new insight into the mechanism of the\n\nregulation of STIM1 expression at the posttranscriptional level,\nalthough further studies are required to fully understand the\nmechanism by which the miR-185-STIM1 pathway regulates EMT\nin cancer.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a critical function of\n\nSTIM1 in promoting CRC metastasis. This study also reveals a new\nregulatory mechanism of STIM1 expression by miR-185, an miRNA\nnot previously associated with the EMT process. We believe that\nthe miR-185-STIM1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic\nintervention against cancer metastasis.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture\nThe human CRC cell lines were preserved in our institute and were\nroutinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA),\n100 U/ml penicillin sodium and 100mg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 \u00b0C in\na humidified air atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. Throughout\nthe experiment, cells were used in the logarithmic phase of growth\naccording to the supplier\u2019s instructions.\n\nClinical samples\nSamples from 40 CRC patients (23 males and 17 females) who had\nundergone proctocolectomy with LN dissection for CRC at Xijing Hospital\n(Xi'an, China) between November 2008 and April 2009 were included in\nthe study (Supplementary Table S2). None of the patients received\npreoperative chemotherapy. The resected specimens were histologically\nexamined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The primary tumor samples\nand corresponding non-tumor mucosa were collected from each patient\nimmediately after the surgical process and were snap frozen in liquid\nnitrogen until further use. Total RNA from the frozen tissues was isolated\nwith TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions.\n\nOligonucleotide construction, lentivirus production and construct\ndesign\nAn miR-185 mimic, an inhibitor and a negative control oligonucleotides\nwere purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). Transfection of\noligonucleotides was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. On the basis of the STIM1\nsequence, three short hairpin RNAs were designed using the siRNA Target\nFinder (InvivoGene, San Diego, CA, USA): 5\u2032-GGGAAGACCTCAATTACCA-3\u2032,\n5\u2032-TCTCCACATTTGGATTCTT-5\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGATGATGTAGATCATAA-3\u2032. Lenti-\nviral vectors encoding short haipin RNAs were generated using GV248\nvector (GeneChem Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). Stable transfectants\noverexpressing STIM1 were generated by lentiviral transduction using a\nGV166 vector (GeneChem Co., Ltd). An empty vector was used as the\nnegative control.\nSTIM1-expressing vector with miR-185 binding sites or mutated seed\n\nsequences of miR-185 at STIM1 3\u2032-UTR (STIM1-mu) was purchased from\nOpen Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA) and was subcloned into the\neukaryotic expression vector.\n\nLuciferase assay\nLuc-STIM1 vector.

The aim of this\nstudy was to explore the role of SIRT1 signaling on Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-\ninduced IL-17 and IL-23 production in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). IL-17 and IL-23 pro-\nduction was significantly increased in LPS-treated cells. LPS treatment also led to the upregulation of\nSIRT1 mRNA and protein expression. LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 upregulation was attenuated by pre-\ntreatment with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase\n(ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NF-jB, as well as\nneutralizing antibodies against Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4. Sirtinol treatment (a known SIRT1\ninhibitor) or SIRT1 knockdown by small interfering RNA blocked LPS-stimulated IL-17 and IL-23 expres-\nsion. Further investigation showed that LPS decreased osteoblast markers (i.e., ALP, OPN, and BSP) and\nconcomitantly increased osteoclast markers (i.e., RANKL and M-CSF). This response was attenuated by\ninhibitors of the PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, NF-jB, and SIRT1 pathways. These findings, for the first time, sug-\ngest that human periodontopathogen P. gingivalis LPS is implicated in periodontal disease bone destruc-\ntion and may mediate IL-17 and IL-23 release from hPDLCs. This process is dependent, at least in part, on\nSIRT1-Akt/PI3K-MAPK-NF-jB signaling.\n\n\ufffd 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nPeriodontitis is a chronic destructive inflammatory disease of\nteeth-supporting tissues [i.e., connective tissue of the periodontal\nligament and alveolar bone]. This inflammatory condition is initi-\nated by a complex bacterial biofilm localized in the subgingival\nenvironment, where Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major causative\npathogen [1]. Elevated P. gingivalis levels are present in periodontal\nlesions and are significantly reduced by successful therapy [2]. P.\ngingivalis modulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,\nsuch as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a by gingival epithe-\nlial cells [3,4]. Several reports indicate that specific components of\nP. gingivalis, including fimbriae and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in-\nduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8,\nand TNF-a) in human and murine monocytes and macrophages\nll rights reserved.\n\naxillofacial Tissue Regenera-\neogi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu,\n6; fax: +82 2 960 1457.\n\ncorresponding author.\n[5,6]. In addition, P. gingivalis LPS leads to periodontal tissue\ndestruction and alveolar bone resorption through IL-6 and IL-8 re-\nlease from human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs; [7]), and\nthese inflammatory cytokines play a role in the destruction and\ndisintegration of the extracellular matrix [8]. We previously re-\nported that hPDLCs may play an important role, as these cells pro-\nduce inflammatory cytokines, including receptor activator of\nnuclear factor-jB ligand (RANKL; [9\u201314]), which is related to bone\nmetabolism in periodontal diseases. However, the mechanisms by\nwhich local immune responses against bacterial virulence factors\nresult in the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues remains to\nbe established.\n\nAmong the inflammatory cytokines implicated in inflammatory\ndisease, much interest is focused on two recently identified cyto-\nkines: IL-23 and IL-17. IL-17 (also known as IL-17A), a pro-inflam-\nmatory cytokine that is regulated by IL-23, is crucial for the\ndevelopment of a novel CD4+ T-cell subset called T-helper 17\n(Th17) cells, which promote tissue inflammation in host-defense\nresponses against infection [15]. Enhanced IL-17 expression is\nreported in various inflammation models, including rheumatoid\narthritis, periodontitis, asthma, and organ rejection [16\u201318]. In\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.021\nmailto:eckim@khu.ac.kr\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.021\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\nY.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293 285\naddition, IL-17 may affect osteoclast resorption indirectly through\nosteoblasts, like other pro-inflammatory cytokines [19,20]. IL-17\nlevels in inflamed gingival tissues of periodontitis are higher than\nthose in healthy control tissues [16,21]. Similarly, the amount of\nIL-17 in gingival crevicular fluid samples is significantly higher in\nperiodontitis patients [22,23]. Furthermore, IL-17RA-deficient mice\nhave enhanced periodontal bone destruction following P. gingivalis\ninfection, suggesting a bone-protective role of IL-17 [24]. IL-23, a\nheterodimeric protein that is composed of the IL-12p40 subunit\nand a specific IL-23p19 subunit, is primarily produced by activated\ndendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages [25]. IL-23, in conjunc-\ntion with IL-1, then contributes to the expansion and maintenance of\nTh17 cells that, once activated, release the cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F,\nIL-22, TNF-a, and IL-6, all of which can induce inflammatory\nresponses [26]. Furthermore, high numbers of IL-17- and IL-23-\nexpressing cells are present in the ileum of Crohn\u2019s disease [27],\nactive uveitis of Bechet\u2019s disease [28], lupus nephritis [29], and\ngingival tissue of periodontitis patients [16].\n\nSIRT1 is a prominent member of the NAD+-dependent enzyme\nfamily and affects a variety of cellular functions ranging from gene\nsilencing, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and differentiation to en-\nergy homeostasis [30\u201332]. Several recent studies implicated SIRT1\nin the regulation of inflammatory responses [33,34]. SIRT1 can also\ninhibit nuclear transcription factor-jB (NF-jB), a master transcrip-\ntion factor involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cyto-\nkines, which enhances cell death in response to the inflammatory\ncytokine TNF-a [35]. However, very little is known regarding\nwhether SIRT1 regulates LPS-induced IL-23 or IL-23 axis signaling,\nparticularly in periodontitis bone destruction.\n\nThis study was designed to gain further knowledge on the im-\npact of P. gingivalis LPS on the regulation of IL-17 and IL-23 produc-\ntion, and homeostasis between osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes\nin hPDLCs. We also investigated potential mechanisms involved in\nthis process, including the role of SIRT1.\nTable 1\nReverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers and conditions.\n\nGene Sequence (50\u201330) Size\n(bp)\n\nTm\n(\ufffdC)\n\nIL-17 Forward: CGATGACTCCTGGGAAGACCTC 490 60\nReverse: GTGTGGGCTCCCCAGAGCTCTTA\n\nIL-23 Forward: GCAGATTCCAAGCCTCAGTC 524 60\nReverse: TTCAACATATGCAGGTCCCA\n\nALP Forward: ACGTGGCTAAGAATGTCATC 475 55\nReverse: CTGGTAGGCGATGTCCTTA\n\nOPN Forward: AATGAAAACGAAGAAAGCGAAG 347 55\nReverse: ATCATAGCCATCGTAGCCTTGT\n\nBSP Forward: TGGAGATGACAGTTCAGAAG 333 52\nReverse: GTACTGGTGCCGTTTATGC\n\nOPG Forward: TGCAGTACGTCAAGCAGGAG 575 56\nReverse: TGACCTCTGTGAAAACAGC\n\nRANKL Forward: GCCAGTGGGAGATGTTAG 486 55\nReverse: TTAGCTGCAAGTTTTCCC\n\nM-CSF Forward: ATGACAGACAGGTGGAACTGCCAGTGTAGAGG 437 60\nReverse: TCACACAACTTCAGTAGGTTCAGGTGA TGGGC\n\nSIRT-1 Forward: GCAACATCTTATGATTGGCACA 820 60\nReverse: AAATACCATCCCTTGACCTGAA\n\nb-Actin Forward: CATGGATGATGATATCGCCGCG 371 55\nReverse: ACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTCG\n2.

Antibodies (Abs) against phospho-ERK (p-ERK), ERK, phos-\npho-p38 (p-p38), p38, phospho-JNK (p-JNK), and JNK were pur-\nchased from Cell Signaling. Wortmannin was purchased from\nCalbiochem (San Diego, CA).\n\n2.2. Cell culture\n\nImmortalized hPDLCs, transfected with human telomerase cata-\nlytic component (hTERT), were kindly provided by professor Takashi\nTakata (Hiroshima University, Japan) [37]. Cells were cultured in\na-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and\n100 lg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at\n37 \ufffdC.\n\n2.3. Western blot analysis\n\nCells (1 \ufffd 106) from each set of experiments were harvested\nand washed twice in cold tris-buffered saline. Cells were\nsolubilized in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After 30 min\non ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Proteins\n(20 lg) were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE (10% acrylamide), transferred\nto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with specific Abs\n(diluted 1/1000), followed by incubation with secondary HRP-con-\njugated Ab (1/5000).

Effects of LPS on IL-17, IL-23, and SIRT1 mRNA and protein\nexpression\n\nTo investigate whether LPS could induce IL-17 and IL-23\ncytokines in hPDLCs, cells were stimulated with various LPS\nconcentrations, and cytokine production was measured by reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot-\nting, and ELISA (Fig. 1A\u2013F). IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA and protein\nexpression were upregulated by LPS in a time- and concentra-\ntion-dependent fashion, with cytokine accumulation peaking at\n1 lg/ml 24 h LPS posttreatment (Fig. 1A\u2013D). After 24 h LPS stimu-\nlation, hPDLCs secreted significant amounts of IL-17; a LPS concen-\ntration of 1 lg/ml induced the largest production (Fig. 1E and F).\n\nTo understand the role of SIRT1 in LPS-induced cell signaling\nprocesses, we first assessed the expression of SIRT1 mRNA and pro-\ntein by RT-PCR and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A\u2013D, LPS\ntreatment significantly increased SIRT1 protein and mRNA levels\nin a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a maximal\neffect at 1 lg/ml for 24 h. LPS (1 lg/ml) did not adversely affect cell\nviability (data not shown) and was thus used in subsequent\nexperiments.\n\n3.2. Signaling pathways of LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression\n\nTo determine the signaling pathways involved in the upregula-\ntion of IL-17 and IL-23 expression by LPS in hPDLCs, we examined\nthe activation states of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB. LPS treatment\ninduced phosphorylation of Akt, p38, ERK, and JNK without affect-\ning the total levels of these kinases. In addition, LPS treatment\nincreased the NF-jB p65 nuclear translocation and IjB-a degrada-\ntion in hPDLCs (Fig. 2).\n\nTo further examine the roles of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB in LPS-in-\nduced IL-17 and IL-23, pharmacological inhibitors of signaling\nintermediates were used. Pretreatment with inhibitors of phospha-\ntidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY294002 and wortmannin), p38\n(SB203580), ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), and NF-jB (pyrroli-\ndine dithiocarbamate, PDTC) blocked LPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17,\nand IL-23 expression, and IL-17 secretion in hPDLCs (Fig. 3A\u2013C).\n\nTo determine whether the increased SIRT1 level was associated\nwith LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression, hPDLCs were pre-\ntreated with the pharmacological SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol. After\n1 h sirtinol pretreatment, cells were treated with LPS for 24 h\nand subjected to immunoblot analysis. The data showed that\nLPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17, and IL-23 expression and that IL-17\nsecretion was attenuated by sirtinol pretreatment (Fig. 3A\u2013C).\n\n3.3. Effects of signaling pathway inhibitors on LPS-induced osteogenic\nand osteoclastogenic gene expression\n\nTo investigate the putative mechanism linking IL-17 and IL-23\nto alveolar bone homeostasis, we analyzed the expression pattern\nof osteogenic and osteoclastogenic genes associated with bone-loss\nconditions. As shown in Fig. 4, LPS treatment concomitantly down-\nregulated the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopon-\ntin (OPN), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) mRNA expression, and\nupregulated the expression of nuclear factor j B-ligands (RANKL)\nand macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF), but not\nosteoprotegerin (OPG). Treatment with sirtinol, LY294002 and\nwortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), U0126\n(ERK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and PDTC (NF-jB inhib-\nitor) blocked the effects of LPS on the upregulation of RANKL and\nM-CSF, and downregulation of ALP, OPN, and BSP mRNA expression\n(Fig. 4). The vehicle control was 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\nbecause sirtinol was dissolved in DMSO.\n\n3.4. Functional role of TLR2 and TLR4 on LPS-induced response\n\nSince TLR2 or TLR4 serves as the main mediator of responses to\nLPS, we initially examined whether LPS influenced the expression\nof TLR2 and TLR4 in hPDLCs. Following LPS exposure, TLR2 and\nTRL4 protein levels increased in a time- and concentration-depen-\ndent manner (Fig. 5A and B). To assess the functional involvement\nof TLR2 and TLR4 in LPS-induced cytokine response of hPDLCs, cells\nwere incubated with anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody\n(10 lg/ml) before LPS stimulation. Antibody specificity was\nassessed by incubating with control IgG from non-immunized\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Effects of various signaling pathway inhibitors on P. gingivalis-induced IL-17, IL-23, and SIRT1 expression. Cells were preincubated with (A) medium only or with\nwortmannin (WM; PI3K inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), sirtinol (SIRT1 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor),\nPDTC (NF-kB inhibitor), or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 60 min before stimulation with 1 lg/ml P. gingivalis LPS for 1 h.

In addi-\ntion, treatment of cells with anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies\nblocked LPS-induced SIRT1, IL-17, and IL-23 upregulation, but\nIgG1 and IgG2a did not (Fig. 6A\u2013C). The anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2\nantibodies also attenuated LPS-induced osteogenic and osteoclas-\ntogenic gene mRNA expression (Fig. 6D).\n3.5. Effect of SIRT1 siRNA on LPS-induced responses\n\nTo further confirm the role of SIRT1 in LPS-induced IL-17, IL-23,\nand osteoblastic and osteoclastogenic gene expression, we knocked\ndown SIRT1 with a specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 7A, SIRT1 siRNA\nsuccessfully knocked down SIRT1 expression in hPDLCss and\nblocked LPS-induced IL-17 secretion, expression of the mRNAs\nencoding IL-17 and IL-23, osteoblastic genes (ALP, OPN, BSP), and\nosteoclastogenic genes (RANKL and M-CSF), whereas transfection\nof cells with an equivalent amount of nonspecific siRNA had no\neffect (Fig. 7B\u2013E).\n\nTo elucidate the molecular basis of the responses to SIRT1 inhi-\nbition, we examined the effects of SIRT1 siRNA on LPS-induced Akt,\nMAPK, and NF-jB signaling pathways in hPDLCs. As shown in\nFig. 8, SIRT1 siRNA pretreatment decreased LPS-induced phosphor-\nylation of Akt, p38, ERK, and JNK, and the degradation of IjBa and\nthe nuclear translocation of p65 (NF-jB).\n4. Discussion\n\nPeriodontal disease is triggered by potentially hazardous micro-\norganisms, which induce consequent immune-inflammatory re-\nsponses. IL-17 treatment of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs)\nleads to IL-6 production, and IL-8 and intercellular adhesion mole-\ncule (ICAM)-1 expression [37], which may contribute to local tissue\ninflammation. Furthermore, IL-17 induces RANKL expression via\ninduction of prostaglandin E2 production in osteoblasts and is\nreleased by IL-23 stimulation [38,39]. Moreover, both IL-23 and\nIL-27 inhibit bone marrow cell osteoclastogenesis induced by\nM-CSF/soluble RANKL [40]. Whether the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is in-\nvolved in periodontal bone destruction is unclear, although in-\ncreased IL-17 and IL-23 levels are found in gingival tissue and\ncrevicular fluid of patients with periodontitis [16,21\u201323]. There-\nfore, our study was designed to investigate the association be-\ntween periodontal bone loss and production of IL-23 and IL-17\nby the periodontopathogen P. gingivalis LPS in hPDLCs.\n\nAs primary hPDLCs are heterogeneous cell populations with\nvaried proliferative potential, long-term culture of hPDLCs is apt\nto reduce the number of cells with low proliferative potential, so\nthat their primary phenotype is lost [41]. Consequently, reproduc-\nible results are difficult to obtain and the biology and regenerative\nmechanism of hPDLCs is difficult to clarify by using primary cells\n[42]. Therefore, to address this issue, we used immortalized\nhPDLCs, which retain the features of their original primary cells,\n\n\n\nFig. 6. Effect of blocking TLR2 and TLR4 on LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 production (A\u2013C), SIRT1 expression (A and B), and osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes (D). Cells were\npreincubated with or without TLR2 or TLR4 mAbs or isotype control (IC) abs for 60 min before stimulation with 1 lg/ml P. gingivalis LPS for 24 h. Histogram is densitometric\nquantitation of mRNA or protein expression. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. \ufffdStatistically significant difference compared to the control\ngroup, p < 0.05. #Statistically significant difference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.\n\n290 Y.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293\nviz., hPDLCs [36]. In addition, Kitagawa et al. [36] demonstrated\nthat F-spondin increased the expressions of ALP, OCN, and BSP\nmRNA, and ALP activity in immortalized hPDLCs. Thus, immortal-\nized this cell line is helpful tools for studying the biology and\nregenerative mechanisms of hPDLCs.\n\nLPS is a well-known endotoxin which elicits a variety of inflam-\nmatory responses. In humans, LPS binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2\nreceptor complex, which triggers the signaling cascade for many\ncell types to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide\n[43]. LPS-treated hPDLCs were found to respond to the endotoxin\nby activation of TLR4 and TLR2, promotion of NF-jB subunit p65\ntranslocation to the nucleus and enhanced expression of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines [13,44]. To examine the role of IL-17 and\nIL-23 signaling in the LPS response, we first analyzed IL-17 and\nIL-23 protein and mRNA levels. Our results indicate that LPS\ninduces IL-17 and IL-23 expression and IL-17 secretion in a time-\nand concentration-dependent manner, which is consistent with\nthe previous finding that LPS stimulates pro-inflammatory cyto-\nkines such as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 IL-10, TNF-a, and IL-12 in hPDLCs\n[13,44,45]. Following LPS exposure, parallel to IL-17 and IL-23\nupregulation, we detected increased protein and mRNA levels of\nSIRT1. These results are consistent with our previous study, which\nshowed that SIRT1 mRNA and protein is upregulated by LPS and\nheat stress in dental pulp cells [33].\n\nAkt/PI3K, MAPK, and NF-jB pathways play a pivotal role in\npro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine regulation [18,32\u201334].\nOur results demonstrated that LPS activated Akt/PI3K, p38, JNK,\nERKK, and NF-jB pathways in hPDLCs. Based on the results of a\ncytotoxicity assay, we used optimal inhibitor concentrations of\nPI3K (20 lM LY294002 and 100 nM wortmannin), ERK (20 lM\nPD98059), p38 MAPK (20 lM SB203580), JNK (10 lM SP600125),\nand NF-jB (1 mM PDTC) that elicited inhibitory effects without\ntoxicity. Our results showed that SB203580, PD98058, SP600125,\nwortmannin, LY294002, and PDTC downregulated LPS-induced IL-\n17 and IL-23, which suggests that Akt/PI3K, ERK, p38, JNK, and\nNF-jB mediate LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-23 expression in HDP cells.\nConsistent with our data on hPDLCs, IL-17 produced by activated\nrheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells is com-\npletely or partly blocked in the presence of the PDTC, wortmannin,\nand LY294002 [18].\n\n\n\nFig. 7. Effects of SIRT1 siRNA on P. gingivalis LPS-induced SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels (A and B), osteoblastic and osteoclastic genes (C), and IL-17 and IL-23 production (D\u2013\nF). Cells were transiently transfected with a control vector or SIRT1 siRNA, followed by 24 h LPS treatment. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.\nHistogram is densitometric quantitation of mRNA or protein expression. \ufffdStatistically significant difference compared to the control group, p < 0.05. #Statistically significant\ndifference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.\n\nY.-D. Park et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 284\u2013293 291\nTLR2 and TLR4, transmembrane receptors that transmit the LPS\nsignal to intracellular components in signal transduction path-\nways, play important roles in the immune system [46]. TLR4 is\nassociated with the recognition of Gram-negative bacterial LPS,\nand TLR2 is regarded as the receptor for Gram-positive bacteria\n[47]. Tabeta et al. [48] reported that P. gingivalis LPS stimulates\nhuman gingival fibroblasts to secrete IL-1 and IL-6 via TLR4. In\ncontrast, Zhang et al. [49] found that P. gingivalis LPS could utilize\nboth TLR2 and TLR4 to induce the production of cytokines such as\nTNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in THP-1 cells. In the present study, we ob-\nserved that TLR4 and TLR2 expression increased in hPDLCs exposed\nto P. gingivalis LPS and that neutralizing anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4\nantibodies specifically inhibited P. gingivalis LPS-induced expres-\nsion and secretion of IL-17 and IL-23, as well as Akt/PI3K activation\nand its downstream pathways, including MAPK and NF-jB. These\nresults suggest that TLR2 and TRL4 play important roles in the\ndefense mechanisms of microorganisms by stimulating a wide\nrepertoire of signal transduction pathways that promote inflam-\nmatory processes.\n\nRecent studies implicated SIRT1 in the regulation of inflamma-\ntory responses [32\u201334]. Resveratrol-induced SIRT1 activation or\nadenoviral-mediated SIRT1 overexpression blocks the expression\nand release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to environ-\nmental stress [50,51]. To assess the role of SIRT1 in IL-17 and IL-23\nexpression in hPDLCs, we tested the effects of SIRT1 inhibition and\ngene silencing. In the present study, we showed that downregulat-\ning SIRT1 expression via SIRT1 siRNA or blocking SIRT1 activity via\nsirtinol prevented LPS-mediated induction of IL-17 and IL-23\nexpression and production. This result is consistent with the previ-\nous finding that inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol reduces cytokine\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Effects of SIRT1 siRNA on P. gingivalis LPS-induced Akt, MAPK, and NF-kB\nactivation. Cells were transiently transfected with control vector or SIRT1 siRNA,\nfollowed by 1 h LPS treatment.

Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.\n#Statistically significant difference compared to the LPS-treated group, p < 0.05.\n\n292 Y.-D.

These results suggested that SIRT1 inhibi-\ntion may modulate the inflammatory response to periodontal\npathogens in hPDLCs.\n\nIn the present study, downregulation of SIRT1 expression levels\nby siRNA diminished LPS-stimulated Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB activa-\ntion. This may indicate that SIRT1 plays a modulatory role within\nthe LPS signaling cascade. Reciprocally, we observed inhibitors\nfor Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB blocked LPS-induced SIRT1 mRNA and\nprotein expression. These results suggested that SIRT1 activation\nmay be an important upstream target of Akt, MAPK, and NF-jB\nin the regulation of hPDLCs. Consistent with these findings, we pre-\nviously reported that inhibitors for PI3K, MAPK and NF-jB blocked\nthe mechanical stress-induced SIRT1 mRNA expression in hPDLCs\n[32]. Overall, the above findings suggest that direct functional\ninteraction between SIRT1 and LPS signaling does exist in hPDLCs\nculture models.\n\nPeriodontal inflammation affects the net loss of bone by en-\nhanced resorption and diminished bone formation. hPDLCs have\nosteoblastic properties and express ALP, OPN, and BSP [55].\nMoreover, hPDLCs express RANKL, OPG, and M-CSF [11,14,34],\nwhich contribute to bone metabolism regulation, such as\nosteoclastogenesis. To evaluate hDPLCs differentiation status, we\nanalyzed the mRNA expression of different genes involved in\nosteoblast (ALP, OPN, and BSP) and osteoclast differentiation\n(RANKL, OPG, and M-CSF). Our data demonstrated that LPS down-\nregulated osteoblastic differentiation marker mRNA (ALP, OPN, and\nBSP) and concomitantly upregulated the expression of osteoclast\ndifferentiation markers (RANKL and M-CSF). These results are con-\nsistent with a previous study on the osteoclastic-inducing effects\n[56] and osteoblastic-inhibiting effects of P. gingivalis LPS [57]. In\nthe present study, hPDLCs pretreatment with inhibitors of PI3K,\np38 MAPK, ERK, JNK, NF-jB, anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR2 antibodies,\nsirtinol, and SIRT1 siRNA blocked LPS-induced upregulation of\nosteoclast markers (RANKL and M-CSF) and prevented downregu-\nlation of osteoblast markers (ALP, OPN, and BSP). Furthermore,\nSIRT1 inhibition by sirtinol and SIRT1 siRNA blocked LPS-induced\nactivation of Akt/PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, and NF-jB. These results sug-\ngest that SIRT1, AKt/PI3K, p38, ERK, JNK, and NF-jB, TLR2, and\nTLR4 pathways are involved in these responses. Further studies\nare needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of action of LPS\non SIRT1 signaling.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that\nSIRT1, Akt/PI3K, MAPK, NF-jB, TLR2, and TLR4 signaling pathways\nare involved in regulating the Th17-related molecules IL-17 and IL-\n23, which are stimulated by P. gingivalis LPS treatment in hPDLCs.\nPharmacological modulation of SIRT1 may be a novel therapeutic\napproach for modulating the inflammatory response and bone\ndestruction associated with periodontal disease.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Mid-career Researcher Program\nthrough National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded\nby the (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) (No.\n2009-0078526).\nReferences\n\n[1] Haffajee AD, Socransky SS.

Kreydiy\nThe activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase was shown to be reduced during apoptosis and enhanced during cell\nproliferation. This work investigated whether TNF-a exerts also opposite effects on the Na+/K+ ATPase\nin HepG2 cells and whether these effects are time-dependent. A time response study demonstrated that\nthe activity and protein expression of the ATPase are decreased at 1 h and increased at 4, 6 and 8 h. This\nwork focused on the up-regulatory 4 h-response. TNF-a was shown to exert a stimulatory effect on cJNK\nand NF-jB and an inhibitory effect on caspases which, in the basal state, down-regulate the ATPase. The\ncytokine was found to target the caspases by activating JNK which in turn activates NF-jB. The activated\ntranscription factor inhibits the caspases and frees the ATPase from their inhibitory action leading thus to\nits up-regulation.\n\n\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nTumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine\nwith numerous biological properties ranging from inflammation to\nproliferation, differentiation, and cancer growth. It plays a central\nrole in shock due to sepsis and wasting syndromes due to a variety\nof cancers [1]. It is also involved in different physiological and\npathophysiological conditions [2]. In the liver it was described to\nact as a \u2018\u2018two-edged sword\u201d [3], exerting both apoptotic and anti-\napoptotic effects.\n\nThese antagonistic effects were ascribed to the multiple and\ncomplex signaling pathways activated by the cytokine. Caspases,\nnuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [4],\nproteases, ceramides, and reactive oxygen species, were all found\nto mediate TNF-a action. While activation of NF-jB was found cru-\ncial for cell survival, activation of caspases was deemed essential\nfor the apoptotic process. The role of JNK is however still contro-\nversial promoting both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses [5].\n\nApoptosis was found to be accompanied by changes in the lev-\nels of Na+, K+ , and Cl\ufffd , and a decrease in the activity of the Na+/K+\n\nATPase also known as Na+/K+ pump [6], a ubiquitous transporter\nresponsible for the establishment of the trans-membrane Na+\n\nand K+ gradients. In a previous work we studied the 1 h effect of\nTNF-a on the Na+-/K+ ATPase in HepG2 cells. The activity of the\nATPase was found to be modulated by JNK, which stimulated the\nll rights reserved.\n\nyeh).\ncaspases and inhibited NF-jB, resulting in a net inhibition of the\npump, and probably favoring the apoptotic pathway [7]. Since\nTNF was reported also to promote cell proliferation in hepatocytes\n[8], we speculated that these antagonistic responses may be due to\ndifferences in the period of action of the cytokine. TNF-a may be\nactivating different mediators at different time intervals leading\nto opposite effects.\n\nThis work aimed at testing this hypothesis and determining the\nmechanism of action of the cytokine.\n2.

Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u2013318 313\nAll other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St.\nLouis, Missouri, USA.\n\n2.2. Methods\n\n2.2.1. Culture and treatment of HepG2 Cells\nHepG2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,\n\n1% Penicillin and streptomycin, in a humidified incubator (5% CO2)\nat 37 \ufffdC. When 70\u201380% confluence was reached, the cells were\nstarved overnight and treated next day.\n\nDose and time response studies were conducted by treating the\ncells with different doses of TNF-a (5, 10, 40, and 100 ng/ml) for\n4 h, and with 100 ng/ml of TNF-a for different time periods (1, 2,\n3, 4, 6, and 8 h). The involvement of caspases, JNK and NF-jB\nwas studied by pre-treating the cells with their respective specific\ninhibitors FK009 (4 lM) ([9], SP 600125 (50 lM) [10] and PDTC\n(100 lM) [11] . FK009 was added 15 min before TNF-a, while PDTC\nand SP 600125 were added 30 min before the cytokine.\n\nAt the end of the incubation period, HepG2 cells were washed,\nlysed, homogenized with a polytron at 4 \ufffdC and 20,000 rpm, and\npreserved at \ufffd20 \ufffdC for later use after addition of protease inhibi-\ntors. Proteins were quantified using the Biorad assay.\n\n2.2.2. Western blot analysis\nEqual amounts of protein were loaded and resolved on 8% poly-\n\nacrylamide gels, and were transferred to PVD F membranes. The\nmembranes were then blocked and incubated with a primary\nNa+/K+ ATPase a1 antibody, followed by a secondary IgG conju-\ngated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection of the signal was by en-\nhanced chemiluminescence. Equal loading was checked by\nPonceau staining, a rapid and reversible staining method for visu-\nalizing protein bands on Western blots.\n\n2.2.3. NF-jB activity\nActivation of NF-jB by TNF was investigated by examining the\n\ndegradation of its inhibitory subunit IjBa. The expression of IjB\nwas studied by western blot analysis as described above using 10%\npolyacrylamide gels and an anti-IjBa monoclonal antibody with a\ngoat anti-mouse secondary IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.\n\n2.2.4. Na+/K+ ATPase activity assay\nHomogenates of HepG2 cells were suspended in Tris buffer\n\n(1300 mM NaCl, 200 mM KCl, 40 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM histidine;\npH 7.4) to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. Saponin (1%) was then\nadded at a ratio of 1:4 and the samples were incubated at room\ntemperature for 30 min. Aliquots (50 ll) were then drawn and\nincubated at 37 \ufffdC for 30 min, in presence or absence of ouabain\n(3.75 mM final concentration), a specific inhibitor of the ATPase.\nAdenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) (7.5 mM final concentration) was\nthen added and the samples were incubated for an additional\n30 min at 37 \ufffdC. At the end of the incubation period, an equal vol-\nume of trichloroacetic acid (11.5%) was added to stop the reaction,\nand the samples were spun at 3000g for 5 min. The amount of\ninorganic phosphate liberated was measured colorimetrically\naccording to the method of Taussky and Shorr [12]. The enzymatic\nactivity was determined by measuring the ouabain inhibitable\ninorganic phosphate (Pi) released. The percent inhibition of the\nenzyme activity was calculated as follows:\n\n1\ufffd Pi\u00f0treatment\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0treatment \u00fe ouabain\u00de\nPi\u00f0control\u00de \ufffd Pi\u00f0control\u00fe ouabain\u00de\n\n\ufffd 100\nFig. 1b.

Briefly JNK\nwas immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and its activity deter-\nmined using recombinant c_jun as a substrate. Phosphorylation\nof c-Jun was detected by western blot analysis.\n2.2.6. Statistical analysis\nResults are reported as means \u00b1 SE and are tested for statistical\n\nsignificance by a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed\nby Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparisons test using Instat and Excel\nAnalysis softwares. The results were considered significant at\nP < 0.01.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Time and dose response studies on the effect of TNF-a on the Na+/\nK+ ATPase in HepG2 cells\n\nTNF-a at 100 ng/ml reduced the activity and protein expression\nof the Na+/K+ ATPase at 1 h, and enhanced them at 4, 6 and 8 h\n(Fig. 1a). The most prominent increase was observed at 4 h and\nwas maintained till 8 h (P < 0.001). This is why all further studies\nwere conducted at 4 h. The effect on pump\u2019s expression followed\nthe same pattern as the effect on the pump\u2019s activity (Fig. 1b).\n\nA dose response study was then conducted to see if the effect of\nthe cytokine on the pump is concentration-dependent. The activity\nof the Na+/K+ATPase was significantly increased in starved cells\ntreated for 4 h with 40 and 100 ng/ml TNF-a and unchanged at\nlower doses (5 and 10 ng/ml) (Fig. 1c).\n\nSince the up-regulatory effect observed at 4 h opposed what\nwas found previously at 1 h, we decided to investigate the 4-h re-\nsponse and the signaling pathways involved.\n\n\n\nFig. 1c.

Mediators of the late (4 h) effect of TNF-a on the Na+/K+ ATPase in\nHepG2 cells\n\n3.3.1. Involvement of JNK and NF-KB\nAt 4 h, TNF decreased the expression of IKBa (Fig. 2a) and in-\n\ncreased significantly the phosphorylation of c-jun (Fig. 2b) reveal-\ning an activation of NF-jB and JNK by the cytokine.\n\nThe involvement of NF-jB and Jun Kinase in the late (4 h) re-\nsponse was studied by using their respective inhibitors PDTC and\nSP600125.\n\nPDTC alone had no effect on the expression and activity of the\npump but abrogated completely the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a and\nb). The ATPase was down-regulated by SP600125 and in its pres-\nence the up-regulatory effect of TNF was significantly reduced\n(Fig. 3a and b).\n\n3.3.2. Involvement of caspases\nTo determine whether TNF-a signaling is mediated through\n\ncaspases, HepG2 cells were treated with FK009 a general caspase\ninhibitor. The inhibitor FK009 alone, increased both the activity\nand protein expression of the pump, exerting thus a similar effect\nto the one observed with TNF-a (Fig. 4a and b). The up-regulatory\neffect of TNF still appeared in presence of FK009 i.e. when caspases\nwere inhibited.\nFig. 2a. Effect of TNF-a (100 ng/ml, 4 h) on the expression of IjBa.\n\nFig. 2b.

Effect of different combinations of inhibitors on the protein\nexpression and activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase at 4 h\n\nWhen both jun Kinase and NF-jB were inhibited concurrently\nwith their respective inhibitors SP600125 and PDTC, a decrease\nin the activity and protein expression of the Na+/K+ ATPase was ob-\nserved (Fig. 3a and b). This decrease still appeared in presence of\nthe cytokine.\n\nThe up-regulatory effect exerted by FK009 was reduced in pres-\nence of PDTC (Fig. 5a and b), but in their simultaneous presence the\n\n\n\nFig. 4b.

Acti-\nvation of the caspase cascade leads to apoptosis [13], while activa-\ntion of NF-jB, induces genes having anti-apoptotic effects. Many\nworks demonstrated that apoptosis is accompanied by a reduction\nin the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase in various experimental models\nwhile stimulation of the ATPase was found to accompany liver\nregeneration [14]. Although many isoforms of the enzyme are\nknown to exist, the a1 isoform is the one present in hepatocytes\n[15].\n\n4.1. Time and dose response studies\n\nTNF acted on the Na+/K+ ATPase time-dependently (Fig. 1a).\nChanges in the ATPase activity and protein expression followed a\nsimilar trend (Fig. 1a and b), suggesting that changes in activity\nare due to changes in the number of ATPase molecules. To deter-\nmine whether these opposite responses are also dose-dependent,\ncells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-a for\n4hrs. At 4 h, TNF-a at doses equal or higher than 40 ng/ml exerted\na stimulatory effect on the ATPase (Fig. 1c). Since an increase in\npump\u2019s activity was reported to occur during liver regeneration\n[16], it can be speculated that TNF promotes at 4 h cell survival.\n\nThe mechanism underlying the early inhibitory response was\nstudied in a previous work [8]. This work is an attempt to unravel\nthe signaling mechanism behind the 4 h-response.\nTable 1\nA summary of the effect of different inhibitors on the Na+/K+ ATPase.\n\nTNF-a PDTC SP00125 FK009\n\n+\n+\n\n+ +\n+\n\n+ +\n+\n\n+ +\n+ +\n\n+ + +\n+ +\n\n+ + +\n+ +\n\n+ + +\n+ + +\n\n+ + + +\n4.2. Signaling mediators\n\n4.2.1. TNF stimulates NF-jB\nInhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated completely the effect\n\nof TNF-a. The results imply that the effect of TNF-a on NF-jB is\nstimulatory because had it been inhibitory, then PDTC would have\nimitated the effect of TNF-a and an up-regulatory effect would\nhave been observed.\n\n4.2.2. TNF stimulates JNK\nTreating the cells with SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK)\n\nabrogated only partially the effect of TNF-a (Fig. 3a and b) suggest-\ning the presence of additional mediators that contribute to the ef-\nfect of TNF on the pump. JNK should be stimulated by the cytokine\nas was the case with NF-jB and for the same reasons mentioned\nabove for NF-jB.\n\n4.2.3. TNF inhibits caspases\nThe up-regulatory response to TNF-a still appeared in presence\n\nof FK009 (Fig. 4a and b), indicating that either caspases are not in-\nvolved in TNF action, or if they are, they are inhibited by the cyto-\nkine. In the latter case, caspase inhibition should imitate the effect\nof TNF-a and this is in fact what was observed when FK009 was\nadded alone (Fig. 4a and b). Addition of TNF-a simultaneously with\nFK009, lead to a similar response to the one observed with each\none separately, inferring that caspases are part of the signaling\npathway activated by TNF or else an additive effect would have\nbeen observed.\n\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of NF-jB\nand JNK, and inhibition of caspases. No additional mediators are in-\nvolved in TNF signaling, since when cells were treated with the\ncytokine in presence of inhibitors of all three mediators the effect\nof TNF-a disappeared completely (Fig. 7a and b).\n\n4.3. Positions of the signaling mediators in the pathway\n\n4.3.1. JNK is upstream of NF-jB\nIt is apparent from the above that caspases, in the basal state,\n\nexert an inhibitory effect on the activity and protein expression\nof the Na+/K+ ATPase (Fig. 4a and b).\n\nThe effect of JNK is however stimulatory since a down-regula-\ntion was observed when it was inhibited with SP 600125. Inhibi-\ntion of NF-jB did not have any effect on the pump, suggesting\nthat the transcription factor is not involved in its regulation in\nthe basal state.\n\nThe fact that the effect of FK009 was abrogated partially with\nPDTC but fully with PDTC + SP600125, suggests that NF-jB and\nEffect on ATPase protein expression Effect on ATPase activity\n\nUp-regulation Up-regulation\nNo effect No effect\nNo effect No effect\nDown-regulation Down-regulation\nReduced up-regulation Reduced up-regulation\nUp-regulation Up-regulation\nUp-regulation Up-regulation\nDown-regulation Down-regulation\nDown-regulation Down-regulation\nReduced up-regulation Reduced up-regulation\nUp-regulation Up-regulation\nNo effect No Effect\nUp-regulation Up-regulation\nNo effect No effect\nNo effect No effect\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

Kassardjian et al. / Cytokine 49 (2010) 312\u2013318 317\nJNK activate two different pathways that stimulate the pump. It\ncan be postulated that the basal activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase is a\nbalance between two stimulatory pathways mediated via JNK\nand NF-jB, and an inhibitory pathway mediated via caspases.\nWhen caspases are inhibited, the stimulatory effect of JNK and\nNF-jB becomes apparent. When caspases and NF-jB are inhibited\nconcurrently, the up-regulatory effect is reduced because it be-\ncomes restricted only to the one caused by JNK. However when\nJNK and caspases are inhibited concurrently, leaving only NF-jB\nactive, no change is observed in the ATPase activity and expression.\nAs the up-regulatory effect of NF-jB was not observed in this case,\nit can be postulated that it is activated by either JNK or caspases.\nSince the effect of FK009 disappeared partially in presence of PDTC\nbut fully in presence of SP600125 and SP600125 + PDTC, it can\nsafely be concluded that JNK is upstream of NF-jB and causes its\nactivation.\n\nWhen JNK and NF-jB were inhibited simultaneously (Fig. 3a\nand b), leaving only the caspases active, down-regulation of the\npump was observed. This confirms the inhibitory effect of caspases\non the ATPase, an effect that was not counterbalanced anymore, in\nthis case, by the stimulatory effect of JNK and NF-jB.\n\n4.3.2. JNK is upstream of caspases\nThe effect of TNF was abrogated partially in presence of\n\nSP600125 alone but reappeared in the simultaneous presence of\nFK009 and SP600125. It can be speculated that TNF-a inhibits\nthe caspases via activation of JNK, freeing thus the ATPase from\ntheir down-regulatory effect. The data indicate also that JNK is up-\nstream of caspases.\n\n4.3.3. NF-jB is upstream of caspases\nInhibition of NF-jB with PDTC abrogated the effect of TNF and\n\nalthough JNK is still active, no up-regulation was observed because\nit was counteracted by an inhibition caused by active caspases.\nHowever, TNF effect reappeared upon simultaneous inhibition of\nNF-jB and caspases, implying that when NF-jB is active, it inhibits\ncaspases and is upstream of them.\n\nWhen JNK and NF-jB are inhibited concurrently, the ATPase is\ndown-regulated by TNF-a because the caspases remain active and\nare not inhibited by NF-jB.\n\nThe cytokine could not exert its effect in presence of inhibitors\nof all three mediators since all stimulatory and inhibitory path-\nways are blocked. The results infer that no additional mediators\nare involved in the response to TNF-a.\n\n4.4. Signaling pathway of TNF-a\n\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a acts via stimulation of JNK and\nNF-jB, and inhibition of caspases. NF-jB is upstream of the casp-\nases and inhibits them while JNK is upstream of NF-jB and acti-\nvates it and is itself activated by TNF-a. TNF activates also NF-jB\nbut this activity is considerably enhanced by JNK. Fig. 8 represents\nthe postulated signaling pathway underlying the effect of TNF-a on\nthe Na+/K+ATPase at 4 h.\n\n4.5. Possible implications of the up-regulatory effect of TNF-a on the\nNa+/K+ATPase: roles of the mediators\n\nUp-regulation of the pump by TNF-a is suggestive of an anti-\napoptotic state. In fact, in liver regeneration, the activity of the\nNa+/K+ATPase was found to be increased [17,7] and NF-jB acti-\nvated [7].\n\nThe anti-apoptotic effect of NF-jB in hepatocytes has been very\nwell documented and its cytoprotective function has been reported\nby many studies in various cell types [18\u201323]. Mice deficient in NF-\njB activation have been shown to be more susceptible to hepato-\ncarcinogenesis [24]. By activating NF-jB, the cytokine induces a\nnumber of anti-apoptotic genes, including c-FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, A1,\nA20, TRAF1, and TRAF2 [5].\n\nOn the other hand caspases have been well recognized as key\nmediators of apoptosis and cell death [25,26]. Since an anti-apop-\ntotic state prevails at 4hrs, the observed inhibition of caspases is\nexpected.\n\nThe role of JNK is however till now highly controversial. Many\nworks correlated activation of JNK with cell death. The kinase\nwas shown to play a central role in mediating the TNF-induced\napoptotis in hepatocytes [27,28] and developing embryonic fore-\nbrain [29,30]. Other studies however, did not find any association\nbetween JNK and cell death [31].\n\nIn this work JNK activation seems to have an anti-apoptotic role,\npromoting cell survival and proliferation. These findings are in line\nwith those reporting a role of JNK in oncogenesis [32\u201334].\n\nThe TNF-induced activation of JNK observed in this work is\nneeded to activate in turn NF-jB. One possible mechanism by\nwhich the kinase could activate the transcription factor would\nbe by phosphorylating directly or indirectly IjB kinase (IKK)\nleading to its activation. IKK would in turn phosphorylate the\ninhibitory protein IjB on serine residues [34] targeting it for ubiq-\nuitination and subsequent degradation, and leading consequently\nto NF-jB activation [18]. Active NF-jB then inhibits caspases.\nSuch an effect has been demonstrated before in fibroblasts by Tang\net al. [35].\n\nIt can be concluded that TNF-a exerts a time-dependent dual\nand opposite effect on the pump. The early 1 h response is inhibi-\ntory and suggestive of an apoptotic state while the later response\nat 4 h is stimulatory and suggestive of cell survival conditions.\nAlthough in both responses JNK is activated and is the key player,\nyet it exerts opposite effects on its targets namely NF-jB and\ncaspases which mediate, respectively, cell survival and apoptosis.\nCaspases are active at 1 h but become inhibited at 4 h. The intrigu-\ning question that needs to be addressed is why is there a transient\nand early activation of caspases that is followed by inhibition? Is\nthis a step in preparation for the anti-apoptotic state that will ap-\npear at 4 h? Su et al. [36] demonstrated previously that a defi-\nciency in caspase 8 abolished the activation of NF-jB induced by\nantigen receptors, Fc receptors, or Toll-like receptor 4 in T, B, and\nnatural killer cells, ascribing thus a role for caspases in the activa-\ntion of the transcription factor. It would be plausible then to as-\nsume that here again, the early and transient activation of\ncaspases aims at triggering the activation of NF-jB which in turn\nwould shut them down.\n\n\n\n318 A.

Previous studies have identified that Terminalia catappa leaf extracts (TCE) exert hepatoprotective, antioxidative,\nantiinflammatory, anticancer, and antimetastatic activities. However, the effects of TCE on HCC and the underlying molecular\nmechanisms of its activities have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study\u2019s findings demonstrate that TCE concentration\ndependently inhibits human HCC migration/invasion. Zymographic and western blot analyses revealed that TCE inhibited\nthe activities and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Assessment of mRNA levels, using reverse transcriptase\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR, and promoter assays confirmed the inhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9\nexpression in HCC cells. The inhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9 proceeded by upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-\n1 (TIMP-1), as well as suppressing nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and\nactivating protein-1 (AP-1) on the MMP-9 promoter in Huh7 cells. In conclusion, TCE inhibits MMP-9 expression and HCC\ncell metastasis and, thus, has potential use as a chemopreventive agent. Its inhibitory effects are associated with downregulation of\nthe binding activities of the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant\nneoplasm and major cause of cancer-related deaths in Asian\ncountries. A high mortality rate for HCC in Taiwan is princi-\npally caused by uncontrolled tumor invasion and metastasis\n[1]. Cancer cell metastasis involves multiple processes and\nvarious cytophysiological changes, including changes in the\n\nadhesive capability between cells and the extracellular matrix\n(ECM). This involves proteolytic degradation and damaged\nintracellular interaction. Degradation of the ECM by cancer\ncells occurs through proteases, such as serine proteinase\nand the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This leads to\nthe separation of the intercellular matrix to promote the\nmobility of cancer cells, eventually leading to metastasis\n[2]. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9 or gelatinase B,\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n92 kDa) is the proteases most significantly involved in the\ndegradation of the basement membrane and, thus, in tumor\ninvasion and metastasis. A number of pathological states,\nincluding cancer, inflammation, and vascular diseases, are\nassociated with increased proteinase activities [3, 4]. The\nexpression of MMPs is regulated by various factors, such\nas growth factors, cytokines, and proteinase inhibitors. The\nendogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)\nare the specific inhibitors of MMPs. Imbalance between\nthe MMPs and TIMPs might, therefore, contribute to\ndegradation or deposition of the ECM [5, 6]. Inhibition of\nMMP-mediated migration or invasion could thus provide a\nmeans of preventing cancer metastasis.\n\nTerminalia is a genus of combretaceous plants widely\ndistributed in tropical and subtropical regions. In several\nAsian countries, physicians have used the leaves, bark, and\nfruit of Terminalia catappa to treat dermatitis and pyresis.\nTerminalia catappa leaf extracts (TCE) contain flavonoids\nand hydrolysable tannins, which have preventive effects\non hepatoma and reduce hepatotoxicity. The antioxidative,\nhepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and carcinogenesis-\npreventing effects of TCE could potentially provide ben-\nefits to human health [7\u20139]. The group\u2019s previous study\nshowed that TCE can inhibit lung cancer metastasis in vivo\nand in vitro [9]. However, the effects of TCE on HCC\ninvasion and metastasis, and the underlying mechanisms\nof the antimetastatic effects, have yet to be evaluated. The\npresent study, therefore, investigated the potential inhibitory\neffects of TCE on hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7 cell)\ninvasiveness, and the possible mechanisms of TCE-induced\nantimetastatic effects.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Preparation of Terminalia catappa Leaves Extracts (TCE).\nTerminalia catappa leaves were purchased from local herb\nstores in Taichung and the TCE were prepared by an\ninitial condensation followed by lyophilization as described\npreviously [9]. Briefly, 100 g of air-dried leaves were boiled at\n70\u25e6C for 24 h with 500 mL of 50% ethanol. The extraction\nprocedure was repeated twice. Then, solvent was removed\nfrom the combined extract with a vacuum rotary evaporator.\nThe filtrate was then lyophilized and stored at \u221220\u25e6C.\nFurthermore, the chemical profile of TCE was analyzed by\nusing high-pressure liquid chromatograms (HPLC) mass\nspectrometer as described previously [9]. For subsequent\nexperiments, TCE powder was dissolved in 50% in dimethyl\nsulfoxide (DMSO) to achieve an indicated concentra-\ntion with the highest concentration of DMSO less than\n0.1%.\n\n2.2. Cell Culture and TCE Treatment. HCC (Huh7) cells\nobtained from Food Industry Research and Development\nInstitute (Hsinchu, Taiwan) was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s mod-\nified Eagle\u2019s medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY,\nUSA), 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL\npenicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, and 400 ng/mL hydro-\ncortisone. All cell cultures were maintained at 37\u25e6C n a\n\nhumidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For TCE treatment,\nappropriate amounts of stock solution of TCE were added\ninto culture medium to achieve the indicated concentrations\nand then incubated with cells for indicated time periods,\nwhereas dimethyl sulfoxide solution without TCE was used\nas blank reagent.\n\n2.3. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). For cell\nviability experiment, a microculture tetrazolium (3-(4,5-d\nimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) col-\norimetric assay was performed to determine the cytotoxi-\ncity of TCE [10, 11]. Huh7 cells were seeded in 24-well\nplates at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well and treated with TCE\nat a concentration between 0\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL at 37\u25e6C for 24 h.\nAfter the exposure period, the media was removed, and cells\nwere washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then\nincubated with 20 \u03bcL MTT (5 mg/mL) (Sigma chemical Co.,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. The viable cell number per dish\nis directly proportional to the production of formazan, which\ncan be measured spectrophotometrically at 563 nm following\nsolubilization with isopropanol.\n\n2.4. In Vitro Wound Closure. Huh7 cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well)\nwere plated in 6-well plates for 24 h, wounded by scratching\nwith a pipette tip, then incubated with DMEM medium\ncontaining 0.5% FBS and treated with or without TCE (0,\n25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 0, 12, and 24 h. Cells were\nphotographed using a phase-contrast microscope (\u00d7100).\n\n2.5. Cell Invasion and Migration Assays. Cell invasion and\nmigration were assayed according to the methods described\nby Yang et al. [12]. After a treatment with TCE (0, 25, 50,\n75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h, surviving cells were harvested\nand seeded to Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John,\nMD, USA) at 104 cells/well in serum-free medium and then\nincubated for 24 hours at 37\u25e6C. For invasion assay, 10 \u03bcL\nMatrigel (25 mg/50 mL; BD Biosciences, MA, USA) was\napplied to 8 \u03bcm pore size polycarbonate membrane filters\nand the bottom chamber contained standard medium. Filters\nwere then air-dried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. The\ninvaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained\nwith 5% Giemsa. Cell numbers were counted under a light\nmicroscope. The migration assay was carried out as described\nin the invasion assay with no coating of Matrigel [13].\n\n2.6. Determination of MMP-9 by Zymography. The activities\nof MMP-9 in conditional medium were measured by gelatin\nzymography protease assays as previously described [12].\nBriefly, collected media of an appropriate volume (adjusted\nby vital cell number) were prepared with SDS sample buffer\nwithout boiling or reduction and subjected to 0.1% gelatin-\n8% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels\nwere washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated\nin reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM CaCl2\nand 0.01% NaN3) for 12 h at 37\u25e6C. Then gel was stained with\nCoomassie brilliant blue R-250.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nC\nel\n\nl v\nia\n\nbi\nlit\n\ny \n(%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\nol\n\n) \n20\n\n0\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0 25 50 75 100\n\nTCE concentration (\u03bcg/mL)\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n12 hr 24 hr\n\n100 \u03bcg/mL\n75 \u03bcg/mL\n\n50 \u03bcg/mL\n25 \u03bcg/mL\nControl\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nbe\n\nr \nof\n\n m\nig\n\nra\nte\n\nd \nce\n\nlls\n (\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\nol\n)\n\n0 hr\n\n12 hr\n\n24 hr\n\n0 25 50 75 100\n\nTCE concentration (\u03bcg/mL)\n\nTCE concentration (\u03bcg/mL)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: Effect of TCE on cell viability and in vitro wound closure in Huh7 cells.

Preparation of Total Cell Lysates and Nuclear Fraction.\nFor total cell lysates preparation, cells were rinsed with PBS\ntwice and scraped with 0.2 mL of cold RIPA buffer containing\nprotease inhibitors cocktail, and then vortexed at 4\u25e6C for\n10 min. Cell lysates were subjected to a centrifugation of\n10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u25e6C, and the insoluble pellet was\ndiscarded. Nuclear extracts were obtained using a modifica-\ntion of a previously described method [13]. Briefly, harvested\ncells were scraped and lysed with buffer A (10 mM HEPES,\n10 mM KC1, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% NP40,\n\n1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride),\nfollowed by vortexing to shear the cytoplasmic membranes\nand nuclear pellets were collected by a centrifugation at\n3000 rpm for 30 s at 4\u25e6C. Nuclear proteins were extracted\nwith high-salt buffer B (20 mM HEPES, 25% glycerol,\n1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT,\nand 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein\nconcentration of total cell lysates and nuclear fraction were\ndetermined by Bradford assay [15].\n\n2.9. Western Blot Analysis.

Statistical significances of difference\nthroughout this study were calculated by Student\u2019s t-test\n(Sigma-Stat 2.0, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA, USA). A\ndifference at P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically\nsignificant and the experiments were repeated three times.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effects of TCE on Huh7 Cell Viability. Figure 1(a) displays\nthe cytotoxic effects of various concentrations of TCE\n(0 \u03bcg/mL to 100 \u03bcg/mL) on Huh7 cells. Results from MTT\nassay revealed that TCE did not influence Huh7 cell viability\nat all tested concentrations. A lower TCE concentration range\nwas, thus, used for all subsequent experiments.\n\n3.2. Effects of TCE on Wound Closure, Invasion, and Migration\nof Huh7 Cells In Vitro. Figure 1(b) displays the findings from\nwound closure assay to evaluate the effects of TCE on Huh7\ncell migration, showing representative photographs of Huh7\ncells migrating into scratch wounds following treatment with\nTCE. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) demonstrate the effects of TCE\non cell migration and invasion in Huh7 cells treated with\n0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL TCE for 16 h (cell migration)\n\nand 24 h (cell invasion). Cell migration and invasion assays\nusing a Boyden chamber revealed that TCE induced marked\nreductions in the invasion and migration abilities of Huh7\ncells in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\n3.3. Effects of TCE on the Expression of MMP-9 and Its\nEndogenous Inhibitor. The Huh7 cells were treated with TCE\n(0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 h, and then subjected\nto gelatin zymography to analyze MMP-9 activity. As shown\nin Figures 3(a)-3(b), TCE treatment reduced MMP-9 activity\nin a dose-dependent manner. Figure 3(c) shows Western blot\nanalysis of the expression of MMP-9 and its endogenous\ninhibitor TIMP-1. The MMP-9 and TIMP-1 protein levels\nwere adjusted using \u03b2-actin. Following TCE treatment,\nMMP-9 expression decreased significantly, whereas TIMP-1\nexpression increased (Figure 3(d)).\n\n3.4. Effects of TCE on MMP-9 Transcription. To evaluate the\ninhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9 expression in Huh7\ncells, Huh7 cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, and\n100 \u03bcg/mL TCE for 24 h, and then subjected to reverse trans-\ncriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time\nPCR to analyze mRNA levels. After treatment with various\nconcentrations of TCE, the levels of MMP-9 mRNA showed\nmarked decreases in a concentration-dependent manner\n(Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Promoter analysis using a luciferase\nassay kit identified significant inhibition of the luciferase\nactivities of MMP-9 (Figure 4(c)). These results indicate that\nTCE regulates the expression of MMP-9, at least partially, at\na transcriptional level.\n\n3.5.

Chromatin immunoprecipita-\ntion (ChIP) assay then investigated the involvement of these\ntranscription factors in the TCE-induced transcriptional\ninhibition of MMP-9 (Figure 5(a)). Results from quantitative\nreal-time PCR indicated that TCE significantly reduced the\nbinding of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 to the MMP-9 promoters\n(Figure 5(b)).\n\nTo further investigate the involvement of AP-1 and NF-\n\u03baB in the transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 by TCE in\nHuh7 cells, the effects of TCE on nuclear translocation\nof NF-\u03baB, c-fos, and c-Jun were evaluated.

These findings indicated\nthat TCE might induce transcriptional inhibition of MMP-\n9 in Huh7 cells by suppressing NF-\u03baB and AP-1 nuclear\ntranslocation and MMP-9 promoter binding activity.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nHerbal products are used worldwide in the prevention and\ntreatment of various chronic diseases, and their potential\nanticancer and antimetastatic effects are currently under\ninvestigation. Terminalia catappa leaf extracts exert a range\nof biological effects on cells, including antioxidant and hep-\natoprotective activity on hepatocytes and liver mitochondria,\nand preventive activity against hepatocyte apoptosis [16\u201319].\nIn previous studies, water extracts of TCE could effectively\n\nreduce carbon-tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced hepatotoxicity\nand bleomycin-induced genotoxicity of Chinese hamster\novary cells [20, 21]. Tang et al. reported that ethanol extracts\nof TCE contain higher active components than water extracts\nof TCE [8]. In an earlier study, the same group identified that\nchloroform extracts of TCE induce hepatoprotective effects\nthat might be related to the regulation of liver IL-6 gene\nexpression [22]. Different methods of extraction of TCE can,\ntherefore, influence the physiological nature of the active\ncompound and modify its effects directly.\n\nAs described in previous studies, the protective activities\nof TCE against liver mitochondrial damage induced by car-\nbon tetrachloride (CCl4) might be related to the inhibition of\nIL-6 gene overexpression [20, 23]. Studies have also suggested\nthat its protective effects might be related to the scavenging\nof reactive oxygen species (ROS) [20, 21, 24]. The groups\nof Fan and Tang speculated that TCE might prevent DNA\ndamage and carcinogenesis by inhibiting ROS generation\nor reducing DNA adduct formation [19, 25]. In the study\nof Wen et al., T. catappa L. hydrophilic extract (TCLW)\ninhibited MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 expressions at a\nrange of concentrations and promoted the expression of type\nI procollagen by inhibiting MMP-1, -3, and -9 activities.\nThis afforded it antiaging activity and potential cosmetic\nuse [24]. Ko et al. also described that SC-CO2 extract of\nTCE exhibited potent antimutagenicity and demonstrated\nhigher cytotoxicity against HCC cells than against normal\nliver cells. Therefore, TCE is a potent antioxidant and might\nprovide a novel source of biomedicinal phytochemicals for\ncancer prevention [26]. However, constraints on the use of\nherbal products for prevention of cancer metastasis have yet\nto be cleared, and the underlying biological mechanisms of\n\n\n\n10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\ntheir activities have yet to be fully characterized. Our group\u2019s\nprevious studies identified that TCE induces antimetastatic\neffects in lung cancer (A549, Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and\noral cancer cells (SCC-4) [5, 9]. The present study\u2019s results\nindicate that TCE also exerts inhibitory effects on HCC cell\nmetastasis through regulation of MMP-9. Morioka et al.\nreported that TCE has a potent short-term chemopreventive\neffect on biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis and might\nbe associated with inhibition of the development of aber-\nrant crypt foci (ACF) and beta-catenin-accumulated crypts\n(BCACs) [27]. It is, therefore, possible that other proteases\nare involved in the antimetastatic effects of TCE on HCC.\nFurther investigation is needed to confirm the involvement\nof other antimetastatic mechanisms, and changes in the\nexpression of proteases, in TCE-induced effects.\n\nTranscription of the MMP-9 gene is regulated by\nupstream sequences, including motifs corresponding to NF-\n\u03baB or AP-1 binding sites [6, 28, 29]. In the present study,\nTCE inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 to the\nMMP-9 promoter in Huh7 cells. The transcription nuclear\nfactors NF-\u03baB and AP-1 can promote tumorigenesis and are\nlinked to invasion and metastasis. In the study by Aggarwal,\ninhibition of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activities was effective in the\nprevention and treatment of cancer [30]. This result was\nsimilar to the group\u2019s previous finding that norcantharidin\n(NCTD) exerted inhibitory effects on metastasis in HCC cells\n[6]. Activation of NF-\u03baB occurs through the phosphorylation\nof I\u03baB\u03b1. This releases NF-\u03baB, which then translocates from\nthe cytosol to the nucleus to regulate gene expression at a\ntranscriptional level. In the present study, TCE treatment\nresulted in inhibition of NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity,\naccompanied by inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, leading\nto the downregulation of MMP-9.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study\u2019s findings demonstrate\nthat TCE exerts inhibitory effects on several critical stages\nof metastasis, including cell invasion and migration, by\nregulating the activities of metastasis-associated proteases\nand their natural inhibitors. Terminalia Catappa leaf extracts\nmight, therefore, have potential use in the development\nof preventive and treatment agents for cancer metastasis.\nTerminalia catappa leaf extracts inhibit NF-\u03baB and AP-1\nDNA binding activities effectively, resulting in the down-\nregulation of MMP-9 expression and the inhibition of\nmetastasis (Figure 7). By targeting the signal transduction\nmediators and transcriptional factors involved in the TCE\nantimetastatic process in human hepatoma cells, it might\nbe possible to develop specific mediators to inhibit cell\nmetastasis. Further in vivo analysis is needed to confirm\nthe effectiveness of TCE in the prevention or treatment of\nhepatoma invasion or migration.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nTCE: Terminalia catappa leaf extracts\nECM: Extracellular matrix\nMMP: Matrix metalloproteinase\nTIMP: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase\n\nHCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma\nChIP: Chromatin immunoprecipitation.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis study was supported by a Research Grant from Chung\nShan Medical University Hospital, Taiwan (CSH-2012-C-\n006).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] T.

However, the\ncell-signaling pathways linking interleukin-8 (IL-8), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and dexa-\nmethasone in hPDL cells have not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)\nkinases in dexamethasone- and TNF-a-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in hPDL cells. IL-8 production was measured by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. MAP kinase\nactivation and IjB degradation were determined by Western blot analysis, and ICAM-1 expression was determined by RT-PCR and\nFACS analysis. TNF-a increased IL-8 mRNA expression and protein secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Dexamethasone\nsuppressed TNF-a-induced IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, dexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-induced phos-\nphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), IjB degradation, and NF-jB activation. Selective inhibitors\nfor ERKs and p38 attenuated TNF-a-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in the presence and absence of dexamethasone, indicating\nthat MAP kinases play a role in the response of hDPL cells to TNF-a. Furthermore, these results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-\nand dexamethasone-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1, produced via a MAP kinase pathway, may serve as an important mediator of PDL\nimmunoregulation involved in bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement.\n\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Kim).\nspace, where they differentiate into mature osteoclasts. The\nosteoclasts then resorb alveolar bone upon stimulation by\nPDL-derived cytokines [3]. The mechanisms by which\ninflammatory cytokines mediate osteoclast formation and\nbone resorption are not completely understood, however,\nparticularly in human PDL (hPDL) cells.\n\nThe chemotactic cytokine known as interleukin 8 (IL-8)\nand the cell-surface adhesion molecule known as intercellu-\nlar adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are major mediators of\ninflammation that contribute to sequestration of neutro-\nphils at sites of tissue injury [4]. IL-8 is a member of the\nCXC chemokine family of cytokines that were originally\nidentified as monocyte-derived factors capable of attracting\n\nmailto:eckwkop@wonkwang.ac.kr\n\n\n68 H.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376\nand activating neutrophils [5,6]. IL-8 is produced by a vari-\nety of cell types, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and\nendothelial cells, in response to inflammation and injury\n[7]. IL-8 is increasingly being recognized as a multifunc-\ntional cytokine with other activities, in addition to its activ-\nity as a chemokine.\n\nIn bone, IL-8 is synthesized by osteoblasts and osteo-\nclasts [8]. Bendre et al. [9] demonstrated that the actions\nof IL-8 related to bone resorption are both indirect and\ndirect. IL-8 indirectly stimulates expression of osteoblast\nreceptor activator of NF-jB ligand (RANKL), and it\ndirectly affects the osteoclastogenic response of human\nosteoclast precursors. Recently, Tuncer et al. [10] observed\nthat orthodontic forces lead to an increase in IL-8 and sub-\nsequent accumulation of neutrophils, suggesting that IL-8\ntriggers bone remodeling. Thus, IL-8 may be important\nin regulation of bone formation and resorption during\northodontic tooth movement.\n\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a is an inflammatory cyto-\nkine that appears to be an important mediator of bone\ndestruction in inflammatory disease [11]. TNF-a is primar-\nily produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, and\nosteoblasts, and it stimulates osteoclast differentiation\nand osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro and in vivo [12].\nVarious studies have shown that prostaglandin E (PGE),\nIL-1b, and TNF-a are increased in human gingival crevic-\nular fluid during orthodontic tooth movement [13,14]. Fur-\nthermore, TNF-a has recently been reported to enhance\nexpression of IL-8 mRNA and secretion of IL-8 protein\nin various cell types [8,15,16]. Therefore, TNF-a is believed\nto play a key role in the biological processes involved in\northodontic tooth movement.\n\nThe roles of glucocorticoids in osteoclast formation and\nactivation have been extensively examined in vivo and\nin vitro, with conflicting results. These osteotropic factors\nare thus assumed to play different roles in different micro-\nenvironments and cell types [17,18]. In a study by Pharoah\nand Heersche [19], dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorti-\ncoid analog, inhibited the formation of osteoclast-like cells\nin bone marrow cultures. However, in other studies, gluco-\ncorticoids increased osteoclast formation and activity\nthrough both direct and indirect mechanisms [17,18,20].\nHirayama et al. [21] reported that dexamethasone directly\naffected osteoclast formation and activity, stimulating the\nproliferation and differentiation of human osteoclast pre-\ncursors, and inhibiting the bone resorption activity of\nmature osteoclasts. In the present study, we investigated\nthe effects of dexamethasone in the presence of various\nosteotropic factors to gain additional insight regarding its\nrole in hDPL cells.\n\nThe mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPKs)\ncomprise well-conserved signaling pathways and include\nextracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-ter-\nminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPK. These activated\nkinases initiate a cascade of protein phosphorylation that\nactivates nuclear transcription factors, such as NF-jB,\nand AP-1. These transcription factors subsequently pro-\nmote expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,\nand ICAMs [22,23].\n\nWe hypothesized that orthodontic tooth movement\ncauses inflammation and release of IL-8- and ICAM-1-in-\nducing cytokines by activating MAPK signaling pathways\nin hPDL cells. In the present study, we focused on IL-8\nsecretion and ICAM-1 expression because these molecules\nare known to play important roles in the recruitment of cir-\nculating inflammatory cells. We investigated the effects of\nTNF-a and dexamethasone on the production of chemo-\nkines and ICAM-1 via activation of MAPK signaling path-\nways in primary cultured hPDL cells.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Reagents\n\nTNF-a and polyclonal goat anti-human IL-8 antibodies\n(Abs) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,\nMN, USA). SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from\nCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA, USA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-\nhuman IL-8 Abs was purchased from Endogen (Woburn,\nMA, USA). Abs against p38 kinase, ERK1/2, and the\nAbs specific to the phosphorylated forms of these proteins\nwere purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,\nMA, USA). Horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated\nanti-rabbit IgG was from Amersham Biosciences (Little\nChalfont, UK). Anti-human I-jBa or antiphospho-I-jBa\nwere from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA,\nUSA). Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM),\nKGM medium (Clonetics), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and\nother tissue culture reagents were purchased from Gibco-\nBRL (Grand Island, NY, USA). Dexamethasone and all\nother chemicals were bought from Sigma Chemical Co.\n(St. Louis, MO, USA) unless indicated otherwise.\n\n2.2. Primary culture of hPDL cells\n\nhPDL cells were isolated with an explant culture tech-\nnique from patients, with an age under 25 years undergoing\northodontic treatment by following described methods [24].\nInformed written consent from donors were obtained for\nuse of the tissues. Patients signed the corresponding\ninformed consent approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard at Wonkwang University for used of the tissues.\nBriefly, these tissues were cut into 1 mm2 explants and\nplaced on a 100 mm culture dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL,\nUSA) containing 10,000 U/ml of penicillin G sodium,\n10,000 lg/ml of streptomycin sulphate, 25 lg/ml of\namphotericin B, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine\nserum (FBS; Gibco-BRL, Grand island, NY, USA) at\n37 \ufffdC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%\nair. After 2 or 3 days, cells started to outgrow from the\nexplants. When the primary cell culture reached conflu-\nence, cells were detached with 0.025% trypsin and 0.05%\nEDTA, diluted with culture medium, and then subcultured\nin a ratio of 1:4. Cell cultures between the 5th and 7th\n\n\n\nH.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376 69\npassage were used in this study. Alkaline phosphatase\nactivity for 3 days was checked before the experiments.\n\n2.3. ELISA for IL-8 protein measurement\n\nhPDL cells were seeded at 2 \u00b7 105 into 24-well plates\n(Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY, USA) and\ngrown until formation of confluent monolayers, reaching\na final density of 5 \u00b7 105 cells/well. Monolayers were then\nincubated for 4\u201348 h in a fresh medium containing stimuli\nas indicated. The supernatants were collected, cleared by\ncentrifugation, and kept at \ufffd20 \ufffdC until evaluation by\nELISA. For measurement of IL-8 concentrations in cell\nculture supernatants, 96-well microtiter plates (MaxiSorp;\nNunc) were coated with 0.2 lg/well goat anti-human IL-8\nAbs (R&D Systems) in 50 ll of PBS at 4 \ufffdC overnight. All\nfurther steps were conducted at room temperature. After\nwashing three times with PBS, nonspecific binding sites\nwere blocked by incubation with 150 ll PBS + 1% BSA/\n0.05% Tween 20/well for 2 h. After three washes with\nPBS, 50 ll of samples or IL-8 standards were added and\nincubated for 2 h. As a second Ab, 0.05 lg/well polyclonal\nrabbit anti-human IL-8 (Endogen) was added and incu-\nbated for 2 h. As a third Ab, alkaline phosphatase-labeled\nmonoclonal mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) was\ndiluted in 50 ll of PBS + 0.1% BSA/0.05% Tween 20 to\n1:50,000 and incubated for 2 h. Finally, alkaline phospha-\ntase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich)\nwas added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.1 M glycine\nbuffer (pH 10.4) containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM\nZnCl2. After overnight incubation, plates were read at\n405 nm on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sun-\nnyvale, CA, USA). The detection limit of the ELISA\nwas 30 pg/ml.\n\n2.4. Cell viability assay\n\nViable cells were detected using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-\n2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye, which\nforms blue formazan crystals that are reduced by mito-\nchondrial dehydrogenase present in living cells. Briefly,\n2 \u00b7 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured\novernight for cell attachment. After cell treatment, 50 ll\nof MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each\nwell and incubated for 4 h. To each well, 50 ll of DMSO\nwere added. The plates were then shaken until the crystals\nhad dissolved. Reduced MTT was then measured spectro-\nphotometrically in a dual beam microtiter plate reader at\n570 nm.\n\n2.5. RNA isolation and RT-PCR\n\nCells were grown in 60-mm culture dishes and incubated\nfor 4\u201324 h in a fresh medium containing stimuli as indicat-\ned. After discarding growth medium, total RNA was iso-\nlated from cells using easy-Blue (iNtRON Biotechnology,\nDaejon, Korea), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nReverse transcription of the RNA was performed using\nAccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer, Daejon, Korea). One\nmicrogram of RNA and 20 pmol/ll primers were preincu-\nbated at 70 \ufffdC for 5 min and transferred to a mixture tube.\nThe reaction volume was 20 ll. cDNA synthesis was per-\nformed at 42 \ufffdC for 60 min, followed by RT inactivation\nat 94 \ufffdC for 5 min. Thereafter, the RT-generated DNA\n(2\u20135 ll) was amplified using AccuPower PCR PreMix (Bio-\nneer). The primers used for cDNA amplification and PCR\nconditions were as follows:\n\n0\nIL-8, 289 bp\n (F) 5 -ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGT\nGGCT-3 0\n(R) 5 0-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAAC\nTTCTC-3 0\nICAM-1,\n238 bp\n(F) 5 0-TATGGCAACGACTCCTTCT-3 0\n(R) 5 0-CATTCAGCGTCACCTTGG-3 0\nGAPDH,\n306 bp\n(F) 5 0-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT\nCGTAT-3 0\n(R) 5 0-AGCCTTCTCCA TGGTGGTG\nAAGAC-3 0\nIL-8; an initial denaturation at 94 \ufffdC for 5 min; 25 cycles\nat 94 \ufffdC for 30 s, at 62 \ufffdC for 30 s, and at 72 \ufffdC for 30 s,\nand ICAM-1; 30 cycles at 94 \ufffdC for 45 s, at 58 \ufffdC for\n1 min, and at 72 \ufffdC for 1 min, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase); 25 cycles at 94 \ufffdC for 30 s,\nat 62 \ufffdC for 30 s, at 72 \ufffdC for 30 s. PCR products were\nresolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium\nbromide.\n2.6. Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK MAP kinase\n\nCells were stimulated according to designated experi-\nmental protocols. Proteins were extracted with an extrac-\ntion buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, containing\n150 mM NaCl, 1% nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxy-\ncholate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovana-\ndate, 1 mM 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin,\n10 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benze-\nnesulfonyl fluoride). Activation of MAP kinase was exam-\nined by determining its phosphorylation state using the\nantibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of p38\nMAP kinase and ERK-1 and ERK-2.\n2.7. Western blot analysis\n\nProtein samples (50 lg) were mixed with an equal vol-\nume of 2\u00b7 SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then\nseparated through 8\u201315% SDS\u2013PAGE gels. After electro-\nphoresis, proteins were transferred to nylon membranes\nby electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked\nin 5% dry milk (1 h), rinsed, and incubated with primary\nantibodies (diluted at 1:500 or 1:1000) in TBS overnight\nat 4 \ufffdC. Primary antibody was then removed by washing\n\n\n\n70 H.-J.

Following three\nwashes in TBS, bands were visualized by ECL and exposed\nto X-ray film.\n\n2.8. Surface ICAM-1 expression by flow cytometry\n\nMonolayers of PDL cells were detached by incubation\nwith trypsin 0.25% and EDTA 0.25% in calcium- and mag-\nnesium-free PBS (pH 7.2). For single-label flow cytometric\nanalysis of ICAM-1 expression, 2 \u00b7 105 cells/ml were incu-\nbated for 30 min on ice with 2.5 ll of anti-human ICAM-1\nMAb in a total volume of 500 ll of PBS containing\n0.05 mM EDTA, BSA 0.1% and FBS 0.05%. After washing\ntwice, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 500 ll of\na dilution (1 in 100) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (DAKO). Cells were\nwashed twice with PBS then the immunofluorescence of\nthe FITC single label was measured with a flow cytometer\n(Beckton\u2013Dickinson, CS, USA).\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\n\nThe results were expressed as means \u00b1 SD of three inde-\npendent experiments. Statistical significances were com-\npared between each treated group and control by the\nStudent\u2019s t-test. Each experiment was repeated at least\nthree times and yielded comparable results. Values with\np < 0.05 were considered significant.\nFig. 1. Effect of TNF-a on expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein in hPDL cell\nthe time indicated (A and B).

Effect of TNF-a on expression of IL-8 mRNA and\nprotein in hPDL cells\n\nWe first determined the time course for IL-8 secretion in\nhPDL cells in response to TNF-a, as well as the optimal\nTNF-a concentration for this response. Cells were treated\nwith TNF-a, the cell culture media were harvested, and\nthe level of secreted IL-8 protein was determined by\nELISA. TNF-a-induced IL-8 secretion was found to\nsteadily increase in a time- and dose-dependent manner\n(Fig. 1A and C). Maximal induction was seen after 48 h\nof exposure to 20 ng/ml TNF-a. When the level of IL-8\nmRNA in the induced cultures was analyzed by RT-\nPCR, the increase in IL-8 protein secretion correlated with\nthe accumulation of IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 1B and D).\n\n3.2.

Treatment of cell cultures with dexamethasone\n(10\ufffd9, 10\ufffd8, and 10\ufffd7 M) significantly inhibited the induc-\ntion of IL-8 mRNA expression, protein secretion and cell\nviability by TNF-a (10 ng/ml), in a concentration-depen-\ndent manner (Fig. 2A\u2013C). In particular, treatment with\n10\ufffd7 M dexamethasone dramatically decreased levels of\nIL-8 protein, mRNA and cell viability. These results show\ns.

Degradation of IjB allows NF-jB to translocate to\nthe nucleus, bind to its specific promoter elements, and\nactivate gene transcription. Since NF-jB activation is\nimportant for the regulation of IL-8 [28], we examined\nthe effect of dexamethasone on TNF-a-induced NF-jB\nactivation. Cells were exposed to TNF-a for 15 min, cell\nlysates were prepared, and IjB degradation and phosphor-\nylation were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-IjBa\nand anti-phospho-IjBa antibodies, respectively.

Effects of p38 and ERK inhibitor on IL-8 expression in\n\ndexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cells\n\nSince our results indicated that p38 and ERK are inhib-\nited by TNF-a exposure, we next examined whether these\nMAPKs are required for induction of pro-inflammatory\ngene expression by TNF-a. Cells were pre-treated with\n20 lM SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK) or\n20 lM PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of ERK kinase) for\n1 h. They were then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-a and\n10\ufffd7 M dexamethasone for 24 h, supernatant fractions\nwere collected, and the amount of IL-8 protein secreted\nwas determined by ELISA (Fig. 5A).\n\nPre-treatment of hPDL cells with either of the selective\ninhibitors for p38 (SB203580) or ERK kinase (PD98059)\nblocked TNF-a-induced IL-8 production (Fig. 5A). As seen\nin Fig. 5B, the level of secreted IL-8 protein correlated with\nthe level of accumulated IL-8 mRNA. With dexamethasone\n(10\ufffd7 M) treatment, the inhibitory effect of pre-treatment on\nIL-8 mRNA and protein expression was also noted (Fig. 5A\nand B).

Effects of p38 and ERK inhibitor on ICAM-1 expression\n\nin dexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated hPDL cells\n\nBecause of similarities in the kinetics of induction of IL-\n8 and ICAM-1 mRNA, and in the structures of the IL-8\nand ICAM-1 gene promoters, we hypothesized that MAP-\nKs may also regulate ICAM-1 expression. Both IL-8 and\nICAM-1 mRNA were rapidly up-regulated in hPDL fol-\nlowing stimulation with TNF-a (Fig. 6A), but simulta-\nneous treatment with dexamethasone suppressed the\ninduction of ICAM-1 by TNF-a (Fig. 6A\u2013C).\n\nRT-PCR analysis indicated that pre-treatment of hPDL\ncells with SB203580 or PD98059 inhibited induction of\nICAM-1 mRNA expression by TNF-a, with or without\ndexamethasone (Fig. 6A). The effects of MAPK inhibitors\non the surface expression of ICAM-1 were also examined\nby FACS analysis. The results of the FACS analysis, which\nare shown in a conventional flow cytometric histogram on\na log scale in Fig. 6B and C, are consistent with the RT-\nPCR analysis. SB203580 inhibited TNF-a-induced surface\nexpression of ICAM-1 in the presence and absence of\ndexamethasone (Fig. 6B). PD98059 also blocked TNF-a-\ninduced surface expression of ICAM-1 in the absence of\ndexamethasone, but not in its presence (Fig. 6C). These\nresults suggest that the mechanisms by which dexametha-\nsone and TNF-a induce ICAM-1 expression do not involve\nthe tyrosine p38/ERK1/2 pathway in the same way.\n\n4.

They lose their osteoblast-like characteristics\n[29] and express genes that are associated with catabolic\nprocesses, including bone resorption, as evidenced by\nstudies on the mechanism of orthodontic tooth move-\nment [29,30].\n\nOrthodontic tooth movement activates the secretion of\nosteolytic cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a that\nare produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts\n[13,14]. IL-8, which was originally identified as a mono-\ncyte-derived factor capable of attracting and activating\nneutrophils, is increasingly being recognized as multifunc-\ntional. It appears to be important in the regulation of bone\nresorption, and its diverse functions have been investigated\nin a variety of cell types [5,6]. However, the effects of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids on IL-8 pro-\nduction in hPDL cells have not previously been studied\nin detail.\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the production and\nsecretion of IL-8 from hPDL cells that were treated with\nthe pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a in the presence\nand absence of dexamethasone. These treatments were cho-\nsen to mimic the inflammatory responses of bone resorp-\ntion during orthodontic tooth movement. IL-8 secretion\nwas significantly enhanced by treatment with TNF-a, in a\ndose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B), and\nexpression of IL-8 mRNA was also enhanced, in a time-de-\npendent manner (Fig. 1C and D). These results are in\naccordance with those of previous studies using various\nhuman cell types, including osteoclasts [8], endothelial cells\none and TNF-a stimulated PDL cells by RT-PCR (A), and FACS-analysis\n1 h, post-treated with TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and dexamethasone (10\ufffd7 M) for\nT-PCR.

Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376\n[15], and airway smooth-muscle cells [16], and they indicate\nthat TNF-a-dependent up-regulation of IL-8 is due to an\nincrease in transcription.\n\nOne characteristic feature of many cytokines is that their\nactions involve interactive networks or cascades that are\noften stimulatory. However, our present data demonstrate\nthat dexamethasone inhibits TNF-a-induced secretion of\nIL-8 (Fig. 2A and B), providing an example, therefore, of\nan equally interesting inhibitory interaction. In a previous\nstudy by Fujisawa et al. [31], dexamethasone was found\nto have no effect on TNF-a-induced IL-8 production, but\nthis lack of effect may be related to the low concentration\nof dexamethasone used. Additionally, we did not observe\na significant effect for dexamethasone at the concentration\n(10\ufffd9 M) used in their study; however, at higher concentra-\ntions (10\ufffd8 and 10\ufffd7 M), it significantly inhibited TNF-a-\ninduced IL-8 production in our study, and in those of\nRothe et al. [8], Nyhlen et al. [15], and Pang et al. [16].\nThese results suggest that dexamethasone plays a impor-\ntant role in the regulation of bone remodeling and that this\neffect is due to inhibition of TNF-a-induced IL-8 secretion\nduring orthodontic tooth movement.\n\nIL-8 production in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli\nis dependent on MAPK- and NF-jB-mediated pathways\n[32]. NF-jB comprises specific, heterodimeric complexes\nthat are inactive in the cytoplasm of resting cells, where\neach NF-jB complex is bound to one of the IjB proteins.\nStimulus-induced activation of the NF-jB-inducing kinase\ncauses it to phosphorylate the IjB kinase complexes [33].\nUbiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of\nIjB follows, freeing NF-jB to translocate to the nucleus,\nwhere it interacts with its target DNA motifs and regulates\nthe secretion of various chemokines, including IL-8 [33,34].\n\nIjB kinases are phosphorylated by NF-jB-inducing\nkinases, which activate various MAPKs, including the\nstress-activated protein kinase JNK [35]. Recently, the\nIL-6 and IL-8 genes have been identified as new targets reg-\nulated by JNK [36]. Other studies have shown that (i)\nERK1/2 and JNK play an important role in streptococcal\nprotein I/II-mediated synthesis of IL-6 and IL-8 in fibro-\nblast-like synoviocytes [37]; (ii) p38 MAPK plays a crucial\nrole in IL-6 and IL-8 production by TNF-a- or IL-1b-stim-\nulated rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts [38]; and (iii) p38\nand ERK MAPKs contribute to TNF-a-stimulated IL-8\nsecretion by intestinal epithelial cells [39].\n\nTo investigate the connection between the activation of\np38 and ERK and induction of IL-8, we evaluated the\neffects of JNK and ERK pathway inhibitors (SB203580\nand PD98059, respectively) and an anti-inflammatory\nagent (dexamethasone) on NF-jB, MAPK activation,\nand IL-8 production in hPDL cells exposed to TNF-a.\nDexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-mediated phosphoryla-\ntion of p38 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 3), indicating a possible spe-\ncific interaction with the p38/ERK1/2 signal pathway.\nMoreover, dexamethasone inhibited TNF-a-mediated IjB\ndegradation (Fig. 4) and NF-jB binding to DNA, provid-\ning evidence that dexamethasone regulates expression of\nthe pro-inflammatory target gene, IL-8, by suppressing\nthe NF-jB-activating signal pathway in hPDL cells.\n\nAlthough the importance of ERK1/2 in IL-8 expression\nhas been described in previous studies [40,41], the role of\np38 MAPK in IL-8 expression is unclear. In a study by Rid-\nley et al. [42], SB203580 had no effect on IL-8 expression in\nIL-1-stimulated human fibroblast or umbilical vein endothe-\nlial cells. On the other hand, in a study by Zu et al. [43], acti-\nvation of p38 MAPK was required for stimulation of IL-8\nproduction by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating\nfactor, lipopolysaccharide, or TNF-a in neutrophils. In the\npresent study, both the p38 inhibitor and the ERK inhibitor\nefficiently blocked IL-8 protein production in response to\nTNF-a/dexamethasone, as shown by ELISA (Fig. 5A) and\nsemi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Thus, the effect of\nstimulating agents on IL-8 regulation appears to vary with\ncell type and the particular agent used.\n\nICAM-1, a cell surface adhesion molecule, is involved in\nmany biological responses, including leukocyte adhesion to\nendothelial cells. It is expressed on several types of cells,\nincluding endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and leukocytes,\nand it is up-regulated at sites of inflammation by pro-in-\nflammatory cytokines [44\u201346]. Evidence for ICAM-1\nexpression in the PDL was reported by Toms et al. [47],\nwho used immunohistochemical analysis to examine the\neffect of endotoxin exposure on rat PDL blood vessels.\nFurthermore, Joe et al. [48] demonstrated that IL-1b causes\nup-regulation of ICAM-1 in PDL cells. However, whether\nICAM-1 functions as a signaling molecule to transmit bio-\nchemical signals in hPDL cells remains unknown. In the\npresent study using hDPL cells, we found that TNF-a\ninduces ICAM-1 expression, that dexamethasone signifi-\ncantly inhibits this response, and that this response is con-\nsistent with the effect of TNF-a on IL-8 (Fig. 6). Hence,\nthis report constitutes the first description of a signaling\nrole for ICAM-1 in hPDL cells.\n\nTransformed intestinal epithelial cells have been shown\nto express IL-8 and ICAM-1 both constitutively and upon\ntreatment with TNF-a [44,45], and p38 MAPK plays a role\nin the regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as\nIL-8, and adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 [23,46].\nThus, we examined whether MAPKs regulate ICAM-1\nexpression in dexamethasone- and TNF-a-stimulated\nhPDL cells at the level of translation or transcription.\nInterestingly, we found that SB203580 dramatically sup-\npresses ICAM-1 expression by hPDL cells exposed to\nTNF-a with or without dexamethasone, as shown by\nsemi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6A) and FACS analysis.\nPD98059 pretreatment blocked TNF-a-induced ICAM-1\nexpression, whereas did not affect ICAM-1 expression in\ncells simultaneously treated with TNF-a and dexametha-\nsone. According to Jijon et. al. [26], neither PD98059 nor\nSB203580 reduced the number of ICAM-1 molecule fol-\nlowing TNF-a treatment on the intestinal epithelium. The\nreason for this difference may reflect compensatory effect\nof dexamethasone for TNF-a, and may activate different\ntarget MAP kinase in different cell types.\n\n\n\nH.-J. Lee et al. / Cytokine 35 (2006) 67\u201376 75\nThe present study demonstrates that hPDL cells secrete\nthe potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8, and that TNF-\na exposure stimulates production of IL-8 by these cells.\nFurthermore, dexamethasone inhibits the effect of TNF-a\non IL-8 expression in these cells by blocking MAPKs and\nthe IjB/NF-jB pathway. The up- or down-regulation of\nboth ICAM-1 and IL-8 in response to TNF-a or dexameth-\nasone appears to be mediated by p38 and ERK MAPKs.\nThus, these factors may play an important role in the\nimmunoregulation of bone remodeling during orthodontic\ntooth movement. Further studies elucidating the interac-\ntions among other osteotropic factors in hDPL cells should\nlead to techniques that will facilitate effective and rapid\northodontic tooth movement.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Davidovitch Z.

In the present study, we amplified and cloned the sequence (582 bp) encoding full-length bovine\nIL-18 from PBMC stimulated with PHA. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence of Bos\nindicus IL-18 showed an identity of 86\u201398% compared with IL-18 sequences of other ruminants. The\ninsert was subcloned into a pET 32a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein and the\nmatured protein was obtained by caspase I treatment. The specificity of these proteins was confirmed\nby western blotting. The biological activity of the purified protein was analyzed by its ability to induce\nIFN-\u03b3 production in PBMC measured by ELISA and qPCR.\n\nKey words biological activity, Bos indicus, expression, interleukin (IL-18).\n\nIL-18, an enhancer of IL-12-driven Th1 immune response\nin hosts, is important in developing immunity against in-\ntracellular pathogens. IL-18 was originally termed IFN-\u03b3-\ninducing factor because of its ability to induce IFN-\u03b3 pro-\nduction by Th1 cells and NK. Besides its IFN-\u03b3-inducing\nactivity, IL-18 has been found to have other biological\nfunctions, such as stimulation of Th1 cell development,\nupregulation of GM-CSF and IL-2R\u03b1, decreased IL-10 ex-\npression in T cells and the modulation of immunoglobulin\nsecretion by B cells (1\u20135). The pro-inflammatory activity\nof IL-18 is mediated by the production of nitric oxide,\nprostaglandins (6, 7) and inflammatory cytokines, such as\nTNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. IL-18 induces chemokines (IL-8, MIP-\n1, MCP-1) and recruits monocytes and macrophages to\nthe site of infection (2, 8). IL-18 is secreted as a precursor\nmolecule of 24 kDa which gets cleaved into an 18-kDa\nmature molecule which is mediated by caspase I (6).

In the present communication, we report\nthe cloning and expression of the full-length bovine (Bos\nindicus) IL-18 cDNA in the prokaryotic system and its\nbiological activity in vitro.\n\nPBMC (5 \u00d7 106 cells) isolated from cattle (Indian\nlocal Hallikar breed, Bos indicus) by density gradient\ncentrifugation using Histopaque 1.077 (Sigma India,\nBangalore, India) grown in RPMI-1640 medium were\nstimulated with PHA (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 16 hr. Total RNA\nwas extracted from stimulated cells using TRIZOL reagent\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcription was\ncarried out using an oligo dT primer. cDNA was used\nto amplify the bovine IL-18 sequence using IL-18L (5\u2032\n\nGGCGGAATTCATGGCTGCAGAACAAGT AGA 3\u2032) and\nreverse IL-18-R (5\u2032 GGCGGCG GCCGCCTAGTTCTG-\nGTTTTGAACAGT 3\u2032) primers designed using the IL-18\nsequence of Bos taurus (Accession No. EU276078).

The nucleotide and\nthe deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned gene was\naligned with the sequences of different species of domes-\ntic animals and humans (available in the public database)\nusing the Meg Align (DNASTAR version 1.82) program\nand phylogenetic analysis was carried out using MEGA\nversion 2.1 (13).\n\nThe IL-18 sequence was subcloned into a pET 32a vec-\ntor (Novagen USA) at EcoRI and NotI sites (pET-bo-IL18).\nThe pET-IL18 plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain\nBL-21(DE3) PLys for protein expression. Cells were grown\n37\u25e6C to OD600 = 0.8 and the expression was induced with\n1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for\n4 hr at 30\u25e6C. Bacterial lysate was used for SDS-PAGE anal-\nysis under denaturing conditions to visualize the protein\nband. Histidine-tagged fusion protein was purified on a\nnickel-chelating agarose affinity column according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions under denaturing conditions\n(Invitrogen). Purified IL-18 was renatured by dialysis and\nthe endotoxin was removed by treating with Triton X 114\nusing a two-phase extraction method (14) and the endo-\ntoxin quantity was measured by Limulus amebocyte lysate\nassay kit (LAL; Biocompare, Kidlington, UK). The puri-\nfied proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western\nblotting using anti-human mAb (2 \u03bcg/ml; R&D Systems,\nMinneapolis, MN). The purified protein was treated with\n1 U/20 ng protein human recombinant caspase I (Biovi-\nsion, Mountain View, CA). The digested protein was used\nfor measurement of biological activity.\n\nThe induction of IFN-\u03b3 from PBMC by IL-18 protein\nwas used as an assay for IL-18 biological activity. Ini-\ntially, the dose of IL-18 required for optimal stimulation\nof PBMC was determined by using various doses (50\u2013\n400 ng) and the 200 ng dose was found to be optimal.\nPBMC isolated from cattle were stimulated with recombi-\nnant IL-18 protein (200 ng/ml) and IFN-\u03b3 gene expression\nin PBMC was then measured by real-time PCR. Total RNA\nextracted from PBMC using TRIZOL was used to synthe-\nsize cDNA using an oligo dT primer. PCR reaction mixture\ncontained 1\u00d7 SYBR green reaction mix (Applied Biosys-\ntems Carlsbad, CA) and 300 nm of both IFN-\u03b3-specific\nprimers IFN-L (5\u2032 tggatatcatcaagcaagacatgtt 3\u2032) and IFN-\nR (5\u2032 aggtcattcatcactttgatgagttcat 3\u2032). Real-time PCR was\ncarried out using the ABI prism 7300 (Applied Biosys-\ntems) with conditions consisting of an initial step at 50\u25e6C\nfor 2 min and 95\u25e6C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 95\u25e6C\nfor 15 s and at 60\u25e6C for 1 min. The transcribed RNA from\nthe plasmid pcDNA-IFN-\u03b3 (containing full sequence of\nbovine IFN-\u03b3) was used in the standard curve. The IFN-\n\n\u03b3-RNA copy number was calculated from the quantified\nRNA (optic density at 260 nm) and serial dilutions of RNA\n(with 1 \u00d7 102 to 1 \u00d7 107 copies of RNA) were used for\nstandard curve preparation.\n\nProduction of IFN-\u03b3 by bovine whole blood stimu-\nlated with bovine recombinant IL-18 was carried out us-\ning a bovine IFN-\u03b3 ELISA kit (Mabtech, Nacka Strand,\nSweden) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions\n(15). Heparinized whole blood was incubated with\n200 ng/ml purified IL18 in a six-well plate for 24 hr at 37\u25e6C\nin a CO2 incubator. The plate was centrifuged at 800 \u00d7g\nfor 10 min at 4\u25e6C. Supernatant (100 \u03bcl) was pipetted out\nfrom each well into a new 96-well plate. IFN-\u03b3 standard\nknown amounts in duplicate were included and the quan-\ntity of IFN-\u03b3 in the unknown samples was estimated from\nthe standard curve obtained from the known standards.\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.\n\nBovine IL-18 has an open reading frame of 582 bp\nencoding a protein of 193 amino acids with a predicted\nmolecular weight of 24 kDa. The sequence alignment\nshowed that bovine precursor IL-18 also has a signal pep-\ntide of 35 amino acids at the N-terminal followed by a ma-\nture peptide of 157 amino acids. Bovine IL-18 has high se-\nquence homology with that of other ruminants, as it shares\n94% and 92% amino acid identity with IL-18 of bubaline\nand nilgai, respectively (AC NO-AY401033, AY842499). It\nwas shown to have 91%, 90%, 85% and 82% amino acid\nidentity with carpine, ovine, porcine and equine IL-18 se-\nquences, respectively (AY605263, AJ401033, U68701.1).\nHowever, it shares approximately 76\u201378% amino acid\nidentity with human, fox, feline, and canine proteins\n(BC007461, EF581884, AB056857, Y11133). Phylogenetic\nanalysis of the nucleotide sequences of IL-18 of different\nspecies of domestic animals is presented as an unrooted\ntree (Fig. 1). As is evident from the tree, IL-18 sequences\nof ovine, nilgai and buffalo are clustered together and are\ndistinct from other species, including humans. Sequence\ncomparison of IL-18 of Bos indicus with that of other\nspecies showed that Glu42 and Lys89 are conserved in\nall the species in which sequences were compared. These\nconserved amino acids are shown to be critical to binding\n\nFig. 1.

Deletion\nmutants of IL-18 at Glu42 and Lys89 have lost their bi-\nological activity (16). Structure analysis of human IL-18\nhas revealed that three sites are important for receptor\nbinding. From the aligned sequences, it was observed that\nthe residues forming these critical sites were nearly well\nconserved in all the domestic animals. They include R49,\nD53, M69, D71 and D168, which form site I; K40, L41,\nK44, R94 and R140, which form site II; and 115K, 120K\nand D134, which form site III.\n\nBovine IL-18 insert was subcloned into a pET 32a vec-\ntor, transformed into BL-21 (DE3) PLys cells and the\nexpression of the gene was induced by IPTG. An addi-\ntional band of 42 kDa was observed in cases where lysate\nfrom induced bacteria corresponded to the IL-18 fusion\nprotein. Histidine-tagged protein was purified from the\nlysates by a nickel column. Precursor IL-18 undergoes\nproteolytic cleavage by IL-1\u03b2 converting enzyme to gener-\nate a mature bioactive 18 kDa molecule. We expressed the\nIL-18 in soluble form and purified the protein by a nickel-\nnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column. Purified IL-18 was\nrenatured by dialysis and the endotoxin was removed by\ntreating with Triton-X114 and the endotoxin content in\nthe purified product was found to be 0.09 EU/\u03bcg pro-\ntein (endotoxin unit). The fusion protein of 42 kDa was\nexpressed initially and the 18 kDa matured protein was\nobtained after caspase I. Fusion protein from the crude\nlysate, purified protein and the mature protein reacted\nwith IL-18 anti-human monoclonal antibodies in an im-\nmunoblot assay (Fig. 2a,b). As IL-18 is a potent inducer\nof IFN-\u03b3, we studied the level of IFN-\u03b3-specific mRNA\n\nFig. 2. (a) Immunoblotting of recombinant bovine precursor IL-\n18.

However, it is largely unknown whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMVs can\nactivate inflammatory responses and whether immunization with OMVs can provide immune protection against subsequent\ninfection. We purified and identified OMVs, which were then used to infect lung epithelial cells in vitro as well as C57BL/6J mice\nto investigate the immune response and the underlying signaling pathway. The results showed that OMVs generated from P.\naeruginosa wild-type strain PAO1 were more cytotoxic to alveolar epithelial cells than those from quorum-sensing (QS)-defi-\ncient strain PAO1-\ufffdlasR. The levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\ufffd\n(IL-1\ufffd) and IL-6, increased following OMV infection. Compared with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysed OMVs in which the mem-\nbrane structures were broken induced a weak immune response. Furthermore, expression levels of TLR4-mediated responders\n(i.e., cytokines) were markedly downregulated by the TLR4 inhibitor E5564. Active immunization with OMVs or passive transfer\nof sera with a high cytokine quantity acquired from OMV-immunized mice could protect healthy mice against subsequent lethal\nPAO1 challenges (1.5 \ufffd 1011 CFU). Collectively, these findings indicate that naturally secreted P. aeruginosa OMVs may trigger\nsignificant inflammatory responses via the TLR4 signaling pathway and protect mice against pseudomonal lung infection.\n\nSince 1990, lung infections exceeded HIV/AIDS, cancer, andheart diseases and became the greatest cause of disease world-\nwide (1). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic\npathogen, can cause infections in multiple organ systems, and is\nextremely invasive in immunocompromised patients with cystic\nfibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchiecta-\nsis (2\u20134). Like other Gram-negative bacteria, P. aeruginosa can\nsecrete outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a potential means to\ndeliver virulence factors to distant locations by fusing with lipid\nrafts on the host cell membrane (5\u20137). This has led to growing\nresearch interest in the pathogenesis of OMVs in the past few\nyears.\n\nThe origination of bacterial OMVs was considered a general\nenvelope stress response (8, 9). Natural OMVs are composed of\nouter membrane and periplasmic constituents, including phos-\npholipids, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and proteins as well as sev-\neral virulence factors (10\u201313). LPS can be sensed by Toll-like re-\nceptor 4 (TLR4) on host cells to mount an innate immune\nresponse to Gram-negative bacteria (14, 15). Some LPS can cause\nTLR2-mediated signaling in human cells, which may be attributed\nto the structural difference from the typical hexa-acyl bisphos-\nphorylated format of TLR4-activatable LPS (16, 17). Proteins\nwithin P. aeruginosa secreted vesicles have also been reported to\nplay an important role during infection. Typically, vesicles con-\ntaining cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\n(CFTR)-inhibitory factor (Cif) can reduce chloride secretion by\ndecreasing the apical expression of CFTR and thereby reducing\nthe mucociliary clearance of pathogens (18, 19).\n\nPrevious research reported that OMVs could elicit heightened\ninnate immune responses by the combined sensing of both LPS\nand protein components (14, 20\u201322). OMVs were shown to be\n\npromising for development of vaccines against infection by the\ncorresponding bacteria (21\u201327). Remarkably, vaccines developed\nbased on Neisseria lactamica OMVs were shown to render effective\nprotection against meningococcal infection and underwent a\nphase I clinical trial for safety and immunogenicity studies with\nadult volunteers (27, 28). OMVs from P. aeruginosa were also\nfound to trigger the production of cytokines in epithelial cells and\nmacrophages (20, 29). These findings suggest that naturally pro-\nduced P. aeruginosa vesicles have the potential to protect the im-\nmunized host against subsequent pseudomonal infection. How-\never, to date, P. aeruginosa OMVs have not been tested for\nimmunization as a vaccine candidate. Hence, in this study, we first\ninvestigated the possibility that OMVs might activate the intercel-\nlular immune response via the TLR4 signaling pathway and then\nexplored the immune protection of OMVs based on a mouse\nmodel. Importantly, P. aeruginosa OMVs were shown to be capa-\nble of protecting immunized mice from lethal challenges with var-\nious concentrations of P. aeruginosa.\n\nReceived 13 August 2013 Returned for modification 6 September 2013\nAccepted 20 September 2013\n\nPublished ahead of print 30 September 2013\n\nEditor: B.

The Pseu-\ndomonas aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type (WT) strain and quorum-sensing\n(QS) defective strain PAO1-\ufffdlasR were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth\nmedium. OMVs produced by WT PAO1 and PAO1-\ufffdlasR were purified by\nusing a differential centrifugation and discontinuous Optiprep (Sigma-\nAldrich) gradient protocol adapted and modified from a protocol de-\nscribed previously by Bauman and Kuehn (29). Briefly, 500 ml of P.\naeruginosa cells was grown to the early stationary phase, and bacterial cells\nwere removed by pelleting at 4\u00b0C (10,000 \ufffd g for 10 min). Supernatants\nwere concentrated via a 100-kDa tangential filtration concentration unit\n(Pall-Gellman), and the retentate was centrifuged and filtered through a\n0.45-\ufffdm-pore-size Durapore polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore).\nVesicles were pelleted (50,000 \ufffd g for 1 h), resuspended in a discontinu-\nous Optiprep gradient, and centrifuged (100,000 \ufffd g for 16 h) again. Pure\nvesicles were recovered from pooled peak fractions by dilution in HEPES\nand pelleting (150,000 \ufffd g for 1 h). Pure vesicles were diluted in phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) before use. The components of\nOMVs were visualized by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie blue staining.\n\nCell culture. A549 human lung epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-185) and\nMLE-12 murine lung epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-2110) were obtained\nfrom the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used to examine\nimmune responses induced by the OMVs. A549 cells were grown in Dul-\nbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine\nserum plus penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Fungizone) (Invit-\nrogen, CA). Mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S cells (ATCC CRL-2019)\nwere also obtained from the ATCC and were maintained in RPMI\u2013F-12\nmedium (50%:50%) and 2 mM HEPES buffer.\n\nThe innate immune responses of A549 and MLE-12 cells were stud-\nied in the presence of OMVs (0.25 mg/ml) or LPS (Sigma-Aldrich)\nfrom P. aeruginosa (100 ng/ml) or lysed OMVs (0.25 mg/ml), followed\nby incubation until the time of assay. Cells were harvested at desig-\nnated time points and lysed in chilled radioimmunoprecipitation assay\n(RIPA) buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl,\n1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na deoxycholate). OMVs were\nlysed with EDTA (100 mM) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min as described previously\nby Bomberger et al. (6).\n\nCytotoxicity assay. To determine the strain-specific cytotoxicity of P.\naeruginosa OMVs on A549 and MLE-12 cells, confluent cells were har-\nvested and seeded into wells of 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 \ufffd 104\n\ncells/well. Purified vesicles (0.25 mg/ml) of PAO1 or PAO1-\ufffdlasR or PBS\n(10 \ufffdl each) was added to each well and incubated for the indicated time\npoints. Subsequently, cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the\ncellular 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide\n(MTT; Promega) reduction activity according to the method of Abe and\nMatsuki (30). Briefly, MTT was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 2.5\nmg/ml (6 mM) and added to each well so that the final concentration of\nMTT in the medium was 0.25 mg/ml (600 \ufffdM), and the cells were then\nincubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 \ufffdl of a\nsolution containing 50% dimethylformamide and 20% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate (DMF-SDS) (pH 4.7). After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, the\noptical density (OD) was read on a microplate reader at a test wavelength\nof 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 655 nm. The results were calcu-\nlated as the ratio of the mean OD value of experimental groups to that of\nthe control group treated with PBS.\n\nProinflammatory responses in mouse models. We studied the im-\nmune response against P. aeruginosa OMVs in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were\nobtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and housed in the animal facility\nat the University of North Dakota. The animal experiments were ap-\nproved and performed in accordance with institutional animal care and\nuse committee guidelines (University of North Dakota Institutional Ani-\nmal Care and Use Committee [IACUC] approval number 1204-4). Mice\nwere lightly anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of\nketamine HCl (30 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine HCl (15 mg/kg)\n\n(Sigma). Mouse lungs were aseptically removed at 12 h and 24 h after\nintranasal instillation of 0.5 mg purified P. aeruginosa OMVs. The lungs\nwere homogenized by the use of a Branson SLPe digital sonifier cell dis-\nruptor (Fisher Scientific) in chilled RIPA buffer. The homogenate was\ncentrifuged at 20,000 \ufffd g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris.\n\nInhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway. To confirm the result that\nP. aeruginosa OMVs could trigger the intracellular inflammatory response via\nthe TLR4 signaling pathway, we used E5564 [\ufffd-D-glucopyranose,3-O-decyl-\n2-deoxy-6-O-[2-deoxy-3-O-[(3R)-3-methoxydecyl]-6-O-methyl-2-\n[[(11Z)-1-oxo-11-octadecenyl]amino]-4-O-phosphono-\ufffd-D-\nglucopyranosyl]-2-[(1,3-dioxotetradecyl)amino]-1-(dihydrogen\nphosphate),tetrasodium salt] (formula weight, 1,401.60), a TLR4-directed\nendotoxin antagonist (31) synthesized by Eisai Research Institute of Boston\n(Andover, MA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MLE-12 cells\nwere seeded in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37\u00b0C.\nThe next day, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of E5564\n(1 nM and 10 nM) in the presence of P. aeruginosa OMVs at a concentration\nof 0.25 mg/ml for 24 h. Cells treated with same amount of PBS were used as a\ncontrol group. Cells treated with LPS at a concentrations of 100 ng/ml and 10\nnM E5564 were used as a control for E5564. Cells were harvested and lysed in\nchilled RIPA buffer.\n\nImmunization of mice. To explore the immunoprotective potential\nof P. aeruginosa-derived OMVs, 0.5 mg purified PAO1 OMVs were intra-\nnasally instilled into anesthetized C57BL/6J mice on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21,\nand 28. At day 29, sera of immunized mice were collected and preserved at\n\ufffd80\u00b0C. Other groups of immunized mice (5 mice for each group) were\nthen intranasally challenged with P. aeruginosa. To test the protective roles\nof OMV immunization, two challenge doses were then chosen, a dose\n(1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU) sufficient to induce 100% mortality in the absence of\nimmunization and a dose approximately 100 times (1.5 \ufffd 1011 CFU)\nhigher than that. For controls, untreated mice or mice intranasally inoc-\nulated with a single dose of OMVs were also challenged with the same\namount of P. aeruginosa. To test the passive immunity transfer, vesicle-\nimmunized sera with abundant cytokines were diluted into series of con-\ncentrations (5-, 10-, 20-, and 50-fold) and were subcutaneously injected\ninto C57BL/6J mice. Each mouse received 0.2 ml diluted serum by subcu-\ntaneous injection. The next day, serum-injected mice were challenged by\nintranasal instillation of the above-mentioned two concentrations of P.\naeruginosa. Mice subcutaneously injected with either unimmunized sera\nor the sera immunized with a single dose of OMVs were challenged with\nthe same amount of P. aeruginosa as controls. The clinical onset of chal-\nlenged mice was assessed, from reduced activity, fatigue, lethargy, and\nmessy furs to extremely sick (moribund), which was considered dead on\nthat day, and observation was terminated after 10 days. For each experi-\nment, mice injected with the same amount of PBS were also used as a\ncontrol.\n\nWestern blotting.

Mouse monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was purchased from Cell Signal-\ning Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibod-\nies were purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals. Western blotting\nwas carried out as described previously (32).

Lungs of WT and immunized mouse after a 12-h P. aeruginosa\nchallenge were lavaged 5 times by instilling and withdrawing 1 ml of PBS\nwith an aseptic syringe. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples\nwere collected, mixed to ensure an even suspension, and then stained with\nHEMA-3 (Fisher, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. Subsequently, 10 \ufffdl of the mixture was pipetted into the wells of a\nhemocytometer for cell differential counting using a light microscope.\nAfter bronchoalveolar lavage procedures, the lungs of WT and OMV-\nimmunized mice were aseptically harvested and fixed in 10% formalin.\nThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared on a rotary micro-\ntome and stained with hematoxylin-eosin by using standard techniques\n(33). All sections were examined by light microscopy. To assess bacterial\ndeposition, 1 g lungs or spleens was homogenized in liquid nitrogen,\nfollowed by a brief sonication. Homogenized tissues were fixed in PBS and\nspread onto LB plates for quantitative bacterial culture. Triplicates were\ndone for each sample and control.\n\nQuantitative PCR.

Mouse lungs were collected after challenge with 0.5 mg PAO1\nOMVs for 12 and 24 h. Lungs were lysed and quantitated, and the lysates\nwere ultrasonically disrupted. Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol\nreagent, followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR using a\nQiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s in-\nstructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cytokine protein production\n(tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\ufffd], IL-1\ufffd, and IL-6) in the serum of\nOMV-challenged mice was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosor-\nbent assay (ELISA), using ELISA kits (eBioscience Co., San Diego, CA)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

To visualize the phagocytosis of\nmurine alveolar macrophages toward P. aeruginosa OMVs, 0.1 \ufffd 106 MH-S\nalveolar macrophages were seeded overnight on collagen-coated, glass-bot-\ntom MatTek dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and then exposed to labeled\nvesicles for 5 min and 15 min.

The density of the Western blot bands\nwas determined by using ImageJ software. Data and statistical tests were\ncomputed by using Graphpad Prism version 5.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA).\nMeans were compared by using Student\u2019s t test or one-way analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA), followed by a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test using a 95% con-\nfidence interval.

A chi-square test with Yates\u2019 correction was used to compare the\nsurvival rates between immunized mice and the unimmunized group.\n\nRESULTS\nOMVs generated from P. aeruginosa PAO1 or PAO1-\ufffdlasR\nwere cytotoxic to epithelial cells. In order to study the pathogenic\nrole of OMVs, we used a protocol established previously by Bau-\nman and Kuehn (29) to purify and characterize OMVs. To ac-\ncount for the impact of pathogenic factors on immunogenicity, we\nisolated OMVs from P. aeruginosa WT strain PAO1 and a quo-\nrum-sensing-deficient strain, PAO1-\ufffdlasR. SDS-PAGE results\nshowed that the components of the two purified OMVs were al-\nmost identical, except for a band corresponding to the known\nmolecular mass of OprD (48 kDa), as also previously reported by\nBauman and Kuehn (29), in the low-density fractions of PAO1\nOMVs (Fig. 1A and B). To test the cytotoxic effect of the naturally\nsecreted OMVs, we employed human alveolar epithelial A549 cells\nand murine alveolar epithelial MLE-12 cells, as both cell types are\nmodels commonly used in culture to test host-pathogen interac-\ntions (35, 36). OMVs derived from either PAO1 or PAO1-\ufffdlasR\nwere cytotoxic to both A549 and MLE-12 cells after a delay of 8 h\nof incubation (Fig. 1C and D). These results were consistent with\ndata reported previously by Bomberger et al. (6), showing that the\nP. aeruginosa-produced OMVs were capable of causing cytotoxic-\nity on epithelial cells. Moreover, it seemed that the OMVs from\nPAO1 were more cytotoxic to A549 cells than those from PAO1-\n\ufffdlasR after 10 h of treatment (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we chose WT P.\naeruginosa for the following experiments, which might elicit vig-\norous cellular proinflammatory responses.\n\nP. aeruginosa OMVs triggered proinflammatory responses\nin vitro and in vivo via the TLR4 signaling pathway. To deter-\nmine the innate immune response induced by P. aeruginosa\nOMVs, we first detected the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 after\nchallenging respiratory epithelial cells with LPS and OMVs, re-\nspectively. We noted that the expression of TLR4 (but not TLR2)\nincreased significantly in A549 cells with challenge of OMVs or\nLPS from P. aeruginosa (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).\nThese findings suggested that the purified OMVs could induce\ninnate immune responses via the TLR4 signaling pathway, which\nmight be attributed to the properties of LPS. To further test this\nhypothesis, we evaluated several signaling proteins associated with\nthe TLR4 pathway using Western blotting. As expected, we found\nthat the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-\ufffdB increased\nin both A549 and MLE-12 cells after incubation with P. aeruginosa\nOMVs for 24 h, and the level of IL-1\ufffd was increased in MLE-12\ncells (Fig. 2A to D). However, no significant difference in the ex-\npression levels of TRIF and IRF-3 was observed (see Fig. S2 in the\nsupplemental material). These results indicated that an OMV\ncomplex of P. aeruginosa might be required to elicit a vigorous\nimmune response in epithelial cells in vitro via a MyD88-depen-\ndent TLR4 signaling pathway. Since E5564 is a widely used TLR4-\ndirected endotoxin antagonist (31), we set up to confirm the P.\naeruginosa OMV-induced TLR4 signaling pathway with E5564 to\nexamine the impact when blocking TLR4. The expression of\nTLR4-related signaling proteins, such as MyD88, NF-\ufffdB, and IL-\n\nTABLE 1 Primers for quantitative PCR used in this studya\n\nGene assayed Primer sequence\n\nIL-1\ufffd 5=-TCATTGTGGCTGTGGAGAAG-3= (forward)\n5=-CATCTCGGAGCCTGTAGTGC-3= (reverse)\n\nIL-6 5=-CTTGGGACTGATGCTGGTGA-3= (forward)\n5=-CATTTCCACGATTTCCCAGA-3= (reverse)\n\nGAPDH 5=-CTGCCCAGAACATCATCCCT-3= (forward)\n5=-TGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACC-3= (reverse)\n\na These primers were designed in this study.\n\nOMVs Modulate Host Immune Responses via TLR4 Signaling\n\nDecember 2013 Volume 81 Number 12 iai.asm.org 4511\n\nRE\nTR\n\nAC\nTE\n\nD \n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\nhttp://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/\nhttp://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\n1\ufffd, was abolished by incubation with 10 nM E5564 for 24 h com-\npared with sham controls. Indeed, blocking of TLR4 led MLE-12\ncells to fail to respond against the challenge of P. aeruginosa OMVs\n(Fig. 2E and F). To further determine the downstream factors of\nthe OMV-induced immune response, we explored the OMV-elic-\nited signaling pathway using mouse models. After intranasally\nchallenging C57BL/6J mice with OMVs 6 times, as described in\nMaterials and Methods, we determined the levels of production of\nTLR4, TIRAP, and NF-\ufffdB, which increased 1.5- to 4-fold at 12 and\n24 h in comparison with the sham-treated mice (Fig. 3). These\ndata were consistent with data reported previously by Lee et al.\nconcerning the OMVs of Escherichia coli (21). Due to the consis-\ntent observations from both in vitro and in vivo studies, we con-\nclude that P. aeruginosa OMVs could efficiently stimulate the re-\nlease of inflammatory mediators in the mouse model and that the\nimmune response might be dependent on the TLR4 pathway.\n\nThese studies prompted us to surmise that the activation of\nimmune responses was attributed primarily to the existence of\nLPS rather than intracellular virulence factors within OMVs. To\ntest our hypothesis, OMVs were lysed with 100 mM EDTA and\nthen used to stimulate A549 and MLE-12 cells in parallel with LPS.\nInterestingly, in contrast to LPS, the production of cytokines such\nas IL-1\ufffd and IL-6 was impaired by lysed OMVs (Fig. 4), suggesting\nthat the development of cellular proinflammatory responses re-\nquires intact OMVs. Furthermore, we also found that there were\nDNA species by agarose electrophoresis (data not shown), using\nthe boiled vesicles generated from both P. aeruginosa strains,\n\nwhich is consistent with studies reported previously by Renelli et\nal. (37). A large body of literature reported that the presence of the\nCpG motif in bacterial DNA could be recognized by TLR9 to\ntrigger inflammatory responses (37\u201340). Thus, we evaluated the\ninduction of TLR9 using OMV-derived DNA and OMV lysates.\nHowever, no significant changes in TLR9 expression and cytokine\nproduction were observed by using various concentrations of\nDNA and OMV lysates (data not shown), and the function of\nOMV-associated DNA remains unknown (53).\n\nProtective roles of P. aeruginosa OMVs against experimental\ninfection with P. aeruginosa. To further characterize the immune\nproperties of the isolated OMVs, we next tested the hypothesis\nthat P. aeruginosa OMV-induced serum could protect rodents\nfrom subsequent infection by P. aeruginosa strains. First, sera of P.\naeruginosa OMV-challenged mice were collected to measure the\ninflammatory cytokine levels. We found that the concentrations\nof TNF-\ufffd, IL-1\ufffd, and IL-6 increased significantly at 24 h after the\nlast OMV challenge (Fig. 5). As shown in Table 2, P. aeruginosa\nOMV-immunized C57BL/6J mice (5 per group) survived until the\nend of the experiments after challenge with P. aeruginosa at a lethal\nconcentration (1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU) and even at concentrations 100-\nfold higher than this dose. The progression of infection in unim-\nmunized mice or mice immunized with a single dose of OMVs was\nrapid, with no survivors at 24 h postchallenge, whereas mice im-\nmunized with OMVs 6 times survived the bacterial challenges.\nThese results indicate that P. aeruginosa OMVs could efficiently\nstimulate the release of inflammatory factors in mouse models to\n\nFIG 1 P. aeruginosa PAO1- and PAO1-\ufffdlasR-generated OMVs elicited time-dependent cytotoxicity in lung epithelial cells.

More-\nover, the immunized mice significantly eliminated invading bac-\nteria and recruited neutrophils and macrophages to the lungs\nagainst P. aeruginosa challenge compared to unimmunized con-\ntrol mice (Fig. 6). To evaluate the mechanism of immune protec-\ntion, we attempted to determine the protective potential of OMVs\nin naive mice by a passive immunity transfer of the sera of OMV-\nimmunized mice. The serum of an individual mouse with high-\nlevel cytokine production was then serially diluted and injected\ninto C57BL/6J mice subcutaneously. We found that serum-vacci-\nnated mice were protected from P. aeruginosa challenges with var-\nious CFU. After the serum vaccination, mice were again chal-\nlenged with a lethal dose (1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU) of P. aeruginosa and\n\nwere completely protected from death versus the control mice\nthat received sham treatments (PBS, unimmunized serum, or\nserum from mice immunized with a single dose of OMVs). We\nthen increased the amount of P. aeruginosa to 1.5 \ufffd 1011 CFU\nto further assess the protection efficacy. Mice were also com-\npletely protected by the serum, which was diluted 5- and 10-\nfold. However, for the mice that received serum that was di-\nluted 20-fold, 1 mouse out of 5 mice died. In contrast, control\nmice that received unimmunized serum and serum from mice\nimmunized with only one dose of OMVs were all dead after\nchallenge with either concentration of P. aeruginosa (Table 3).\nTherefore, P. aeruginosa-generated OMVs may be capable of\nprotecting mice from P. aeruginosa lung infection.\n\nFIG 2 P. aeruginosa OMVs trigger intracellular inflammatory responses via the TLR4 signaling pathway.

Despite\n\nintense interest, the precise role of OMVs in inducing host patho-\nphysiology remains to be fully determined, and P. aeruginosa\nOMVs have not been tested for immunizing potency and vaccine\npurposes. The current study demonstrated for the first time that P.\n\nFIG 3 P. aeruginosa PAO1-generated OMVs increase the expression levels of TLR4 pathway immunogenically related proteins, including TLR4, TIRAP, NF-\ufffdB,\nIL-1\ufffd, and IL-6, in C57BL/6J mouse lungs, as determined by Western blotting (A and B) and quantitative PCR (C).

Bauman and Kuehn found previously that the aminopeptidase\nPaAP (PA2939) or PepB was highly enriched in vesicles generated\nfrom a cystic fibrosis (CF) isolate (29). P. aeruginosa possesses two\nhierarchically superimposed and well-characterized QS systems,\nlas and rhl, controlling the synthesis and secretion of a number of\nvirulence factors during infection. Especially, the existence of the\nQS molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone in OMVs sug-\ngested that the QS system might be implicated in the packaging of\nOMVs (13, 41). In this study, the difference between the OMVs\ngenerated by PAO1 and those generated by PAO1-\ufffdlasR was an-\nalyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the components were almost identical\nexcept for a band of approximately 48 kDa, which might be OprD\nin PAO1 OMVs (Fig. 1A). Previously, porin was shown to be\nrelated to imipenem and carbapenem resistance (42, 43). It is cur-\nrently unclear why the vesicles from WT PAO1 caused more cy-\ntotoxicity to alveolar epithelial cells than did those from PAO1-\n\ufffdlasR (Fig. 1C). It is likely that additional virulence factors in\nOMVs have yet to be identified. In addition, complicated bacterial\nvirulence factors, including unannotated proteins, may be re-\nsponsible for environmental stresses and can also influence the\noutcome of infection (44). Nevertheless, our results suggested\n\nthat the QS system might be involved in the process of OMV\npackaging.\n\nWhole bacterial organisms can activate TLR4 signaling and\ninitiate vigorous immune responses, including phagocytosis and\ncytokine production, following P. aeruginosa infection, while\nTLR2 may have different immune functions (45\u201347). The litera-\nture also showed that OMVs generated from a wide range of bac-\nteria can elicit the production of various cytokines by epithelial\ncells (48, 49). In Neisseria meningitides, LPS acts as an adjuvant to\nthe components of vesicles and can profoundly modulate inflam-\nmatory responses of macrophages in a TLR4-dependent manner\n(21, 22, 25). The current study provided a detailed in vitro and in\nvivo mechanism for the stimulation of proinflammatory media-\ntors by P. aeruginosa OMVs that was TLR4 dependent (Fig. 2 and\n3). The OMV-triggered signaling pathway observed was essen-\ntially the same as purified P. aeruginosa LPS (Fig. 2 and 4). Inter-\nestingly, no significant difference was observed for the production\nof immune mediators triggered by PAO1 OMVs and PAO1-\ufffdlasR\n(Fig. 2), indicating that although QS might be associated with the\npackaging and cytotoxicity of OMVs, this master QS regulator\nmay not be a key factor for activating proinflammatory responses.\nOur previous study indicated that P. aeruginosa infection was de-\npendent on lipid raft-mediated membrane signals (50). Bomb-\nerger et al. also found that OMV virulence factors were delivered\ninto the host cell cytoplasm by fusing with lipid rafts (6). As shown\nby our confocal microcopy results, vesicles were initially colocal-\nized with lipid raft microdomains on the cell surface and then\nrapidly internalized into the cytoplasm (see Fig. S3 in the supple-\nmental material). When the lysed OMVs of P. aeruginosa were\nincubated with A549 and MLE-12 cells, the expression levels of\ncytokines, particularly IL-1\ufffd, decreased significantly (Fig. 4).\nHowever, the changes in expression levels of MyD88, NF-\ufffdB, and\nIL-6 were less prominent. Although there was also some residual\nLPS, the OMVs with lysed membranes could not efficiently acti-\nvate immune responses. In addition to the significantly increased\nlevel of production of TLR4-mediated responders elicited by in-\ntact OMVs (Fig. 2), we reasoned that the OMVs lacking an intact\nmembrane may have lost the ability to target lipid rafts, which in\nturn prevents the vesicle components from being delivered into\nthe cytoplasm to induce the production of proinflammatory fac-\ntors.

Vaccines that effectively prevent P. aeruginosa\npulmonary infections could be very useful, and previous studies\nsuggested that LPS is an influential effector in the development of\nvaccines in mice (20\u201322, 51). Ramphal et al. also showed that\nPseudomonas LPS is not a key virulence factor in acute pneumonia\nand thus can be used as an adjuvant to trigger a prominent proin-\nflammatory response and effectively defend the lung from P.\naeruginosa infection (52). Thus, in this study, we immunized mice\nwith a series of intranasal challenges to evaluate the vaccine po-\ntential of OMVs against pseudomonal lung infection. We found\n\nthat P. aeruginosa OMVs almost fully protected mice against P.\naeruginosa challenge at 1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU and even at a 100-fold-\nhigher concentration of this inoculum. All the OMV-immunized\nmice survived after challenge with a lethal concentration of P.\naeruginosa (Table 2). Additionally, the sera of OMV-immunized\nmice contained increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines\n(Fig. 5) and could also be passively transferred to protect other\nmice from death against subsequent P. aeruginosa challenges (Ta-\nble 3). Currently, the detailed mechanism for OMVs in inducing\nenhanced immunity remains to be fully determined. As our study\nis the first to clearly reveal the immune protective effect of P.\naeruginosa OMVs, further mechanistic studies of their immuniza-\ntion potential might facilitate the development of more efficient\nand broadly protective vaccines for pseudomonal diseases.\n\nFIG 6 Bacterial burden and BALF cell counts following P. aeruginosa challenge. WT and OMV-immunized mice were exposed to P. aeruginosa (1.5 \ufffd 109 CFU).\n(A) Lungs and spleens were harvested at 12 h and 7 days to enumerate invading bacteria, while all WT mice were dead at 24 h. (B to D) BALF was harvested at\n12 h for counting neutrophils (B) and macrophages (C), while lungs were collected for evaluation of histology alteration (D). Data are representative of two\nexperiments and are presented as means \t SEM (*, P \n 0.05; ***, P \n 0.001 [determined by Student\u2019s t test]).\n\nZhao et al.\n\n4516 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nRE\nTR\n\nAC\nTE\n\nD \n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\nIn summary, the data presented here demonstrated that natu-\nrally secreted OMVs of P. aeruginosa were cytotoxic to alveolar\nepithelial cells. P. aeruginosa-generated OMVs also efficiently\nstimulated the release of murine inflammatory factors via the\nTLR4 signaling pathway requiring LPS. Importantly, P. aeruginosa\nOMVs were confirmed to be capable of protecting immunized\nmice from a subsequent lethal P. aeruginosa challenge. Unlike P.\naeruginosa, OMVs had a significantly reduced virulence reper-\ntoire, thus drastically reducing safety concerns if applied in clinics.\nTherefore, a prospective vaccine based on OMVs may also offer\nenhanced safety, improved immunogenicity, and elevated efficacy\nfor prevention of pseudomonal diseases.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the China Scholarship Council (grant\n201206240130 to K.Z.) for supporting this work.

Tumor necrosis\nfactor (TNF)-a is chronically elevated in adipose tissues of obese rodents and humans. Increased levels of\nTNF-a are implicated in the induction of atherogenic adipokines, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor\n(PAI)-1, adipose-tissue-derived monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and interleukin (IL)-6. Aucu-\nbin, an iridoid glycoside existing in medicinal plants, has been reported to show an anti-inflammatory\nactivity by suppression of TNF-a production in murine macrophages. The present study is aimed to inves-\ntigate the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced atherogenic changes of the adipokines in differentiated\n3T3-L1 cells. Aucubin significantly inhibited TNF-a-induced secretion and mRNA synthesis of the athero-\ngenic adipokines including PAI-1, MCP-1, and IL-6. Further investigation of the molecular mechanism\nrevealed that pretreatment with aucubin suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activa-\ntion, inhibitory kappa Ba (IjBa) degradation, and subsequent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB) activation.\nThese findings suggest that aucubin may improve obesity-induced atherosclerosis by attenuating TNF-a-\ninduced inflammatory responses.\n\n\ufffd 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nObesity, which is characterized by excessive accumulation of\nabdominal fat, is casually associated with the premature develop-\nment of atherosclerosis, increased risk of stroke, and development\nof congestive heart failure [1]. Recent studies have indicated that\nthe adipocyte secretes a variety of adipokines involved in energy\nmetabolism, inflammation, and cardiovascular functions [2]. The\ncellular mechanisms linking obesity and atherosclerosis are com-\nplex and have not been fully elucidated. However, increasing evi-\ndences suggest that the changes of adipokines including PAI-1,\nMCP-1, and IL-6 due to excess adipose tissue may be a cause of ath-\nerosclerosis [3].\n\nPlasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is the primary inhibitor\nof plasminogen activation. Plasma levels of PAI-1 are markedly ele-\nvated in obese individuals as well as in patients with insulin resis-\ntance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [4,5]. PAI-\n1 is thought to be the link between obesity and increased risk for\nCVDs [6]. Although several tissues are known to produce PAI-1,\nll rights reserved.\n\nllege of Natural Science and\n, Sangdang-gu, Cheongju-si,\n\n8566; fax: +82 43 229 8559.\nadipose tissue appears to be the major contributor to elevated\nPAI-1 levels observed in cases of obesity [7,8]. Monocyte chemoat-\ntractant protein (MCP)-1 chemotactically recruits monocytes to\nsites of inflammation. Although this protein is traditionally\nthought to be expressed mainly endothelial cells and macrophages,\nit has been shown to be primarily expressed by adipose tissues\n[9,10]. Adipocyte-derived MCP-1 induces macrophage infiltration\ninto adipose tissues and thus secretes inflammatory cytokines\nincluding tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, which in turn leads to\nthe dysfunction of adipocytes [11]. In addition, MCP-1 inhibits\ninsulin-dependent glucose uptake and the expression of adipo-\ngenic genes [10].\n\nAucubin is a natural constituent with a monoterpene cyclic ring\nsystem found in a wide range of some insects and higher plants\nsuch as Aucuba japonica and Plantago asiatica [12,13]. In recent\nyears, a variety of bio-activities of aucubin have been reported; li-\nver-protective activities against hepato-toxicants, stimulation of\nbile acid excretion, anti-microbial activities, anti-tumor activities,\nantidotal activities for noxious amanita mushroom poisoning,\nanti-viral activities against hepatitis B virus, and anti-inflamma-\ntory activities [14\u201322]. Interestingly, a number of plants containing\naucubin have been used long as medicinal herbs for anti-inflam-\nmatics and anti-rheumatics in Oriental and Occidental hemi-\nspheres. As for the molecular mechanism for anti-inflammatory\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.005\nmailto:parkks@cju.ac.kr\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.005\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\n408 K.S.

However,\nthe inhibitory effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced inflammatory\nresponses in adipocytes have not been reported previously.\n\nThe present study was designed to determine whether it atten-\nuates TNF-a-induced secretion and mRNA production of the ath-\nerogenic adipokines including PAI-1, MCP-1, and IL-6 in\ndifferentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, the possible mecha-\nnisms for inhibitory effects of aucubin on obesity-related inflam-\nmatory responses were examined.\nFig. 1. Effects of aucubin on TNF-a-stimulated adipokine production in 3T3-L1\nadipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed or not to increasing concentrations of\naucubin (1, 3, 10, and 30 lM) for 6 h and then were stimulated for 24 h by the\naddition of 10 ng/mL TNF-a. The secreted antigens of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 in\nconditioned medium were measured as described in Section 2. Results represent\nthe mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. ##p < 0.01 versus untreated\ncontrol; \ufffdp < 0.05, \ufffd\ufffdp < 0.01 versus TNF-a-stimulated control.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Reagents\n\nAucubin with 99.5% purity was purchased from Wako Pure\nChemical Industries Ltd., (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant murine tu-\nmor necrosis factor (TNF)-a was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,\nMN, USA). Insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxan-\nthine were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). All tissue culture mate-\nrials were from Gibco-BRL (Rockville, MD, USA). Primary anti-mouse\nantibodies for extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), phos-\npho-ERK, IjBa, phospho-IjBa, and b-actin were obtained from Cell\nSignaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Poly (ADP-ribose) poly-\nmerase (PARP) and p65 monoclonal antibodies were purchased\nfrom Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\n\n2.2. 3T3-L1 cell culture and treatment\n\n3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Rock-\nville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium\n(DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) penicil-\nlin\u2013streptomycin (10,000 U/mL penicillin and 10,000 cg/mL strep-\ntomycin in 0.85% saline), and 1% (v/v) 100 lM pyruvate at 37 \ufffdC\nin 95% air 10% CO2. Differentiation of 2-day postconfluent preadi-\npocytes (designated as day 0) was initiated with 0.5 mM 3-isobu-\ntyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 lM dexamethasone, and 1 lg/mL insulin\nin DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h\n(day 2), the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 lg/mL insulin, and\nthe cells were then fed every other day with DMEM containing\n10% fetal bovine serum. Aucubin was reconstituted, filter sterilized,\nand stored at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. For each experiment, cells received aucubin\npremixed with culture medium. TNF-a treatment was carried out\nafter a 6-h pretreatment with aucubin. Aucubin was dissolved in\ndimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before it was added to culture medium.\nThe final concentration of DMSO in culture medium was 0.5% (v/v).\n\n2.3. Measurement of adipokines by ELISA\n\nThe conditioned culture medium from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was\ncollected from each sample. The concentrations of MCP-1, PAI-1,\nand IL-6 were assayed using a mouse MCP-1 ELISA kit (R&D Sys-\ntems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a mouse PAI-1 ELISA kit (Molecular\nInnovations Inc., Southfield, MI, USA), and a mouse IL-6 ELISA kit\n(Biosource Inc., Camarillo, CA, USA), respectively. All assays were\nperformed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.4. Evaluation of gene expression levels by quantitative real-time RT-\nPCR\n\nFor real-time RT-PCR, cDNA was prepared from 1 lg total RNA\nin a final reaction volume of 15 lL. Real-time RT-PCR was per-\nformed using 2 lL cDNA diluted with each of the gene-specific pri-\nmer sets (Bioneer Inc., Korea). Each primer set was used at a\nconcentration of 150 nM in a final reaction volume of 20 lL and\nreactions were performed on the Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green I\nMaster (Roche Applied Science, Germany). The sequences for\nprimers are: MCP-1 (50-GCCCCACTCACCTGCTGCTACT-30 and 50-\nCCTGCTGCTGGTGATCCTCTTGT-30), PAI-1 (50-AGGATCGAGGT-\nAAACGAGAGC-30 and 50-GCGGGCTGAGATGACAAA-30), and IL-6\n(50-GCTACCAAACTGGATATAATCAGGA-30 and 50-CCAGGTAGCTA-\nTGGTACTCCAGAA-30). Levels of mRNA, expressed as relative mRNA\nlevels compared with control, were calculated after normalization\nto b-actin.\n\n2.5. Nuclear extraction\n\nNuclear fractions of cells were prepared as previously described\n[23]. Briefly, cells were scraped and suspended in 400 lL of cold\nbuffer A (HEPES 10 mM; pH 7.9; KCl 10 mM; EDTA 0.1 mM; EGTA\n0.1 mM; dithiothreitol 1 mM; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride\n0.5 mM; pepstatin A 1 lg/mL; leupeptin 10 lg/mL; aprotinin\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced adipokine mRNA synthesis in 3T3-L1\nadipocytes. After exposure to various concentrations of aucubin (1, 3, 10, and\n30 lM) for 6 h, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with 10 ng/mL TNF-a for 24 h.\nThen cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted for measuring the mRNA\nlevels of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 by quantitative RT-PCR. Values are normalized to b-\nactin RNA expression levels and expressed relative to untreated control cells.\nResults represent the mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. ##p < 0.01\nversus untreated control; \ufffd\ufffdp < 0.01 versus TNF-a-stimulated control.\n\nFig. 3.

Western blot analysis\n\nCell lysates were collected, and then protein concentrations\nwere determined with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay re-\nagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts\nof cell extracts were separated by electrophoresis using a 10% SDS\u2013\npolyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes\n(Whatman Protran, Whatman GmBH, Dassel, Germany). After\nbeing blocked at room temperature in 5% non-fat dry milk with\nTris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) buffer for 2 h, the blots were\nprobed with the primary antibody against each target protein at a\nconcentration of 1:500\u20131:1000 in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST\novernight at 4 \ufffdC. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and signals were de-\ntected and quantified using a chemiluminescent detection system,\nLAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Japan).\n2.7. Statistics\n\nData expressed as mean \u00b1 SD were obtained from three separate\nexperiments. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by one-\nway analysis of variance followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. P < 0.05 was\nconsidered to have significant difference.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced secretion of adipokines in\n3T3-L1 adipocytes\n\nTo examine the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-induced secretion\nof adipokines, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with various\nconcentrations of aucubin for 6 h and then incubated with 10 ng/\nmL TNF-a for 24 h. After incubation, conditioned medium was col-\nlected for ELISA assay. Treatment with aucubin inhibited TNF-a-in-\nduced increase in the secretion of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 in dose-\ndependent manner with IC50 of 8.20, 9.94, and 6.85 lM, respec-\ntively (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFig. 4.

Following\npretreatment with aucubin (1, 3, 10, and 30 lM) for 6 h, cells were treated with TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Total proteins were prepared and Western blotting was\nperformed using specific p-IjBa and IjBa antibodies. PD98059 (PD, 20 lM) was used as an ERK1/2-specific inhibitor.

Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced expression of adipokine\ngenes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes\n\nTo investigate whether aucubin inhibited TNF-a-induced secre-\ntion of adipokines by altering the gene expression, real-time quan-\ntitative RT-PCR was carried out with total RNA extracted from 3T3-\nL1 adipocytes of each group. The gene expression of adipokines\nwas measured after 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to aucubin\nfor 6 h prior to TNF-a (10 ng/mL) treatment for 24 h. The enhanced\nproduction of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 mRNA by TNF-a was sup-\npressed by aucubin pretreatment (Fig. 2). At a aucubin concentra-\ntion of 10 lM, the mRNA production of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 was\nsuppressed by 36.5%, 24.3%, and 39.0%, respectively.\n\n3.3. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced nuclear translocation of\nNF-jB\n\nSince NF-jB is a major transcription factor that modulates the\nexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it was investigated\nwhether aucubin prevents the translocation of the p65 subunit of\nNF-jB from cytosol into the nucleus using Western blotting. It\nwas found that aucubin prior to TNF-a significantly attenuated\np65 level in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3).\n\n3.4. Effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced phosphorylation of IjBa\nand ERK\n\nIn unstimulated adipocytes, NF-jB is sequested in the cytosol\nby its inhibitor IjBa, and when cells are stimulated with TNF-a,\nIjB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and rapidly degraded via\n26S proteasome, which results in the release of NF-jB. Therefore,\nthe effects of aucubin on the TNF-a-induced phosphorylation and\ndegradation of IjBa was examined using Western blotting. Aucu-\nbin significantly reduced the TNF-a-induced IjBa phosphorylation\nin a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, aucubin pretreatment\nblocked TNF-a-induced IjBa degradation (Fig. 4A). Next, the ef-\nfects of ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 (PD) on TNF-a-induced\nIjBa phosphorylation and degradation were investigated. In paral-\nlel with the effects of aucubin, pretreatment with 20 lM PD98059\nreduced the TNF-a-induced IjBa phosphorylation and degradation\nin adipocytes (Fig. 4A). These observations suggest that the phos-\nphorylation and degradation of IjBa is affected by ERK1/2 signal\npathway. In fact, it has been known that activation of IjBa degra-\ndation is a downstream event following the activation of the ERK1/\n2 pathway [24]. Thus, it was investigated whether aucubin regu-\nlates the phosphorylation of ERK using Western blotting. Challenge\nwith TNF-a brought about the ERK phosphorylation within 15 min;\nthen p-ERK band was gradually restored to basal level (Fig. 4B).\nTherefore, Western blotting for ERK was carried out after treating\nwith TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 15 min in the presence or absence of\naucubin. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with aucubin in the\nindicated concentrations for 6 h and then stimulated with TNF-a\n(10 ng/mL) for 15 min. Total cell lysates were then probed with\nphosphospecific antibodies for ERK1/2. The phosphorylation of\nERK1/2 was increased in cells treated with TNF-a alone. However,\naucubin significantly inhibited phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in\nTNF-a-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a concentration-dependent\nmanner (Fig. 4C).\n4. Discussions\n\nAucubin [1,4a,5,7a-tetra-5-hydroxy-7-(hydroxymethyl)cyclo-\npenta(c)pyran-1-yl-b-D-glucopyranoside] is a common iridoid gly-\ncoside, found in a wide range of plants, which are used in folk\nmedicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Those medicinal plants\ncontaining aucubin show a variety of biological activities as afore-\nmentioned. Of pharmaceutical products as well as dietary supple-\nments containing such medicinal plant materials, agents for\ntreating inflammatory ailments including rheumatic inflammation\nhave been marketed and used for long time. As for the molecular\nmechanism for anti-inflammatory activities of aucubin, it was re-\nported that aucubin inhibits the production of TNF-a resulting\nfrom the both IjBa degradation and the nuclear translocation of\nNF-jB in RAW 264.7 cells [21].\n\nIt was previously reported that the increased levels of TNF-a\nassociated with obesity may significantly contribute to elevated\nplasma and adipose tissue expression levels of adipokines [25].\nThis study demonstrated that aucubin effectively inhibited TNF-\na-stimulated increases in the secretion of MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6\nin 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). The mRNA production of each adipo-\nkines was suppressed in parallel with its secretion regulated by\naucubin (Fig. 2).\n\nTranscription factor NF-jB has been evidenced to play a major\nrole in the TNF-a-induced expression of adipokines in adipocytes\n[26]. NF-jB is associated and controlled by IjBa, which presents\nan inactive form in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, IjBa be-\ncomes phosphorylated, undergoes degradation, and allows NF-jB\ntranslocation into the nucleus, where it activates proinflammatory\ngenes and participates in the inflammatory response [27]. In the\npresent study, aucubin suppressed the nuclear translocation of\nNF-jB (Fig. 3), which suggests that aucubin may decrease NF-jB\nactivity by inhibition of IjBa degradation. Furthermore, it revealed\nthat ERK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 blocked degradation of\nIjBa upon TNF-a stimulation, implying that IjBa degradation is\na downstream event following the activation of the ERK1/2 path-\nway (Fig. 4A). Therefore, to confirm the inhibitory mechanisms of\nIjBa degradation by aucubin, the effects of aucubin on TNF-a-in-\nduced ERK phosphorylation were investigated. It was found that\naucubin exhibited significant inhibition on TNF-a-stimulated\nERK1/2 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent fashion\n(Fig. 4C).\n\nIn conclusion, aucubin can attenuate TNF-a-stimulated in-\ncreases in gene expression and secretion of adipokines in 3T3-L1\nadipocytes. The effects of aucubin were mediated by suppression\nof ERK phosphorylation, IjBa degradation, and subsequent NF-\njB activation. The present study may contribute to the under-\nstanding of anti-inflammatory effects of aucubin and provide a no-\nvel mechanism of aucubin in preventing obesity-related\npathologies.\nReferences\n\n[1] Douketis JD, Sharma AM.

The addition of purified individual inositol pyrophosphates to a\ncell free reconstituted RIG-I signaling assay further identified 1-IP7 as an essential component required for IRF3 activation.\nThe inositol pyrophosphate may act by b-phosphoryl transfer, since its action was not recapitulated by a synthetic\nphosphonoacetate analogue of 1-IP7.

The first step in the innate immune response\n\ninvolves recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by\n\nseveral host encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRR). A key\n\nmediator of antiviral immunity is the type-I interferon family of\n\ncytokines, which are transcribed upon detection of RNA viruses by\n\nthe pattern recognition receptors [1\u20133]. Cells have developed\n\nPRRs that are specialized for detecting pathogens in the cytosol,\n\nthe site where many RNA viruses replicate. One such PRR is the\n\nretinoic acid inducible gene - I (RIG-I) [1\u20133]. RIG-I recruits the\n\nadaptor protein MAVS to activate a signaling pathway that causes\n\nTBK1 to phosphorylate the latent transcription factor IRF3 [4\u20137].\n\nSignaling cascades triggered by multiple PRRs indeed converge to\n\nactivate IRF3. Once phosphorylated, IRF3 dimerizes and\n\ntranslocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the\n\ntranscriptional coactivators CBP/p300, which together stimulate\n\nthe expression of type-I interferon [1]. This initiates the antiviral\n\nimmune responses [8\u201310].\n\nAn optimal interferon response is essential to control viral\n\ninfections; however, excessive interferon exposure is detrimental to\n\nthe human body [11]. Significant research effort has been invested\n\nin determining the nature of the positive and negative signaling\n\npathways which regulate the responses that RIG-1 elicits following\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nviral infection [1,2,5,6,12\u201318]. Yet, there are significant gaps in\n\nour understanding of how an appropriate interferon response is\n\nregulated. For example, the regulation of the coupling of RIG-I\n\nstimulation to the activation of IRF3 is not completely understood.\n\nIn particular, it has not previously been well determined if any\n\ndiffusible second messenger molecules have signaling roles in this\n\npathway. In addition, a comparative understanding of the\n\nregulation of the unique RIG-I specific upstream and the\n\nconserved (across PRRs) downstream steps of interferon produc-\n\ntion is still lacking. In any case, the innate immune system is a\n\ncomplex, multifactorial network of interconnected pathways that\n\nexhibit combinatorial effects and emergent properties [19]; this is\n\nan entity that is much more than the sum of its individual\n\ncomponents. Systems-level analysis therefore offers the most\n\npromising approach to a comprehensive understanding of the\n\nregulation of innate immune pathways such as the interferon\n\nresponse; this information can also be exploited for the develop-\n\nment of novel therapeutic targets [20]. Some previous studies used\n\nproteomics and gene expression profiling approaches to under-\n\nstand the global regulation of innate immune response during\n\nseveral RNA viral infections [21,22]. However, a systematic\n\ninterrogation of the role of all of the annotated genes of human\n\ngenome in the RIG-I signaling and interferon production is yet to\n\nbe reported.\n\nIn this study, through a systems level approach using human\n\ngenome wide RNA-interference (RNAi) screen, bioinformatics\n\nanalysis and mechanistic validations, we generated an expanded\n\nunderstanding of the regulation of RIG-I mediated interferon\n\nresponse. We have identified 226 novel components of the RIG-1\n\npathway. In particular, the approach we took in the current study\n\nled us to identify that a class of kinases that synthesizes inositol\n\npyrophosphates are important positive regulators of the type-I\n\ninterferon response. The inositol pyrophosphates (also known as\n\ndiphosphoinositol polyphosphates) are a specialized subgroup of\n\nthe inositol phosphate signaling family that is distinguished by the\n\npresence of high-energy diphosphate groups [23\u201325]. The inositol\n\npyrophosphates are known to regulate DNA damage repair [26],\n\napoptosis [27,28], insulin exocytosis [29], and insulin signaling\n\n[30]. Although a role for inositol pyrophosphates in regulating\n\nneutrophil function has also recently emerged [31], it has not\n\npreviously been reported whether they play any role in antiviral\n\nimmunity. Now, we demonstrate for the first time that the\n\nsynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates is critical for type-I interferon\n\ntranscription and antiviral immunity.\n\nResults\n\nGenome-Wide Screening Identifies Regulators of\nRIG-I-Mediated IFNb Production\n\nTo discover novel genes regulating the RIG-I mediated\n\ninterferon response, we performed a human genome wide RNA-\n\ninterference (RNAi) screen. A quantitative fluorescence microsco-\n\npy based assay was adopted for the screen using human interferon-\n\nb (IFNb) promoter- driven green fluorescent protein reporter\n(IFNb-GFP) (Figure 1A). The assay used human embryonic kidney\n(HEK) 293 cell line, a widely used model system to dissect RIG-I\n\nsignaling [15,32,33]. As HEK293 cells do not have a robust TLR3\n\nexpression, the use of this cell line would minimize the effects from\n\nnon-RIG-I pathways [34]. As reported earlier [33], because\n\nHEK293 cells express only moderate levels of RIG-I, transfection\n\nof IFNb-GFP reporter along with the RIG-I ligand Polyinosinic:-\npolycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) into these cells leads to only a modest\n\nincrease in the GFP signal (Figure S1A). However, transfection of\n\nRIG-I expression plasmid into these cells leads to a very robust\n\nactivation of GFP signal, both with and without poly (I:C)\n\nstimulation (Figure S1A). In control experiments, silencing of RIG-\n\nI, MAVS and IRF3, drastically reduced the RIG-I transfection\n\nmediated IFNb-GFP signal, but there was no effect upon silencing\neither TRIF (TLR3 adaptor) or MDA5 (another cytosolic PRR of\n\nviruses) (Figure S1B). These experiments prove that the observed\n\nreporter activity was originating specifically through RIG-I.\n\nFor the RNAi screen, we selected a condition where, 24 hr after\n\nthe transfection of a RIG-I expression plasmid (with poly (I:C)\n\nstimulation), IFNb-GFP transcription was observed in approxi-\nmately 25% of the cells. In comparison, only 1\u20132% of the total\n\ncells were GFP-positive after silencing of the positive control genes\n\nMAVS and IRF3, representing a 26.5- and 14.3-fold decrease in\n\nIFNb-GFP reporter activity respectively (Figure S1B). High\ncontent microscopy based imaging was used to detect and quantify\n\nthe degree of activation of the IFNb reporter. For every image, we\ncalculated the GFP intensity per cell (defined as a DAPI stained\n\nnucleus), after setting an intensity threshold to identify the GFP\n\nexpressing cells. The final readout of the assay was the percent of\n\nGFP-positive cells per well.\n\nThe screen was conducted in two stages (Figure 1A). The\n\nprimary screen involved silencing 18,120 human genes using a\n\npool of four unique siRNAs (from Dharmacon) targeting each\n\ngene. Later, the \u2018\u2018hit genes\u2019\u2019 from the primary screen were further\n\nvalidated for on-target specificity by testing each of the four\n\nindividual siRNAs of the pool separately, and only those for which\n\nat least two independent siRNAs impacted on reporter signal were\n\nselected. A Z-score of (2/+) 2.5 was taken as cut-off for putative\npositive or negative regulators, respectively. The analytic param-\n\neters for the siRNA screen including the signal intensity and\n\nZ-score distributions are given in the Figures S2A\u2013D. We re-\n\nidentified several previously known regulators of RIG-I pathway\n\nsuch as RIG-I, IRF3, TRIM21, PRKR and MAVS as hits,\n\nvalidating the ability of the screen to discover proteins that\n\nregulate the interferon response [35,36]. More importantly, the\n\nRNAi screen led to the identification of a total of 226 additional\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nThe innate immune system is critical for viral infection\ncontrol by host organisms. The type I interferons are a\nfamily of major antiviral cytokines produced upon the\nactivation of innate immune pattern recognition receptors\n(PRRs) by viruses. The RIG-I is a major PRR that uniquely\ndetects RNA viruses within the cytoplasm. In this study, we\naimed to discover cellular genes and pathways that play\nregulatory roles in the transcriptional induction of type I\ninterferon-b (IFNb). Using a human genome wide RNA\ninterference (RNAi) screening, we identified 226 genes\nwhose expression is important for proper IFNb production.\nThrough bioinformatics-based mining of the RNAi screen\nresults, we identified that the cellular pathway synthesiz-\ning inositol pyrophosphates, a class of inositol phosphates\nwith high-energy diphosphates, is a key positive regulator\nof RIG-I mediated IFNb production. The kinases IPPK,\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2, that synthesize inositol pyrophos-\nphate 1-IP7, regulated IFNb response in a catalytically\ndependent manner. Mechanistic studies identified that 1-\nIP7 synthesis pathway was needed for efficient phosphor-\nylation of IRF3. The DIPP family of inositol pyrophosphate\nhydrolases negatively regulated the IFNb response, upon\nectopic expression. In summary, this study generated a\nglobal view of the regulation of RIG-I signaling, and\nidentified inositol pyrophosphates as important regulators\nof antiviral response.\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nnovel regulators of RIG-I mediated IFNb response (Table S1). Out\nof these, 220 and 6 genes respectively were positive and negative\n\nregulators of RIG-I signaling.\n\nWe subsequently performed detailed bioinformatics analysis to\n\nmine the information contained within the RNAi screen results. A\n\nmeta-analysis using the Gene Expression Omnibus database\n\nrevealed that 33 of the identified RNAi hits were previously\n\nobserved as host genes upregulated upon exposure to various RNA\n\nviruses, interferon or poly (I:C) [21,37\u201340] (Table S1). Network\n\nanalysis of the obtained hit genes revealed that several proteins\n\npreviously implicated to interact with components of interferon\n\nresponse, but not determined yet to serve a regulatory role in\n\ninterferon response, (e.g, ADAP2 [41]) are indeed needed for\n\noptimal interferon induction (Figure 1B). In addition, genes\n\nserving different functions such as those regulating nuclear\n\ntransport (RAN, XPO1), ubiquitin like proteins (UBQLN2, UBL5)\n\nand transcription (e.g., DLX3) were also among the identified hits\n\n(Table S1). Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified several\n\nstatistically significant cellular functional categories of genes\n\nregulating interferon production (Figure 1C). Most of the top-\n\nranked GO categories identified were those related to antiviral\n\ninnate immune signaling. Remarkably, gene ontology analysis also\n\nidentified the pathway involving biosynthesis of inositol pyrophos-\n\nphates as a novel cellular process associated with interferon\n\nresponse regulation (Figure 1C). Overall, our functional genomics\n\ninterrogation revealed that genes and pathways from diverse\n\nfunctional categories are regulators of RIG-I mediated interferon\n\nproduction.\n\nRIG-I Regulators Act at Multiple Steps of the PRR\nSignaling Cascade\n\nIn order to begin to generate a global mechanistic understand-\n\ning of the newly discovered regulators of IFNb response, we\nattempted to place these genes in the known framework of RIG-I\n\nsignaling. It is known that ectopic expression of MAVS, TBK1\n\nand a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 (termed IRF3-5D) can\n\nstimulate IFNb transcription, independent of RIG-I [9,17,42]. By\ncoupling the ectopic expression of these genes with individual\n\nsilencing of the newly identified regulators, we generated a detailed\n\nmap of the functional localization of their action within the RIG-I\n\nFigure 1.

The results of the \u2018\u2018stage determination assays\u2019\u2019 are\n\nshown in Figure 1A (displayed inside the brown box) and Table\n\nS1. Among the 226 hit genes, the greatest number (55%) was\n\nidentified to serve a regulatory role upstream of MAVS. Among\n\nthe rest, 5.5%, 11.3% and 25% of the total hit genes were found to\n\nfunction between MAVS and TBK1, between TBK1 and IRF3,\n\nand downstream of IRF3, respectively. In summary, this forward\n\ngenetics study revealed a global picture of the stage wise\n\ndistribution of 226 novel regulators of RIG-I signaling cascade.\n\nThe Inositol Pyrophosphate Biosynthesis Pathway Is\nEssential for RIG-I Dependent Interferon Production\n\nBioinformatics analysis of the RNAi screening results identified\n\nthe kinase PPIP5K2 as a positive regulator of RIG-1 signaling\n\n(Figure 1A, and 1B). PPIP5K2 is one of the enzymes that directly\n\nsynthesizes inositol pyrophosphates (Figure 1D). In relation to this,\n\nIPPK is another kinase that was also identified in the screen as a\n\npositive regulator of RIG-1 signaling; IPPK synthesizes IP6, which\n\nserves as the common precursor material for inositol pyrophos-\n\nphate synthesis. The key steps and enzymes involved in inositol\n\npyrophosphate biosynthesis are shown in Figure 1D. The best\n\nstudied inositol pyrophosphates in mammals are the two IP7\n\nisomers (1-IP7 and 5-IP7) and IP8 [43]. These are synthesized by\n\ntwo classes of enzymes, the IP6Ks and the PPIP5Ks [44\u201349].\n\nThe inositol pyrophosphate pathway has not previously been\n\nimplicated as participating in antiviral responses, so we set out to\n\nfurther characterize its role in innate immunity. We first validated\n\nthat the siRNAs against IPPK efficiently knocked down gene\n\nexpression (Figure 2A). Moreover, Following stimulation of these\n\ncells by transfection with RIG-I ligand poly (I:C), the knock-down\n\nof IPPK expression was confirmed to cause a major reduction of\n\nIFNb-promoter driven luciferase activity (Figure 2A). We also used\nq-RTPCR based quantification of IFNb transcripts to verify the\nrole of IPPK in influencing IFNb transcript synthesis (Figure 2B).\nFinally, transfection of siRNA resistant IPPK cDNA expressing\n\nplasmid into endogenous IPPK silenced cells using 39-UTR\n\ntargeting siRNA led to the recovery of the IFNb response to a level\ncomparable to that in normal cells, indicating the on-target\n\nspecificity of gene silencing (Fig. S3A).\n\nThe silencing of IPPK will not only reduce the formation of IP6\n\nbut also the synthesis of the inositol pyrophosphates 1-IP7, 5-IP7\n\nand IP8 (Figure 1D). The kinases PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 catalyze\n\nthe synthesis of 1-IP7 and IP8, but not 5-IP7 (Figure 1D). Indeed,\n\nthe RNAi screen also identified PPIP5K2, but not PPIP5K1, as a\n\nRIG-1 regulator (see above). So we next investigated if the inositol\n\npyrophosphates play roles in innate immunity. Silencing of the\n\nPPIP5K2 gene strongly reduced RIG-I driven IFNb transcription\nand IFNb promoter driven luciferase activity (Figure 2B,C). We\nalso retested PPIP5K1 since it was possible that the latter was\n\nmissed in the primary screen. Notably, PPIP5K1 gene silencing\n\nalso reduced the IFNb reporter activity. Gene silencing was\nverified by both Western blot (Figure 2C) and q-RTPCR (Figure\n\nS3B). The q-RTPCR based quantification also showed a notable\n\ndecrease in the IFNb transcript production in PPIP5K2 silenced\ncells (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure S3A, ectopic expression of\n\nsiRNA resistant PPIP5K2 rescued the loss of IFNb response\ncaused by ablation of endogenous PPIP5K2 using 39-UTR\n\ntargeting siRNA, confirming the on-target specificity of the\n\nknockdown. The knockdown of IPPK and PPIP5Ks did not\n\nsignificantly affect basal-level IFNb or IFNa production when\nHEK293 cells were not stimulated by either RIG-I ectopic\n\nexpression or transfection with poly (I:C) or infection with virus\n\n(Figure S3C, S3D). Using JAK1 silenced cells, it was further\n\ndetermined that the observed effects of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 silencing on interferon response are independent of the\n\nautocrine amplification of the pathway (Figure S3E).\n\nWe next investigated the possible roles of the IP6Ks (IP6K1,\n\nIP6K2 and IP6K3) which participate in the synthesis of 5-IP7 and\n\nIP8, but not 1-IP7 Figure 1D). Although none of these genes were\n\nidentified from our genome-wide RNAi screen, we re-investigated\n\ntheir role in RIG-I signaling with validation of gene silencing. It\n\nwas observed that both individual and simultaneous silencing of\n\nIP6K1, IP6K2 and IP6K3 genes did not affect the interferon\n\ntranscription (Figure 2D). Furthermore, consistent with the gene\n\nknockdown data, fibroblasts from IP6K1 gene deficient mouse did\n\nnot show any defect in the IFNb response (Figure S3F) [50]. The\nfact that the IFNb response is inhibited by knock-down of PPIP5Ks\nbut not IP6Ks (Figure 2) suggests that 1-IP7, but not 5-IP7\n\n(Figure 1D), has functional significance in the innate immune\n\nresponse. Complete loss of expression of murine IP6K1 (or the\n\nKcs1 homologue in yeast) was previously shown to adversely affect\n\nthe functioning of mitochondria, and alters ATP levels [51].\n\nHowever, no significant general cytotoxicity, mitochondrial\n\ntoxicity or change in the levels of cellular ATP was found in cells\n\ntransiently silenced for IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 (Figure\n\nS4A).\n\nThe experiments described above used poly (I:C) in order to\n\nmimic a cellular viral infection. It is therefore significant that we\n\nalso found silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 dampened\n\nIFNb transcription during infection of HEK293 cells by Sendai\nvirus (SeV), a known stimulator of RIG-I [52] (Figure 2E). To\n\nfurther validate the physiological relevance of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 in IFNb production, we also silenced the expression of\nthese kinases in human primary monocyte derived macrophages,\n\nand then challenged them with Sendai virus. We found a\n\nsignificant decrease in IFNb transcription in these RNAi-targeted\nhuman primary macrophages (Figure 2F). No notable difference in\n\nSeV induced IFNb response was observed when IP6K1-3 genes\nwere silenced (not shown). These experiments further indicate that\n\nthe expression of the kinases involved in the synthesis of 1-IP7 is\n\nimportant for an effective interferon response.\n\nThe Inositol Pyrophosphate Synthesis Pathway\nSpecifically Regulates the Interferon Axis from Multiple\nPRRs\n\nIn addition to the transcriptional induction of IFNb, signaling\nfrom several of the PRRs that sense RNA viruses also result in the\n\nproduction of another class of type-I interferons, the IFNa, as well\nas activation of the transcription factor NFkB [5]. Therefore it was\nimportant to determine whether inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-\n\npathway kinases are also required for the IFNa and NFkB response\nfrom RIG-I. We observed that silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 in HEK293 cells led to a reduction in RIG-I mediated\n\ntranscription of IFNa, determined using a luciferase reporter\ndriven by the IFNa4 promoter (Figure 2G). However, inositol\npyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases were not required for\n\nRIG-I triggered NFkB activation (Figure 2H). This data indicated\nthat these kinases regulate a step of RIG-I signaling that happens\n\nafter the bifurcation of interferon and NFkB branches.\nIn addition to RIG-I, there are several other PRRs such as\n\nTLR3 (an endosomal PRR) and MDA5 (another cytosolic PRR),\n\nwhich also induce IFNb transcription [1]. Therefore we investi-\ngated the specificity of the inositol pyrophosphates-synthesis-\n\npathway kinases with regards to signaling by other PRRs. We\n\nfound that repression of the expression of either IPPK, PPIP5K1\n\nor PPIP5K2 attenuated the IFNb response elicited by both TLR3\nand MDA5, to a level comparable to that observed in the case of\n\nRIG-I (Figure 2I). These results demonstrated that inositol\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Indeed, the\n\nIFNb induction arising from ectopic expression of MAVS and\nTBK1, two key downstream components of RIG-I pathway, was\n\ndiminished when IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 were silenced\n\n(Figure 3A). These data further indicate that the inositol\n\npyrophosphates most likely regulate a step at the level or\n\nimmediately downstream of TBK1. Because activation of IRF3\n\nhappens immediately downstream of TBK1, we next investigated\n\nthe effect of interference with inositol pyrophosphate synthesis\n\npathway gene expression on IRF3 functioning. The IRF3 exists as\n\na monomer in its unstimulated state in the cytosol. When PRRs\n\nare stimulated, the phosphorylation of monomeric IRF3 leads to\n\nits homo-dimerization, followed by nuclear migration. We first\n\ninvestigated whether inositol pyrophosphate synthesis was needed\n\nfor the nuclear translocation of activated endogenous IRF3. In\n\ncontrol experiments, the negative control siRNA treated HEK293\n\ncells were stimulated with poly (I:C), which led to a prominent\n\nnuclear accumulation of phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3; Figure 3B).\n\nIn additional control experiments, silencing of MAVS, the key\n\nadaptor of RIG-I, reduced the nuclear levels of pIRF3 (Figure 3B).\n\nNotably, there was also a major reduction in the intra-nuclear\n\nlevels of endogenous pIRF3 following silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1\n\nand PPIP5K2 (Figure 3B, 3C).\n\nNext, we investigated whether the depletion of IPPK, PPIP5K1\n\nand PPIP5K2 altered endogenous IRF3 dimerization. The\n\nknockdown of all three of these genes strongly reduced the degree\n\nof IRF3 dimerization that was induced by poly (I:C)(Figure 3D,E),\n\ncompared to that observed in negative control siRNA treated cells.\n\nThe levels of GAPDH and Tubulin proteins were unaffected by\n\nthe knockdown of these kinases, indicating there was not a global\n\nperturbation of protein expression (Figures 3B, 3F).\n\nWe finally determined whether poly (I:C) induced phosphory-\n\nlation of endogenous IRF3 was affected by silencing of inositol\n\npyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases. Notably, it was found\n\nthat knock-down of the expression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of endoge-\n\nnous IRF3 (Figure 3F, 3G). In summary, the experiments\n\ndescribed above argue that the expression of inositol pyrophos-\n\nphate-synthesis pathway kinases is required for the TBK1-IRF3\n\naxis to function; the absence of inositol pyrophosphate synthesis\n\ncompromised IRF3 phosphorylation and dimer formation.\n\nInositol Pyrophosphate Synthesis Pathway Regulates\nInterferon Response in a Catalytically Dependent Manner\n\nHaving established the involvement of the inositol pyrophos-\n\nphate-synthesis-pathway as a regulator of antiviral response, we\n\nfurther sought to identify the mechanism by which this pathway\n\nmodulates interferon signaling. We first investigated whether\n\nenhancing the cellular expression of these kinases has any effect on\n\nthe interferon response. Indeed it was determined that the ectopic\n\nexpression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 induced a significant\n\ndose dependent enhancement of RIG-I driven IFNb promoter\nreporter activity, in both the cells that were either stimulated or\n\nunstimulated with poly (I:C) (Figure 4A). However, the enhancing\n\neffect of ectopic expression of these genes on the IFNb reporter\nactivity in cells pre-transfected with RIG-I and poly (I:C) was\n\ngreater than that in the unstimulated cells (Figure 4A). Both\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 ectopic expression caused a greater\n\nenhancement of the IFNb response than did by IPPK. Even\nthough silencing of IP6Ks did not affect IFNb response, we also\ninvestigated whether the ectopic expression of IP6K1-3 has any\n\neffect on IFNb response. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of\nIP6K1, IP6K2 and IP6K3 also enhanced the IFNb response\nsignificantly, although to a lesser degree than that promoted by\n\noverexpression of either PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 (Figure 4B). These\n\ndata revealed that the interferon response could be augmented by\n\nover-expression of any of the tested kinases in the inositol\n\npyrophosphate synthesis pathway.\n\nIn order to determine whether the kinase activity of these\n\nproteins is important for the interferon transcription, we next\n\ntransfected cells with catalytically-inactive mutants. These mutant\n\nproteins were found to express at levels comparable to the\n\ncorresponding wild type kinases. Remarkably, the kinase deficient\n\nmutants of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 all exhibited a\n\ndecreased ability to facilitate the interferon response upon over\n\nexpression, when compared with the corresponding wild type\n\nproteins (Figure 4C). In addition, we noted an earlier report that\n\nthe kinase domain of PPIP5K1 (PPIP5K1-KD) and PPIP5K2\n\n(PPIP5K2-KD) was able to catalyze the formation of 1-IP7, with\n\ngreater efficiency than the full-length protein [47]. As shown in\n\nFigure 4D, indeed we found that over expression of both\n\nPPIP5K1-KD and PPIP5K2-KD enhanced the IFNb reporter\nactivity to an extent greater than that induced by full length\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2. We also found that inactivation of the\n\ncatalytic activity of IP6K1 significantly diminished its ability to\n\nenhance IFNb response upon ectopic expression (Figure 4C).\nHowever, consistent with the gene knockdown data showing no\n\nrole for endogenous IP6Ks in RIG-I signaling, HEK293 cells\n\ntreated with IP6K kinase inhibitor TNP (N2-[m-Trifluorobenzyl],\n\nN6-[p-nitrobenzyl] purine) did not show any defect in IFNb\nresponse (Figure S3G) [53]. These experiments demonstrated that\n\nthe inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases regulated\n\nIFNb transcription through their catalytic activities. That is, one or\nmore of the soluble inositol pyrophosphates products are required\n\nfor IFNb production.\nThe ability of ectopically expressed PPIP5K1/2 to stimulate\n\ninterferon transcription (Figure 4A) could result from increased\n\nsynthesis of either 1-IP7 and/or IP8 (Figure 1D). For IP8 to be\n\ninvolved, IP6K activity would also be required. However, the\n\nstimulatory effects of over-expressed PPIP5K1/2 were not affected\n\nby either individual or simultaneous silencing of IP6K1-3\n\n(Figure 3E). Moreover, in control experiments, silencing of IPPK\n\nnearly completely abolished the ability of ectopically expressed\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 to enhance interferon transcription\n\n(Figure 4F). That result is consistent with the requirement for\n\nIP6 as the precursor molecule for phosphorylation by PPIP5K1/2\n\nto synthesize 1-IP7 (Figure 1D). It was also observed that the\n\ndiminished interferon response caused by PPIP5K1 silencing\n\ncould be compensated by over expressed PPIP5K2, or vice versa\n\n(Figure 4G). These data indicate that 1-IP7 mediates the interferon\n\ntranscriptional effects of the PPIP5K1/2.\n\nNevertheless, even though the aforementioned experiments\n\nidentify 1-IP7 as being more important for enhancing interferon\n\ntranscription than IP8, the ectopic expression of IP6K1, IP6K2\n\nand IP6K3 also enhanced the IFNb response significantly\n(Figure 4B). These results raise the possibility that, at elevated\n\nIP6K1-3 expression levels, IP8 (and/or possibly even 5-IP7) might\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

However,\nenhanced IFNb reporter activity induced by ectopic expression of\nIP6K1-3 was mostly lost in the absence of expression of PPIP5K1\n\nand PPIP5K2 (Figure 4H). Thus, it is more likely that, at high\n\nlevels of expression of IP6K1-3, it is IP8 rather than 5-IP7 that\n\nsubstitutes for the actions of 1-IP7. In this respect, it is notable that\n\none of the diphosphate groups on IP8 is also attached to the 1-\n\nposition.\n\nTo further establish the role of inositol pyrophosphates in the\n\nimmune response, we also studied a class of enzymes that\n\ndephosphorylates inositol pyrophosphates. In humans, the hydro-\n\nlysis of short-lived inositol pyrophosphates has been attributed to\n\nthree classes of diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate phosphohydro-\n\nlase proteins (DIPPs) encoded by four genes belonging to the\n\nNudix hydrolase family [44,54,55]. These hydrolases remove the\n\nterminal phosphate from inositol pyrophosphates. If inositol\n\npyrophosphates regulate RIG-I signaling, then removal of their\n\ndiphosphate would inhibit the interferon response. To test this\n\nprediction, we determined the effect of over expression of DIPP1,\n\nDIPP2a and DIPP3a on RIG-I induced IFNb promoter driven\nreporter activity. In agreement with our hypothesis, cells\n\nectopically expressing either DIPP1, DIPP2a or DIPP3a indeed\nshowed a significantly attenuated interferon response (Figure 4I;\n\nthe rank order of efficacy of the DIPPs followed their reported\n\nrank order of catalytic activity (DIPP1.DIPP3a.DIPP2a [54].\nThese data also further argued that the synthesis of inositol\n\npyrophosphates is critical for the induction of IFNb. In summary,\nthe experiments described in this section argue that inositol\n\npyrophosphates \u2013particularly 1-IP7 - are important for the\n\ninterferon response.\n\n1-IP7 Directly Mediates IRF3 Activation\nThe data described above, obtained from experiments using\n\ngene silencing and catalytically inactive mutants of IPPK,\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2, provided strong yet indirect evidence\n\nfor the involvement of inositol pyrophosphates themselves in the\n\ninterferon response. To further test this hypothesis, we employed a\n\ncell-free, virus-dependent assay for IRF3 activation. This was\n\ndeveloped in an earlier study which reported that a purified\n\nmitochondrial fraction from Sendai virus infected cells could\n\ninduce IRF3 phosphorylation in a cytoplasmic fraction prepared\n\nfrom uninfected cells [56]. We reproduced these results (Figure 5A)\n\nusing similar subcellular fractions (Figure S4B). It was significant\n\nthat the degree of IRF3 phosphorylation was strongly reduced\n\nwhen the cytoplasmic fraction was prepared from PPIP5K2-\n\nsilenced cells (Figure 5A). Next, we reasoned that if inositol\n\npyrophosphates were directly involved in IRF3 phosphorylation,\n\ntheir addition to the in vitro assay system would rescue the loss of\n\nIRF3 activation caused by the silencing of PPIP5K2. For these\n\nexperiments we added samples of either 1-IP7, 5-IP7 or IP8 that\n\nwere prepared enzymatically and purified electrophoretically [57],\n\nto the cell free IRF3 phosphorylation assays. Remarkably, 5 min\n\nafter the addition of 1-IP7 in the range of its projected\n\nphysiological concentration (0.5 uM [54]) the loss of IRF3\n\nphosphorylation that resulted from PPIP5K2 silencing was rescued\n\nto a level that was equivalent to that in wild type cells (Figure 5B).\n\nAt this time point, IP8 had no significant effect (Figure 5C).,\n\nHowever, IP8 was found to substitute for 1-IP7 in promoting IRF3\n\nphosphorylation, at the 10 min time point (Figure 5C,E). The\n\neffect of 1-IP7 on IRF3 phosphorylation is consistent with the\n\nconclusions drawn from the above described kinase silencing and\n\nectopic expression experiments. Next, we tested 5-IP7 which from\n\ngenetic experiments (see above) was predicted not to regulate the\n\ninterferon response. Indeed, we found that 5-IP7 did not promote\n\nIRF3 phosphorylation (Figure 5D). The observation that IP8 acted\n\nless efficiently than 1-IP7 in supporting IRF3 phosphorylation in\n\nvitro, is consistent with that activity in intact cells only emerging in\n\nan over-expression paradigm (Figure 4). In the latter case, IRF3\n\nphosphorylation was stimulated upon ectopic expression of IP6Ks\n\nin a manner that was also dependent upon endogenous PPIP5Ks\n\n(Figure 4H), and hence the synthesis of IP8 (Figure 1D). In\n\nconclusion, these cell free system based experiments considerably\n\nstrengthened our hypothesis (see above) that among the inositol\n\npyrophosphates, it is 1-IP7 that is the more physiologically-\n\nrelevant mediator of IRF3 phosphorylation and activation.\n\nEarlier studies had indicated that one mechanism by which the\n\ninositol pyrophosphates regulates signaling pathways involves the\n\ntransfer of the b-phosphoryl of their diphosphate group to\nphosphorylated serine residues on target proteins (termed protein\n\npyrophosphorylation) [58,59]. We therefore investigated whether\n\nthe mechanism of action of inositol pyrophosphates in the\n\ninterferon response could be dependent on the transfer of their b-\nphosphate. For these experiments we used synthetic analogues of\n\n1-IP7 and IP8, in which the diphosphate was replaced with a\n\nphosphonoacetic acid (PA) ester [60]. Although the PA ester\n\nresembles a diphosphate group in several respects, its terminal\n\nphosphonate group (equivalent to the b-phosphate of a diphos-\nphate) cannot be transferred, due to the stability of the P-C bond\n\nit contains. Interestingly, we found that addition of the PA\n\nanalogues of 1-IP7 and IP8 failed to recapitulate the actions of\n\nthe natural 1-IP7 and IP8 molecules (Figure 5F, 5G). These data\n\nare consistent with potential phosphoryl transfer underlying the\n\nmechanism of action of inositol pyrophosphates in regulating\n\ninterferon signaling.\n\nInositol Pyrophosphates Synthesis Pathway is Required\nfor Cellular Antiviral Resistance\n\nWe also investigated whether inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-\n\npathway kinases contribute to the immune resistance of human\n\ncells to viral infection. For this, we used Sendai virus to infect\n\nHEK293 cells in which either IPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 was\n\nknocked-down. In each case, the kinase knock-down led to an\n\nincreased viral load, as determined by q-RTPCR (Figure 6A).\n\nFurthermore, we also found that HEK293 cells were more\n\nresistant to infection with influenza A virus upon over expression\n\nof either IPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 (Figures 6B and 6C).\n\nInterestingly, ectopic expression of IP6K1 also enhanced the\n\ncellular immunity to influenza A virus infection, in agreement with\n\ntheir ability to increase the interferon response upon ectopic\n\nPPIP5K2 on p(I:C) induced phosphorylation of IRF3, shown by Western blot and densitometry, respectively. A representative Western blot for each\nexperiment is shown. The IFNb-luciferase values were normalized with Renilla luciferase reporter values, and expressed as fold change from\nuninduced NT-si samples. Densitometry values represent measured intensities of the indicated bands from three different Western blots, shown as\nmean 6 SD. The significance of densitometry data was calculated by comparing the values obtained from gene silenced conditions with that of\nstimulated NT-si controls. For panel A, the significance was determined by comparing the values of IFNb-luciferase activity obtained upon over\nexpression of RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1 in IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 gene silenced samples with that of corresponding NT-si samples.

As shown in Figure 6D, knock-down of either\n\nIPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 attenuated the induction of ISG15.\n\nThis was specifically due to a defect in interferon production or\n\nindirect induction of ISG15 by IRF3, because the inositol\n\npyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway did not show any role in\n\nexogenous IFNb induced, JAK/STAT signaling mediated ISRE\nactivation (not shown). Furthermore, we also found that both\n\np(I:C) stimulation and Sendai virus infection moderately enhanced\n\nthe transcription of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 in HEK293\n\ncells (Figure 6E). In summary, these results further confirmed that\n\ninositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases are required for\n\ninterferon mediated antiviral innate immunity.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur manuscript provides important new information concern-\n\ning the regulation of the interferon-mediated innate immune\n\nresponse to infection by RNA viruses. For example, our human\n\ngenome-wide RNAi screen identified 226 novel regulators of RIG-\n\n1 mediated IFNb transcription. A particularly significant finding of\nthis genomic study was the identification of the pathway\n\nsynthesizing inositol pyrophosphate 1-IP7 as being essential for\n\nthe interferon response. Moreover, this is the first time that a\n\nspecific function for 1-IP7 has been identified in mammalian cells,\n\nthereby opening up a new area of research in the inositol\n\npyrophosphate field.\n\nThe importance of a genome-wide, systems-biology approach to\n\nunderstanding the innate immune response was outlined in the\n\nIntroduction. Among these newly identified genes, several may be\n\n\u2018\u2018pan-regulators\u2019\u2019 of interferon induction. Indeed, our secondary\n\nassays revealed that 36.3% of the identified genes act downstream\n\nof TBK1, a common component of several antiviral PRR\n\npathways. It is interesting to note that more than half (60.5%) of\n\nthe hit genes regulated a segment of the signaling chain that is\n\nlikely unique to RIG-I pathway (upstream of TBK1), and not\n\ncommon with other interferon inducing PRR pathways. This\n\nindicates that the regulation of the proximal steps of PRR signaling\n\nleading to interferon induction is more complex than the\n\ncommonly shared steps. Given their distinct compartmentalized\n\ncellular localizations, it is not surprising that the PRRs undergo\n\nmore intricate regulation at their proximal signaling steps, than the\n\ndownstream conserved steps.\n\nThe meta-analysis demonstrated that at least 33 of the obtained\n\nhit genes were previously reported to show transcriptional up-\n\nregulation during challenge with various immune stimuli that\n\nactivates interferon response. However the functional relevance of\n\nthe differential expression of these 33 genes during interferon\n\nresponse was not known previously. Our identification of these\n\ngenes as important regulators of the interferon response demon-\n\nstrates that the current systems biology based approach to study\n\nRIG-I signaling also helps to functionally interpret genomics\n\nstudies of host responses to infection. We further anticipate that\n\nour data-set will facilitate future studies in this field. Given that\n\nPRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns\n\nproduced by endogenous stress signals [61], it is intriguing that\n\ninositol pyrophosphates have also been implicated in mediating\n\nresponses to a variety of stress responses, including osmotic stress,\n\nthermal challenges and metabolic stress [43]. Our study opens up\n\npossible new directions for identifying the mechanisms of action of\n\ninositol pyrophosphates in combating these stresses.\n\nOur study characterized an essential regulatory role for inositol\n\npyrophosphates in the interferon production. Although an earlier\n\nstudy had identified PPIP5K2 as an interferon inducible gene [39],\n\ninositol pyrophosphates themselves have not been shown before to\n\nplay any direct role in antiviral innate immune response.\n\nStructural analysis of PPIP5K2 [62] has revealed that it has an\n\nexquisitely specific active site that can only phosphorylate IP6 and\n\n5-IP7, to yield 1-IP7 and IP8 respectively. The in vitro reconstituted\n\nRIG-I signaling assay using purified inositol pyrophosphates\n\nidentified that both 1-IP7 and IP8 are capable of regulating the\n\ninterferon response. However, based on the comparative analysis\n\nof the results of experiments involving silencing of the key enzymes\n\nin this pathway along with effects of over-expression of wild-type\n\nkinases, we propose that 1-IP7 would most likely be the\n\nphysiologically-relevant regulator of IFNb transcription (among\ninositol pyrophosphates).\n\nThe results of the virus-dependent cell free reconstitution\n\nassays (Figure 5) provided additional direct evidence that 1-IP7 is\n\nneeded for the functioning of TBK1-IRF3 axis leading to the\n\nphosphorylation of IRF3, a precondition for its competence to\n\nstimulate IFNb transcription. Currently it is proposed that\ninositol pyrophosphates may regulate cellular pathways either\n\nby b-phosphoryl transfer to host proteins (protein pyropho-\nsphorylation), or as cofactors that may bind to target proteins\n\n[43,58,59,63\u201365]. We found that synthetic, metabolically stable\n\nanalogues of 1-IP7 and IP8 failed to recapitulate the effects of the\n\nphysiological isomers (Figure 5), consistent with a mechanism of\n\naction involving phosphoryl transfer. Nevertheless, given that in\n\nearlier studies [59] all of the inositol pyrophosphates were equally\n\ncompetent at b-phosphoryl transfer to proteins, it is intriguing\nthat 5-IP7 did not support IRF3 phosphorylation, suggesting that\n\nthe potential target protein may also exhibit stereo-selective\n\nbars) or without (black bars) p(I:C)stimulation.

It is also interesting that the phosphatidylinositol 5-\n\nphosphate, a member of the separate inositol-lipid signaling\n\nfamily, was recently reported to stimulate IRF3 phosphorylation\n\n[66]. Thus, the distinct regulatory properties of both membrane-\n\nrestricted signals (inositol lipids) and soluble, diffusible signals\n\n(inositol pyrophosphates), may converge upon the innate immune\n\nresponse to viral invasion.\n\nLastly, our study may seed the discovery of novel drug targets\n\nand drugs that can be used to manipulate the interferon response,\n\nthereby improving therapy for viral infection.

In summary, this study provided\n\nvaluable insights into the global regulation of interferon response,\n\nand identified a novel role for inositol pyrophosphates in antiviral\n\nimmunity.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nRNA Interference Screen and Bioinformatics Analysis\nThe RNAi screening employed a siRNA library from\n\nDharmacon/ThermoFischer scientific (human whole genome\n\nsiGENOME siRNA Library, Cat#GU-005005-02) targeting\n18,164 annotated human genes was used the RNAi screening.\n\nThe screen was performed in 384 well imaging compatible plates\n\n(Corning cat#3712). Briefly, 2500 HEK293 cells (in 20 ml of\nDMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum) were seeded in each well\n\nhaving 50 nM siRNA complexed with 0.05 ml lipid Dharmafect1\n(in 20 ml of serum free DMEM) (ThermoFischer scientific). At\n46 hr, 40 ng RIG-I and 50 ng human IFNb-GFP reporter\nplasmids (in 5 ml of serum free DMEM) were transfected with\nFugene (Roche). At 52 hr, 2 ml of a 10 mg/ml stock of poly (I:C)\ncomplexed with the lipid Fugene (Roche) in serum free DMEM\n\nwas added to each well. At 72 hr, the cells were fixed with 3%\n\nparaformaldehyde, followed by washing with phosphate buffered\n\nsaline and nuclear staining with DAPI. Using high content\n\nfluorescence microscopy (ImageXpress Micro, Molecular Devices\n\nCorporation), images of each well was captured at 46 magnifi-\ncation. The number of cells, and number of GFP positive cells\n\nwere determined by algorithm-driven data analysis using the\n\nMetaXpress software (Version 3, Molecular Devices Corporation).\n\nAny gene silencing that reduced cell number by greater than\n\napproximately 50% was eliminated for potential toxicity. siRNAs\n\ntargeting IRF3 and MAVS were used as positive controls, and a\n\nnon-targeting (NT) siRNA served as the negative control.\n\nThe bioinformatics analysis of the siRNA screen was facilitated\n\nby the RNAither package of Bioconductor in R [67]. The screen\n\nwas performed in duplicate. The mean percent GFP-positive cells\n\nwas calculated for each gene (the screen was performed in\n\nduplicate), and then a Z-score normalization was performed by\n\nsubtracting the median of the plate and dividing by the median\n\nabsolute deviation per plate.\n\nGene ontology enrichment analysis and network analysis was\n\nconducted on the 226 novel regulators that were identified in the\n\nsecondary siRNA screen using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)\n\nsoftware.\n\nGene Expression Meta-Analysis\nGene expression datasets were accessed from the NCBI Gene\n\nExpression Omnibus in series matrix file format from five previous\n\nstudies [21,37\u201340]. Raw expression values were log2-transformed.\n\nTwo-group comparisons were made between sample sets using\n\nStudent\u2019s t-test followed by the false-discovery rate (FDR) method\n\nto correct for multiple hypothesis testing, setting the cut-off at\n\nFDR,0.05. Significantly differentially expressed genes from each\n\nstudy were then queried against the list of 226 genes identified\n\nfrom the RNAi screen.\n\nReporter Assays\nThe reporter assays were performed as previously reported\n\n[9,42]. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression\n\nplasmids of human PRRs (RIG-I or TLR3 or MDA5), human\n\nIFNa4 promoter, or human IFNb promoter or NFkB-target\npromoter driven luciferase reporters (pGL2 vector, Promega) and\n\na constitutively transcribed Renilla luciferase reporter (p-RL-TK,\n\nPromega) for 24 hr. Cells were then either directly assayed for\n\nluciferase activity, or were stimulated with poly (I:C) by either\n\ntransfecting (500 ng/ml for RIG-I assay) or by adding to the\n\nmedium (20 mg/ml for TLR3) for additional 18 hr, and luciferase\nreading was performed using Dual-Glo assay kit (Promega). For\n\nectopic expression assays, HEK293 cells grown overnight were\n\ntransfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 hr with or without\n\nRIG-I and poly (I:C), and luciferase assays were performed.\n\nValues were normalized to that of Renilla luciferase internal\n\ncontrol.\n\nViral Infection and Viral Load Determination\nHEK293 cells or primary macrophages were infected with\n\nSendai virus (Cantell strain, Charles River Laboratories) at 30\u201380\n\nHA units for 18 hr, and processed for q-RTPCR. A genetically\n\nmodified Influenza A virus (IAV) (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) with\n\ngreen fluorescent protein insertion was propagated in MDCK cells\n\nand used for the studies [68]. The HEK293 cells were infected\n\nwith IAV at an MOI of 2 for 12 hr, fixed and microscopy was\n\nperformed.\n\nIRF3 Phosphorylation, Dimerization and Nuclear\nMigration Assays\n\nThe IRF3 activity was determined using previously reported\n\nprotocols [42,69,70]. Detection of IRF3 phosphorylation: Over-\n\nnight grown 56105 HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected\nwith 500 ng of RIG-I for 24 hr, and stimulated with 4 mg of poly\n(I:C) for 4 hr. The clarified cell lysate in RIPA buffer (50 mM\n\nTrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1%\n\nSDS, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) (pooled from three wells,\n\nfor each condition) were separated by Sodium dodecyl sulphate\n\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and probed with\n\nanti-pIRF3 (Serine 396) and anti-IRF3 antibodies. For the detection\n\nof IRF3 dimers, after 4 hr stimulation, the cells were lysed in mild\n\ncold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA\n\nand 1% NP-40), and the protein was separated on native acrylamide\n\ngel, with 1% sodium deoxycholate in the cathode buffer. The IRF3\n\ndimer was visualized by Western blot. For the detection of IRF3\n\nnuclear migration by Western blot, after 4 hr stimulation, nuclei\n\nwere isolated using Nuclear extraction Kit (Activemotif), and\n\ncytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE\n\nand detected by Western blot. For the Western blot, the proteins\n\nwere transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes using Transblot\n\n(Biorad), and detected by immuno-detection with appropriate\n\nprimary antibodies. The transferred proteins of interest were\n\nvisualized using Licor infrared imaging system, with IRDye\n\n800CW and 680RD as secondary antibodies (Licor).\n\nIn Vitro Reconstituted IRF3 Phosphorylation Assay\nThis assay was performed as reported earlier [56]. Briefly,\n\ncytoplasm from uninfected cells was incubated with isolated\n\nmitochondrial fraction from Sendai virus infected cells at 30uC,\nand pIRF3/IRF3 were detected by Western blot (visualized using\n\nHRP conjugated secondary antibody) at different time points. The\n\nassay buffer was 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 2 mM ATP,\n\n5 mM MgCl2, and 0.25 M D-mannitol.\n\nSynthesis and Purification of 1-IP7, 5-IP7 and IP8\nThe methodology was reported previously [57]. The inositol\n\npyrophosphates were prepared enzymatically, using 1.2 mM\n\nInsP6 as starting substrate. The synthesis of 1-InsP7, 5-InsP7\n\nand InsP8 were carried out by incubating (at 37uC) IP6 with\nrespectively 0.12 mg/ml PPIP5K2KD for 22.5 h, 0.17 mg/ml\n\nIP6K1 for 3 h or 0.17 mg/ml IP6K1 and 0.11 mg/ml\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nPPIP5K2KD together for 3 h. The reaction buffer composition\n\nwas 20 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgSO4, 1 mM\n\nDTT, 6 mM phosphocreatine, 24 unit/ml creatine kinase and\n\n5 mM ATP disodium salt. The reactions were quenched and\n\nneutralized with, respectively, 0.2 volumes 2 M HClO4 and 0.34\n\nvolumes 1 M K2CO3, 40 mM EDTA or placed at 100uC for 3\u2013\n5 min. The synthesized inositol pyrophosphates were purified\n\nusing a previously reporter polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-\n\nbased method that was modified for scale up [71]. The inositol\n\npyrophosphates were detected by staining with Toluidine Blue\n\n[71], and quantified through mass assay of the released\n\northophosphate upon complete hydrolysis by wet-ashing at\n\n120uC for 48 h [72]. The phosphonoacetic acid (PA) analogues\nof 1-IP7 and IP8 were chemically synthesized using a similar\n\nstrategy to that previously reported for 5-IP7 [60].

{"title": "Estrogen receptor _ inhibits estradiol-induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells through regulation of mitofusin 2", "warc_date": "20220328", "text": "INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  1993-2000,  2013\n\nAbstract. In the present study, we investigated whether estrogen \nreceptor (ER) \u03b2 affected the proliferation and migration of the \nhuman breast cancer cell line MCF-7 through regulation of \nmitofusin 2 (mfn2). A previous study reported that mfn2 may \nbe regulated by ER through a non-classical pathway; in this \npathway, the ER modulates the activities of other transcription \nfactors by stabilizing their binding to DNA and/or recruiting \ncoactivators to the complex. However, the previous study, unlike \nthe study presented here, did not directly explore the interac-\ntions between ER and mfn2. Here, RT-PCR and western blot \nanalysis were used to test the expression of mfn2 in MCF-7 cells \nafter exposure to different doses of estradiol (E2). The ability \nof cells to proliferate and migrate was determined by MTT \nassay and a monolayer-wounding protocol, respectively. Finally, \nchanges in MCF-7 cell biology after transfection with ER\u03b2 or \nmfn2 expression vectors were investigated, and the role of ER\u03b2 \nin mfn2 expression was also explored. Our results showed that \nE2 attenuated mfn2 expression in a dose-dependent manner, \nconcomitant with the activation of proliferation and migration of \nMCF-7 cells. The mfn2 expression vector effectively suppressed \nE2-induced upregulation of PCNA and migration in MCF-7 \ncells. ER\u03b2 inhibited the E2-induced mfn2 downregulation that \naccompanied the inhibition of proliferation and migration in \nMCF-7 cells. Briefly, ER\u03b2 may inhibit E2-induced proliferation \nand migration of MCF-7 cells through regulation of mfn2.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBoth clinical and epidemiological evidence show that estrogens \nparticipate in the initiation and development of human breast \ncancer (1,2). Understanding the role of both types of estrogen \n\nreceptor (ER) (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2), in the pathogenesis of breast \ncancer is important, because effects of estrogen are mediated \nthrough both of these ERs (3-6). Although the function of ER\u03b1 \nhas been established and its remains the most important marker \nof response to hormonal therapy in breast cancer, the role of ER\u03b2 \nremains elusive with many conflicting studies (7). The two ERs \nact in distinct ways in several estrogen target cells and tissues \n(8,9). There are two major conclusions to be drawn from current \nresearch situation of ERs. First, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 have different \nbiological functions, which are indicated by their distinct expres-\nsion patterns and the different phenotypes reported for the two \nERs in knockout animals, respectively. Second, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 \nhave overlapping yet unique roles in estrogen signaling, as judged \nfrom a number of gene expression profiling studies.\n\nMitofusin 2 (mfn2), also named as hyperplasia suppressor \ngene for its antiproliferative effects, localizes to the mito-\nchondrial outer membrane and plays an essential role \nin mitochondrial fusion, thus regulating mitochondrial \nmorphology and function. Chen et al (10) recently demon-\nstrated that mfn2 profoundly suppresses cell growth and \nproliferation in multiple tumor cell lines and rat vascular \nsmooth muscle cells in vivo and in culture systems via inhibi-\ntion of the Ras-ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Also, there \nis some evidence suggesting a protective effect of mfn2 in \nmammalian cells (11-13).\n\nThere is a growing body of literature suggesting that estrogen \nmay modulate expression of some genes through a non-classical \npathway in which the ER interacts with other transcription \nfactors, a process referred to as transcription factor cross-talk. In \nthis pathway, the ER modulates the activities of other transcrip-\ntion factors, such as activator protein (AP)-1, by stabilizing their \nbinding to DNA and/or recruiting coactivators to the complex. \nDeNardo et al (14) identified sets of estrogen-induced genes, \nincluding mfn2, whose promoters contain potential AP-1 sites \nbut no estrogen-responsive element (ERE) sequences, essential \nfor a classical model of estrogen action; these genes thus depend \non AP-1 for their expression. Further characterization of the \npromoters suggested that the ER regulated these genes through \nthe non-classical pathways mentioned above. However, the \nprevious study, unlike the study presented here, did not directly \nexplore the interaction between ERs and mfn2.\n\nIn the present study, we showed that ER\u03b2 inhibits human \nbreast cancer cell proliferation and migration by inducing \n\nEstrogen receptor \u03b2 inhibits estradiol-induced proliferation and \nmigration of MCF-7 cells through regulation of mitofusin 2\n\nLI MA1,2,  YUEPING LIU3,  CUIZHI GENG2,  XIAOWEI QI1  and  JUN JIANG1\n\n1Breast Disease Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing;  \nDepartments of 2Breast Disease Center and 3Pathology, The Fourth Hospital of  \n\nHebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, P.R.

We report for the first time that ER\u03b2 acts \nupstream of mfn2. Moreover, this observation indicated that \nmfn2 affects the proliferation and migration of human breast \ncancer cells.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCell lines and groups. MCF-7, a human breast cancer cell line, \nwas kindly provided by Professor Mei-xiang Sang, Division \nof Scientific Research, the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical \nUniversity, Shijiazhuang, China. Cells were cultured in growth \nmedium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium \n(DMEM) (Gibco-BRL, USA) containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 2 mM \nL-glutamine, 5,000 IU/l penicillin, 5 mg/l streptomycin, 125 U/l \nFungizone, 2.2 g/l sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine \nserum (FBS) pretreated by 5% charcoal-dextran, in a 5% CO2 \nincubator. For experiments carried out in serum-free condi-\ntions, cells were made quiescent by culturing in serum-free \nmedium for 24 h. DMEM with antibiotics and glutamine, was \nsupplemented with 0.5 g/l BSA (1). Cells were randomly divided \ninto six groups and cultured for 48 h with E2 (17\u03b2-estradiol, \nat doses of 0 mol/l group, 10-9 mol/l group, 10-8 mol/l group, \n10-7 mol/l group, 10-6 mol/l group and 10-5 mol/l) to determine \nthe dose-dependent effects of E2 on mfn2 and cell behavior. \nCells of each group were cultured for 48 h in DMEM medium \ncontaining 10% FBS plus defferent dose of E2 without phenol-\nsulfonphthalein (2). To specially enhance mfn2 expression and \nexplore its effect on proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells, \ncells were randomly divided into four groups in gene trans-\nfection experiments as follows: normal group (blank control), \nuntransfected E2 group (E2), control vector pEGFP-transfected \nE2 group (E2 plus control vector) and pEGFP-mfn2-transfected \nE2 group (E2 plus mfn2 vector). Cells of the three groups treated \nwith E2 were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS plus 10-6 mol/l \nE2 for 48 h (3). To explore the effect of ER\u03b2 on mfn2 expres-\nsion, cells were randomly divided into four groups as follows: \nnormal group (blank control), untransfected E2 group (E2), \ncontrol vector pEGFP-N1 E2 group (E2 plus control vector) and \npEGFP-N1-ESR2 E2 group (E2 plus ER\u03b2 vector). Cells of every \ngroup were grown as described in group 2. Each experiment \nwas repeated six times.\n\nExpression vectors and transient transfection. The pEGFP-mfn2 \nand pEGFP-N1-ESR2 vectors and their negative control \nvectors were purchased from Yingrun Biotechnology Co. \nLtd., (Changsha, China). pEGFP-mfn2 and pEGFP-N1-ESR2 \nplasmids carry full-length mfn2 and ER\u03b2 genes, respectively. \nTransient transfection of MCF-7 cells was carried out using \nLipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA) \naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MCF-7 \ncells were cultured in 6-well plates and the medium was changed \nthe following day until 80% confluence was achieved. The cells \nwere transfected with 4.0 \u00b5g vector DNA by 10 \u00b5l Lipofectamine \n2000 in 2 ml serum-free DMEM medium. At 6 h after transfec-\ntion, the medium was replaced by normal DMEM supplemented \nwith 10% FBS, and cells were cultured for 24 h. Cells were then \ncultured for 48 h in medium containing 10% FBS and E2 to \ndetect proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells (group 2) and \nmfn2 expression (group 3). The efficiency of transfection was \napproximately 70% for all experimental groups.\n\nWestern blot analysis. Protein extracted from MCF-7 cells \nwas separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred \nonto PVDF membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, \nUSA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at 37\u02daC with 5% BSA \nin Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST). \nNext, the membrane was incubated at 4\u02daC overnight with \nprimary antibodies for mfn2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, \nSanta Cruz, CA, USA), ER\u03b2 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), \nand \u03b2-actin (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Subsequently, \nthe membrane was rinsed three times with TBST containing \nsecondary antibody (1:5,000), treated with ECL solution (Pierce, \nRockford, IL, USA), and bands detected by exposing the blots \nto X-ray film. For quantitative analysis (i.e., normalized for \n\u03b2-actin), bands were evaluated with IPP 5.0 software. Integrated \noptical density (IOD) of each band was measured, and relative \nIOD calculated as the ratio of the target band IOD compared to \nthe IOD of the \u03b2-actin band.\n\nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with \nTRIzol (Invitrogen Co.) according to the manufacturer's \ninstructions. Total RNA (2 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed using \nrandom primers and M-MLV at 42\u02daC for 1 h and then heated \nto 94\u02daC for 5 min in a total reaction volume of 20 \u00b5l. The \nPCR amplification began with a 5-min denaturation at 95\u02daC, \nfollowed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u02daC for 45 sec, \nannealing at 55\u02daC for 45 sec and extension at 72\u02daC for 60 sec. \nThe final extension was set for 10 min at 72\u02daC. The products \nwere electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the levels of \nmfn2 mRNA were normalized with levels of GAPDH mRNA. \nAll PCR primers are shown in Table I.\n\nImmunofluorescence. MCF-7 cells were planted on cover \nslides in 6-well plates. After fixing with 10% formalin at room \ntemperature for 15 min, pretreating with 0.3% Triton X-100 for \n20 min at 37\u02daC and blocking with goat serum for 30 min at \n37\u02daC, cells were incubated with anti-mfn2 (1:200) overnight at \n4\u02daC. After washing with PBS for three times, the slides was all \nincubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, \nSanta Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 37\u02daC. Then slides were \nviewed after being rinsed with PBS three times.\n\nCell proliferation. Cell proliferation was measured using \nmethyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) shade selection experi-\nments.

The figure analysis was carried out by \nthe software of IPP. The quantitative data are presented as \nmean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD).

Statistical differences were \nconsidered significant at a P-value of <0.05.\n\nResults\n\nE2 downregulates expression of mfn2 in a dose-dependent \nmanner in MCF-7 cells. As described above, the ER might regu-\nlate mfn2 expression via a non-classical pathway. To observe the \neffect of ER\u03b1 on mfn2, MCF-7 cells, which primarily express \nER\u03b1, were cultured in medium containing E2. The effect of E2 \non mfn2 expression through ER\u03b1 was measured using immu-\nnoblotting for protein levels and semi-quantitative RT-PCR for \nmRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. E2 inhibited the expression of \nmfn2 in a dose-dependent manner. Mfn2 was expressed at a \nhigher level in cells cultured with 10% FBS. When cells were \npretreated with 10-9 mol/l, 10-8 mol/l, 10-7 mol/l, 10-6 mol/l \nand 10-5 mol/l group E2 for 48 h, protein expression of mfn2 \ndecreased by 2.85, 40.00, 55.43, 74.29 and 57.14%, respectively. \nThus, the lowest expression of mfn2 was seen in the 10-6 mol/l \ngroup. Similar changes were seen when cells were analyzed by \n\nRT-PCR. These findings demonstrated that E2 decreased mfn2 \nexpression in a dose-dependent manner at both the molecular \nand protein levels (Fig. 1).\n\nE2 enhances proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells. \nMCF-7 cells are the best-characterized ER-positive cell line \nin terms of known genes regulated by estrogens that promote \nproliferation. In order to confirm that E2 promotes prolif-\neration, E2-treated MCF-7 cells were examined using an \nMTT assay. Absorbance of the MTT substrate at 490 nm for \neach dosage group is showed in Table II. Significant differ-\nences were seen among experimental groups and the control \ngroup; the maximum effect of E2 on proliferation was seen in \nthe 10-6 mol/l group, where mfn2 was expressed at its lowest \nlevel. These results demonstrated that E2 treatment resulted \nin increased proliferation of MCF-7 cells, and that decreased \nmfn2 might play a positive role in this proliferation.\n\nTo determine if E2 influenced cell motility, we examined \nthe ability of treated cells to migrate in a wound-healing assay. \nIn response to wounding the monolayer, the 10-6 mol/l group \ncells were able to almost completely heal the wound. In contrast, \nthe cells of other groups were unable to do so and exhibited \nan obvious reduction in their rate of migration compared to \nthe 10-6 mol/l group. As compared with the 10-6 mol/l group \ncells, the reduction in the migration rate of cells treated with \nE2 at 10-9 mol/l, 10-8 mol/l, 10-7 mol/l, 10-5 mol/l and 0 mol/l \nwere 64.3, 50.0, 31.4, 24.5 and 85.7%, respectively. These \nresults demonstrated that E2 also enhanced cell motility in a \ndose-dependent manner (Fig. 2).\n\nThe mfn2 expression vector effectively suppressed E2-induced \nupregulation of PCNA and migration in MCF-7 cells. A \nprevious study demonstrated that mfn2 profoundly suppresses \n\nFigure 1. E2 downregulates expression of mfn2 in a dose-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells.

To investigate the \n\ninvolvement of mfn2 in E2-induced cell proliferation and \nmigration, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the expression \nvector pEGFP-mfn2. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, normal \ncultured MCF-7 cells (C) had standard expression levels of \nmfn2 and PCNA. However, both untransfected MCF-7 cells \nstimulated with 10-6 mol/l E2 (E2), and control vector trans-\nfected cells stimulated with 10-6 mol/l E2 (E2+C) showed \nnotably decreased mfn2 expression and enhanced PCNA \nexpression. In comparison with MCF-7 cells transfected with \ncontrol vector, mfn2 levels were increased by 2.11-fold and \nPCNA levels were decreased by about 42.61% in MCF-7 cells \ntransfected with specific mfn2 expression vector (E2+mfn2) \n(P<0.01). Consistent with the western blot analysis results, \nimmunofluorescence also revealed that the mfn2 vector \nreversed E2-induced downregulation of PCNA protein \n(Fig. 3C and D).\n\nCells transfected with the mfn2 vector showed moderate \nresistance to E2 stimulation. In comparison with E2-stimulated \nuntransfected or control vector-transfected cells, mfn2 expres-\nsion vector-transfected cells demonstrated decreased cell \nmigration (Fig. 4). The wound-healing assay indicated that \nMCF-7 cells and control vector-transfected cells stimulated \nby E2 almost completely healed the wound, as compared with \nunstimulated cells. However, this alteration was reversed by \ntransfection with the mfn2 expression vector.\n\nER\u03b2 ameliorates E2-induced mfn2 downregulation in MCF-7 \ncells. As stated previously, estrogen's effects are mediated \nthrough two ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (3-6). We hypothesized that \nER\u03b2 might also act upstream of mfn2, because mfn2 is identi-\ncally regulated by E2. To test our hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were \ntransfected with an ER\u03b2 expression vector. As seen in Fig. 5, \nMCF-7 cells transfected with the ER\u03b2 vector showed high ER\u03b2 \nprotein expression after stimulation with E2 for 24 h. However, \nno changes in ER\u03b2 protein levels were found in MCF-7 cells \ntransfected with blank control vector or in untransfected MCF-7 \ncells. In comparison with MCF-7 cells transfected with blank \nvector, ER\u03b2 protein was increased by about 2.25-fold in MCF-7 \ncells transfected with the ER\u03b2 vector (P<0.01). Cells transfected \nwith the ER\u03b2 vector showed antagonistic effects on E2 stimula-\ntion; mfn2 protein was upregulated in these cells as compared \nwith blank vector-transfected MCF-7 cells and untransfected \ncells treated with E2. These results indicated that MCF-7 cells \ntransfected with the ER\u03b2 vector showed moderate resistance to \nE2 stimulation and subsequent decreased downregulation of \nmfn2 protein (Fig. 5).\n\nAn ER\u03b2 expression vector effectively suppressed E2-induced \nenhancement of proliferation and migration in MCF-7 cells. \nThe results above showed that mfn2 negatively regulated \nE2-induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells and \nER\u03b2 acted as an upstream signal of mfn2; therefore, we hypoth-\nesized that ER\u03b2 could also inhibit proliferation and migration of \nMCF-7 cells. To investigate this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were \ntransfected with the ER\u03b2 expression vector (pEGFP-N1-ESR2). \nAn MTT assay was used to examine the proliferation of MCF-7 \ncells. As shown in Table III, there were significant differences \nof absorbance of MTT substrate at 490 nm between experi-\nmental groups and the control group.

In fact, the wound-healing assay indicated that MCF-7 \ncells stimulated by E2 and cells transfected with control vector \nexpressed a stronger ability to heal the wound as compared with \nnormal group cells untreated with E2. However, this ability was \nreversed by transfection with the ER\u03b2 vector.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt is acknowledged that ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 have distinct roles in \nbreast cancer cells. Although the majority considered that ER\u03b1 \npromotes proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells \nand the function of ER\u03b1 had been clearly elucidated, the exact \nroles of ER\u03b2 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer are unclear. \nIn fact, the function of ER\u03b2 in the pathogenesis and develop-\nment of breast cancer is contradictory. Some studies indicate \nthat ER\u03b2 may function as a tumor suppressor and that the loss \nof ER\u03b2 may promote breast carcinogenesis (16-18); however, \nthere are other studies suggesting that ER\u03b2 may promote cell \nproliferation and breast tumor formation (19,20). Regardless of \nthese contradictions, the majority of studies focus on the clas-\nsical model of estrogen signaling through ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, \nin which ERs act at ERE-containing promoters. In the classical \nmodel, ligand-activated ER binds specifically to DNA at EREs \nthrough its DNA binding domain and brings coactivators and \ncorepressors to the transcription site via its activator function \n(AF)-1 and AF-2 domains. However, an increasing number of \nstudies show that estrogen also modulates gene expression by \na second mechanism in which the ER interacts with other tran-\nscription factors through a process referred to as transcription \nfactor cross-talk. In this case, the ER modulates the activities \nof other transcription factors such as activator protein (AP)-1, \nor SP-1 by stabilizing their binding to DNA and/or recruiting \ncoactivators to the complex (21,23). DeNardo et al (14) reported \na model of estrogen-ER activation of AP-1 through interac-\ntion with existing coactivator complexes that in turn stabilize \nthe entire complex and/or induce this complex into a higher \nstate of activity. They also identified 6 estrogen-induced/AP-1 \ndependent genes, including mfn2, which might fit this model. \nHowever, their conclusions were only speculative, as they did \nnot provide detailed data or investigated the interaction of ERs \nand mfn2 in vitro. In this study, we investigated the role of \nER\u03b2 in estradiol-induced proliferation and migration of human \nbreast cancer cells and studied whether mfn2 participated in \nthis behavior.\n\nFirst, we explored whether E2 (17\u03b2-estradiol) affected prolif-\neration and migration of MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer cell \n\nline primarily expressing ER\u03b1 and thus mimicking the majority \nof ER-positive breast tumors. Similar to some previous studies \nthat revealed that E2 affected biological behavior of human \nbreast cells (24-26), our results showed that both the proliferation \nand migration abilities of MCF-7 were significantly increased \nwhen cultured with increasing doses of E2. Furthermore, regula-\ntion was in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximum effect \nseen in the 10-6 mol/l group. These data suggest that E2 and ER\u03b1 \nare positive regulators of MCF-7 cells.\n\nWhether mfn2 was involved in the initiation and progres-\nsion of human breast cancer has not been previously reported. \nTo investigate the role of mfn2, we observed the expression of \nmfn2 in MCF-7 cells cultured within defferent doses of E2. \nInterestingly, we found that E2 could decrease mfn2 expression \nin a dose-dependent manner, and that the changes in mfn2 levels \nwere correlated with the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 \ncells. These results indicated that mfn2 might negatively regulate \nestradiol-induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells. \nFurthermore, we found that introduction of mfn2 blocked the \nresponse of MCF-7 cells to E2. Thus, mfn2 plays an important \nregulatory role in E2-induced proliferation and migration of \nMCF-7 cells. Considering the reports that mfn2 is one of the \nestrogen-induced/AP-1 dependent genes (14), the above results \nsuggested that mfn2 might negatively regulate E2-induced \nMCF-7 cell proliferation and migration by a non-classical \npathway. Mfn2, a proliferation-inhibiting gene, targets to the \nouter membrane of mitochondria. The mfn2 gene was found \nto play roles in the inhibition of cellular proliferation and the \npromotion of apoptosis (10) and exhibits antitumor activity in a \nwide range of cancer cell lines (27-29), suggesting that mfn2 may \nbe important in the development of human cancers. Again, the \npresent study also provided a potential target for prevention or \ntreatment for breast cancer patients with ER\u03b1 positive expression.\n\nApproximately 70% of breast tumors express ER\u03b2, and \nmost tumors coexpress both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (30,31). However, \nwhether ER\u03b2 is involved in E2-induced downregulation of \nmfn2 is still unknown. Clearly, additional studies are needed to \nclarify the role of ER\u03b2 in breast cancer. In the present study, we \nintroduced ER\u03b2 into MCF-7 cells and investigated the effects \nof ER\u03b2 on proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells as well \nas its effects on mfn2 expression. Our studies demonstrate that \nER\u03b2 changes the phenotype of MCF-7 cells in response to E2. \nIn ER\u03b1-expressing MCF-7 cells, E2 causes proliferation and \nmigration, as well as suppression of mfn2. In contrast, when \nER\u03b2 is expressed along with ER\u03b1, MCF-7 cells are directed to \nantitumor pathways and high levels of mfn2 even in the pres-\nence of estrogens. These results suggest that ER\u03b2 can alter the \nresponse of MCF-7 to estrogens and demonstrate that ER\u03b2 may \nfunction as a tumor suppressor through the mfn2 pathway. Many \ncell-based studies suggest that ER\u03b2 acts as a negative modulator \nof ER\u03b1 action. When ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are co-transfected into ER \nnegative (ER-) cells, ER\u03b2 inhibits ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity \nand decreases the sensitivity of the cells to E2 (6,32). ER\u03b2 also \nlowers both ER\u03b1 mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7 cells, thus \nindirectly influencing function of ER\u03b1 (33,34). ER\u03b2 overexpres-\nsion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells can not only inhibit ER\u03b1 \nregulation of a subset of genes involved in DNA replication, \ncell-cycle regulation, and proliferation (35,36), but also \ninhibit cell proliferation in response to E2 (34,36-38), in part \nby increasing expression of antiproliferative genes (p21Cip1 \n\nTable III.

Our results were quite similar to these reports, \nand minor deference lie in downstream factors. There may \nbe diverse mechanisms for the effect of ER\u03b2 on the response \nof ER\u03b1 to E2. Recently, some studies revealed in series that \nthe responses of breast cancer cell lines to 17\u03b2-estradiol are \ndependent on the ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 ratio (39,40). Most importantly, \nER\u03b2 might regulate mfn2 expression directly in a non-clas-\nsical pathway similar to ER\u03b1. Therefore, further studies are \nneeded to determine the exact mechanisms of interaction \nbetween ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, and mfn2, especially to delin-\neate the mechanism of action through experiments such as \nin-depth promoter analysis and CHIP.\n\nReferences\n\n  1.

To elucidate the functions of CARM1 in tumorigen-\nesis, we knocked out CARM1 from several breast cancer cell lines using Zinc-Finger Nuclease technology,\nwhich resulted in drastic phenotypic and biochemical changes. The CARM1 KO cell lines enabled identifica-\ntion of CARM1 substrates, notably the SWI/SNF core subunit BAF155. Methylation of BAF155 at R1064 was\nfound to be an independent prognostic biomarker for cancer recurrence and to regulate breast cancer cell\nmigration and metastasis. Furthermore, CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation affects gene expression by\ndirecting methylated BAF155 to unique chromatin regions (e.g., c-Myc pathway genes). Collectively, our\nstudies uncover a mechanism by which BAF155 acquires tumorigenic functions via arginine methylation.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCoactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1),\n\nalso known as PRMT4, is a type I protein argininemethyltransfer-\n\nase (PRMT) that asymmetrically dimethylates protein substrates\n\non arginine residues. CARM1 was originally identified as a coac-\n\ntivator for steroid hormone receptors (Chen et al., 1999). CARM1\n\nknockout (KO) mice die at birth (Yadav et al., 2003), showing\n\nthat CARM1 is specifically required for postnatal survival. Inter-\n\nestingly, methyltranserase-inactivated CARM1 knockin mice\n\nphenocopy CARM1 null mice, indicating that CARM1 requires\nSignificance\n\nAlthough mutations or epigenetic changes inactivating and al\nSNF are frequently linked to cancer, the mechanisms underlyin\nand pathways that induce SWI/SNF\u2019s oncogenic effects would\ndriving changes while retaining SWI/SNF\u2019s normal functions. H\nstrate for arginine methyltransferase CARM1. Methylation of B\ndrive regulation of genes in the c-Myc and certainmetastatic pa\nremodeling factor is activated by arginine methylation to regu\nits enzymatic activity for the majority, if not all, of its in vivo func-\n\ntions (Kim et al., 2010).\n\nEmerging evidence implies oncogenic functions of CARM1 in\n\nhuman cancer. CARM1 transactivates many cancer-associated\n\ntranscription factors including NF-kB, p53, E2F1, and steroid\n\nreceptors such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERa; Bedford and\n\nClarke, 2009), and promotes cancer cell proliferation (El Mes-\n\nsaoudi et al., 2006; Frietze et al., 2008). Recent tissue microarray\n\nstudies revealed that CARM1 expression is higher in metastatic\n\nbreast tumors than in normal breast tissues (Mann et al., 2013),\n\nparticularly in triple negative tumors lacking expression of ERa,\ntering the functions of chromatin remodeling complex SWI/\ng these connections remain unclear. Delineating the factors\nenable preventive and therapeutic targeting of these cancer-\nere, we identify BAF155, a SWI/SNF core subunit, as a sub-\nAF155 is required for its association with genomic sites that\nthways. This represents amechanismbywhich a chromatin-\nlate genes that enhance tumor progression and metastasis.\n\nCancer Cell 25, 21\u201336, January 13, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. 21\n\nmailto:wxu@oncology.wisc.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2013.12.007\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2013.12.007&domain=pdf\n\n\nFigure 1.

These results imply that\n\naltered CARM1expression may underlie pathological conditions\n\nand that, in breast cancer, CARM1 has roles beyond serving as a\n\ncoactivator for ERa. It remains to be determined whether the\n\noncogenic functions of CARM1 depend on its ability to regulate\n\ncancer-driving transcription factors or to directly methylate can-\n\ncer-relevant substrates, or both.\n\nThe significance of identifying cancer-relevant CARM1 sub-\n\nstrates is underscored by studies of the roles of histone H3\n\nmethylation in transcriptional activation of ER target genes (Wu\n\nand Xu, 2012). Nonhistone substrates include p300/CBP,\n\nAIB1/SRC-3, and RNA binding proteins such as PABP1, HuR,\n\nHuD, and HnRNPs (Bedford and Clarke, 2009). Multiple lines of\n\nevidence indicate that normal CARM1 expression is well above\n\nthat required for its essential roles. For instance, normal develop-\n\nmental functions were maintained in genetically engineered\n\nCARM1 hypomorphic mice with only 25% of the wild-type\n\n(WT) CARM1 level (Kim et al., 2010). We recently showed that\n\nknocking down 90% of endogenous CARM1 in MCF7 cells\n\nonly slightly reduces methylation of PABP1 (Zeng et al., 2013).\n\nThese results imply that even greatly depleted CARM1 catalytic\n\nactivity and substrate methylation are sufficient to maintain\n\nmajor biological functions. Previously, CARM1 null mouse em-\n\nbryonic fibroblast cell lysates were used as a hypomethylated\n\nsubstrate source that led to identifying PABP1 as a CARM1 sub-\n\nstrate (Lee and Bedford, 2002). The CARM1 null cancer cell lines\n\nwould greatly facilitate identifying cancer-relevant substrates\n\nand understanding of CARM1 oncogenic functions in breast\n\ncancer cells. Herein, we generated CARM1 KO cancer cell lines\n\nand used them to explore the roles of BAF155 methylation by\n\nCARM1 in breast cancer models.\n\nRESULTS\n\nGeneration of CARM1 KO Breast Cancer Cell Lines\nUsing ZFN Technology\nWe recently developed a sensitive methylated PABP1 (me-\n\nPABP1) western blot method to monitor endogenous CARM1\n\nlevels and activity (Zeng et al., 2013). In contrast to the complete\n\nloss of me-PABP1 in CARM1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n\n(CARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEFs; Figure 1A, lanes 1 and 2), we found that\neven though small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown\n\ndecreased CARM1 levels by 90%, the cellular me-PABP1 level\n\ndecreased by less than 20% (Figure 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Thus,\n\nlow levels of CARM1 are capable of substantial PABP1 methyl-\n\nation. Because CARM1 substrates therefore should remain\n\nsignificantly methylated in CARM1 knockdown cells but be hy-\n\npomethylated in CARM1 null cells, we generated CARM1 null\n\ncancer cell lines to identify cancer-relevant CARM1 substrates.\n\nWe utilized Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) technology to create a\n\nhighly specific genomic scissors targeting exon 8 of CARM1\n\n(Figure 1B), and through this generated a complete KO in cancer\n\ncell lines. After transient transfection of ZFN plasmids into cells,\n\nwe performed limiting dilution to select single clones and\n(F) Western blot of CARM1, PABP1, and me-PABP1 in MCF7, two MCF7 CA\n\nretroviral infection.\n\n(G) Representative cell morphology images of MCF7 cells, MCF7-shCARM1 cell\n\nSee also Figure S1.\nconfirmed CARM1 KO by loss of me-PABP1 (Figure 1C) and\n\ngenomic DNA sequencing (Figure 1D). Representative KO\n\nclones with complete depletion of me-PABP1 are shown in Fig-\n\nure 1C for MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and human embryonic kidney\n\n293T (HEK293T) cell lines. The human CARM1 gene locus\n\nresides at chromosome19 p13.2, a region triplicated in MCF7\n\nand duplicated in MDA-MB-231 cells. The genomic DNA\n\nsequencing analysis of two representative CARM1 KO clones\n\nof MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1D) revealed misrepaired\n\nDNA, resulting in mRNA degradation and gene deletion.\n\nAlthough the efficiency of ZFN KO varied among cell lines\n\nat 1.3%, 0.5%, and 3.6% for MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and\n\nHEK293T, respectively, the average KO efficiency across all\n\nclones analyzed was 1.2% (Figure 1E). When CARM1was re-ex-\n\npressed in two individual MCF7 CARM1 KO clones, me-PABP1\n\nwas restored (Figure 1F). Interestingly, we found that KO of\n\nCARM1 in MCF7 cells inducedmorphology changes (Figure 1G),\n\nwhereas nomorphology changewas observed inMCF7 cells ex-\n\npressing CARM1 shRNA to knock down CARM1 to 10% of WT\n\nlevels (Figure 1G). The morphology change in the two KO clones\n\nwas rescued by re-expressingWTCARM1 (Figure 1G) but not an\n\nenzyme-defective mutant (data not shown). We compared the\n\nin vitro cell growth and in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-231\n\nCARM1 KO and MCF7 CARM1 KO with their parental cells. KO\n\nof CARM1 impeded cell growth and colony formation (Figures\n\nS1A and S1B available online) and tumor growth in vivo (Fig-\n\nure S1C). These data strongly suggest that the cell morphology\n\nchange and growth defect in KO cells could be due to loss of\n\nmethylation of CARM1 substrates.\n\nIdentification of BAF155 as a Substrate for CARM1\nThe lack of understanding of the biological functions of CARM1\n\nin cancers is at least partially attributed to the limited number of\n\nknown CARM1 substrates. A few CARM1 substrates were previ-\n\nously identified or validated by comparing CARM1+/+ and\n\nCARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEF cell lysates for in vitro and in vivo methylation\n(Cheng et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2004). In contrast to CARM1-\n\nexpressing cells, where potential CARM1 substrates would be\n\nblocked for further methylation, CARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEF lysates served\nas a hypomethylated substrate resource for CARM1 substrate\n\nidentification. Indeed, we found that MCF7 CARM1 KO cell\n\nlysates were more strongly methylated in vitro by recombinant\n\nCARM1 protein than CARM1\ufffd/\ufffd MEF cell lysates, as assayed\nby 3H-CH3 labeling in an autoradiograph (Figure S2A) and west-\n\nern blotting using a newly developed asymmetrically dimethy-\n\nlated arginine (a-ADMA) antibody (Dhar et al., 2013; Figure S2B).\n\nThis result implies that MCF7 CARM1 KO cells serve as a good\n\nresource for substrate discovery.\n\nWhen cell lysates derived from parental MCF7 cells and\n\nCARM1 KO cells were probed with monomethylated arginine\n\n(a-MMA) and a-ADMA antibodies in western blots, asymmetri-\n\ncally dimethylated proteins, in particular those in the high mo-\n\nlecular weight range, were significantly affected by CARM1\n\nKO (Figure 2A). This is in contrast to the lack of a significant\nRM1 KO clones, and MCF7 CARM1 KO clones re-expressing CARM1 by\n\ns, and the MCF7-derived CARM1 KO cell lines listed in (F).

In order to identify CARM1\n\nsubstrates in breast cancer cells, we used the a-ADMA anti-\n\nbody to immunoprecipitate proteins from cell lysates derived\n24 Cancer Cell 25, 21\u201336, January 13, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc.\nfrom parental MCF7 cells expressing WT CARM1 and MCF7\n\nCARM1 KO cells, respectively. The discrete bands in WT cells\n\nstained with Coomassie blue were excised and subjected to\n\n\n\nCancer Cell\n\nCARM1 Methylates BAF155 to Promote Tumorigenesis\nmass spectrometry, from which ten candidate proteins were\n\nidentified (Figure 2B). To discern whether these proteins are\n\nCARM1 substrates, we immunoprecipitated endogenous pro-\n\nteins (BRG1, BAF170, BAF155, and BAF250) or FLAG-tagged\n\nproteins (TRAP150, Caprin 1, TRAP230, and BCLAF1) tran-\n\nsiently transfected to MCF7 WT or KO cells, and followed\n\ntheir fate in western blots using a-ADMA or a-FLAG antibody,\n\nrespectively.\n\nWestern blot results using a-ADMA antibody (Figure 2C)\n\nclassified the candidate proteins into three categories. The first\n\ncategory includes BAF155 and TRAP230 proteins, which are\n\ndimethylated in WT but not in KO MCF7 cells, indicating that\n\narginine dimethylation of these proteins is CARM1 dependent.\n\nThe second category includes Caprin1 and BCLAF1 proteins,\n\nwhich are dimethylated in WT and KO cells at similar levels,\n\nindicating that CARM1 is not their sole methyltransferase.\n\nFinally, the third category includes BAF170, BRG1, BAF250,\n\nand TRAP150 proteins, which are not recognized by a-ADMA\n\nantibody, suggesting that they were immunoprecipitated by\n\nthe a-ADMA antibody via indirect association with bone fide\n\nCARM1 substrates (e.g., BRG1, BAF250, and BAF170 are in\n\ncomplex with methylated BAF155). Although the a-ADMA anti-\n\nbody recently developed by Cell Signaling appeared sensitive\n\nin detecting CARM1 substrates, this antibody has not been\n\nextensively characterized (Dhar et al., 2013).\n\nSince a previous study had reported that a histone H3 argi-\n\nnine17 dimethylation (H3R17me2) antibody, while recognizing\n\nthe H3R17me2 mark, also recognized other CARM1 substrates\n\nin MEF cells (Cheng et al., 2007), we employed this anti-\n\nH3R17me2 antibody for western blotting (Figure S2C, left panel)\n\nand immunoprecipitation, followed by Coomassie blue staining\n\n(Figure S2C, right panel), using total cell lysates from MCF7\n\nWT and KO cells. Similar to the pattern detected by a-ADMA\n\nantibody, the recognized proteins specific to CARM1 WT but\n\nnot CARM1 KO cells reside in the high molecular weight range,\n\namong which BAF155 was identified using mass spectrometry\n\n(Figure S2C). Correspondingly, one strong band (Figure S2D,\n\narrow head) migrating between 130 and 250 kDa was detected\n\nby a-ADMA antibody in the a-H3R17me2 immunoprecipitates\n\nfrom WT but not KO MCF7 cell lysates. This band was subse-\n\nquently proved to be BAF155 by reciprocal immunoprecipitation\n\nusing H3R17me2 and BAF155 antibodies (Figures S2E and S2F).\n\nCollectively, BAF155 appeared to be amain substrate of CARM1\n\nin MCF7 cells detected by both a-ADMA and H3R17me2\n\nantibodies.\n\nTo address whether BAF155 ismethylated by CARM1 directly,\n\nwe performed in vitro methylation assays using recombinant\n\nCARM1 and hypomethylated BAF155 purified from HEK293T\n\nCARM1 KO cells in the presence of adenosyl-L-methionine,\n\nS-[methyl-3H] (3H-SAM). As expected, BAF155 was methylated\n\nby CARM1 in vitro (Figure 2D). Finally, we demonstrated that\n\nBAF155 methylation could be restored in HEK293T CARM1\n\nKO cells by expressing WT CARM1 but not a methylation-\n\ndefective mutant (Figure 2E). These results collectively\n\ndemonstrate that CARM1 is both necessary and sufficient to\n\nmethylate BAF155. In keeping with this finding, CARM1 was\n\nfound to be the only PRMT among PRMT family members\n\n(PRMT1\u2013PRMT8) that is capable of methylating BAF155\n\nin vitro (Figure S2G).\nCARM1 Methylates BAF155 at a Single Site, R1064\nAlthough multiple CARM1 substrates were discovered using the\n\na-ADMA antibody and CARM1 KO cell line (Figure 2B), we chose\n\nto focus on BAF155 because BAF155, a core subunit of switch/\n\nsucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling com-\n\nplex, has been reported upregulated in colon, cervical, and pros-\n\ntate cancer (Lapointe et al., 2004; Tomlins et al., 2007; Varambally\n\net al., 2005). Using PMeS (Shi et al., 2012), an online tool for pre-\n\ndicting protein methylation sites based on an enhanced feature-\n\nencoding scheme, five putative arginine methylation sites were\n\npredicted on human BAF155 (Table S1). Based on the putative\n\nmethylation sites, a full-length and four C-terminally truncated\n\nBAF155 derivatives with C-terminal myc tags were constructed\n\n(Figure 3A). These plasmids were transiently transfected into\n\nHEK293T cells, and the resulting proteins were immunopreci-\n\npated using a-myc antibody and western blotted with a-ADMA\n\nantibody (Figure 3B). Notably, full-length BAF155 but none\n\nof the truncated BAF155 proteins was detected by a-ADMA\n\nantibody, suggesting that the BAF155 methylation site follows\n\nresidue 956. We then individually mutated C-proximal R1032\n\nand R1064 to lysine in FLAG-tagged expression plasmids.\n\nAfter transient expression and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation,\n\nFLAG-BAF155R1032K but not FLAG-BAF155R1064K protein was\n\ndetected by a-ADMA antibody in vivo (Figure 3C). Similarly, the\n\nrecombinant BAF155R1064K mutant protein was not methylated\n\nby recombinant CARM1 in vitro (Figure 3D). Thus, R1064 is the\n\nonly BAF155 site methylated by CARM1.\n\nAntibodies against endogenous CARM1 or BAF155 each\n\nimmunoprecipitated both proteins from MCF7 cell lysates\n\n(Figure 3E), suggesting that CARM1 and BAF155 may directly\n\ninteract. To map the BAF155 region mediating association with\n\nCARM1, we linked each of a series of BAF155 truncation deriv-\n\natives (Chen and Archer, 2005) with a T7 promoter and FLAG\n\ntag (Figure 3F) for in vitro transcription/translation assays. As\n\nshown in Figure 3F, full-length BAF155 and its C-terminally trun-\n\ncated (D1, D2, D3 and D4) but not N-terminally truncated (D5, D6\n\nand D7) derivatives bound strongly to bacterially expressed\n\nglutathione S-transferase CARM1 (GST-CARM1). Thus, the\n\nacidic domain at the BAF155 N terminus mediates interaction\n\nwith CARM1, although R1064, the site of methylation, localizes\n\nto the BAF155 C terminus. R1064 of human BAF155, located\n\nin the evolutionarily conserved proline- and glutamine-rich (P/\n\nQ-rich) domain, is conserved among higher eukaryotes (Fig-\n\nure 3G). BAF170, while sharing 61.7% protein sequence identity\n\nwith BAF155, lacks an arginine residue at a position equivalent\n\nto R1064 in its corresponding P/Q-rich domain (Figure 3H).\n\nThis explains why BAF170, a close homolog of BAF155, is not\n\na substrate for CARM1 (Figure 2C).\n\nThe Majority of Endogenous BAF155 in MCF7 Cells Is\nDimethylated\nTo investigate the prevalence of endogenous BAF155 dimethy-\n\nlation in breast cancer cells, we generated a rabbit polyclonal\n\nantibody specific for dimethylated BAF155 (Figure S3A). This\n\nme-BAF155 antibody detects methylation of endogenous\n\nBAF155 in WT MCF7 cells but not in two MCF7 CARM1 KO\n\nclones (Figure S3B). Similar to PABP1 (Figure 1A), me-BAF155\n\nwas still detectable in MCF7-shCARM1 cells (Figure S3C).

Moreover, BAF155 and\n\nme-BAF155 immunofluorescence were confined to the nucleus\n\n(Figure S3E). Since the majority of endogenous BAF155 is dime-\n\nthylated, we went on to study the role of BAF155 methylation in\n\nhuman breast cancer cells.\n\nBAF155 Methylation at R1064 Creates Unique\nChromatin Association Patterns\nBAF155, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodel-\n\ning complex, was shown to associate with chromatin depen-\n\ndently or independently of other SWI/SNF subunits using\n\nchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in HeLa\n\ncells (Euskirchen et al., 2011). Accordingly, we decided to deter-\n\nmine the effect of BAF155 methylation on its chromatin associa-\n\ntion. First, to substitute endogenous BAF155 with BAF155R1064K\n\nmutant, we infected MCF7 cells with retrovirus vectors express-\n\ning either WT BAF155 (BAF155WT), mutant BAF155R1064K, or\n\nGFP as a negative control (Figure 4A). After confirming that\n\nthe resulting total BAF155 level was twice the endogenous\n\nBAF155 level, we stably knocked down endogenous BAF155 us-\n\ning a lentiviral-expressing shRNA, which selectively targets the\n\n30UTR of the endogenous, but not the lentiviral-expressed,\nBAF155 mRNA. Figure 4A shows that BAF155 was silenced\n\nin MCF7-GFP cells, and that MCF7-BAF155WT and MCF7-\n\nBAF155R1064K cells express reconstituted BAF155WT and\n\nBAF155R1064K proteins to levels similar to that of endogenous\n\nBAF155 protein in the parental MCF7 cells. Interestingly,\n\nsubstituting endogenous BAF155 with BAF155R1064K, like\n\nBAF155 knockdown, significantly reduced colony size (Fig-\n\nure 4B, lower panels) and yield (Figure 4C), while cell morphology\n\nwas not changed (Figure 4B, upper panels). To investigate\n\nwhether BAF155 methylation by CARM1 is required for\n\nCARM1-induced colony formation in MCF7 cells, we first stably\n\noverexpressed BAF155WT and BAF155R1064 in MCF7 CARM1\n\nKO cells, respectively, followed by knocking down the endo-\n\ngenous BAF155 in these cells using lentivirus-expressing\n\nshBAF155. Subsequently CARM1 was restored in MCF7\nFigure 3.

Restoring CARM1 in\n\nBAF155WT-expressing but not BAF155R1064K-expressing cells\n\nrescued colony formation in terms of both colony size and yield\n\n(Figures 4E and 4F). These results further support that BAF155\n\nmethylation affects the cellular functions of BAF155.\n\nTo ensure that BAF155 methylation does not affect its assem-\n\nbly into the SWI/SNF complex, we expressed BAF155WT and\n\nBAF155R1064K in SKOV3, an ovarian cancer cell line that ex-\n\npresses all SWI/SNF components except BAF155 (DelBove\n\net al., 2011). As shown in Figure S4, immunoprecipitating\n\neither BAF155WT or BAF155R1064K effectively pulled down other\n\nSWI/SNF components such as BRG1, BAF60a, and BAF47\n\nin SKOV3 cells. Only BAF155WT, but not BAF155R1064K, was\n\nmethylated by endogenous CARM1, as revealed by a-ADMA\n\nimmunoblot (Figure S4A). Thus, both CARM1-methylated\n\nand -unmethylated BAF155 assemble into SWI/SNF complexes.\n\nNext we determinedwhethermethylation of BAF155 affects its\n\nchromatin association, using a genomic ChIP-seq approachwith\n\nMCF7-BAF155WT and MCF7-BAF155R1064K cells. A ChIP-grade\n\nBAF155 antibody (Euskirchen et al., 2011) was used for ChIP fol-\n\nlowed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Representative\n\nBAF155WT, BAF155R1064K, and BRG1 binding sites in HeLa\n\nand MCF7 cells in a 7.5 Mb region of chromosome 8 are shown\n\nin Figure 4G. As expected, while some BAF155WT peaks identi-\n\nfied in MCF7 cells overlap with the binding sites of BAF155 and\n\nBRG1 in HeLa cells (Figure 4G, box a; Euskirchen et al., 2011),\n\nBAF155WT also has unique binding sites in MCF7 and HeLa cells\n\n(Figure 4G, box d). We subsequently analyzed the genome-wide\n\ndistribution of BAF155 binding peaks in MCF7 expressing WT or\n\nmutant BAF155. Totals of 2,667 and 1,566 peaks were identified\n\nfor BAF155WT or BAF155R1064K, respectively. Among these, 983\n\npeaks overlapped (Table S2). The numbers of annotated genes\n\nin the genomic regions associated with these BAF155WT and\n\nBAF155R1064K binding sites are shown in Figure 4H. As in HeLa\n\ncells, approximately 60% of BAF155 binding sites in MCF7 cells\n\nreside in gene bodies (exons and introns; Figure 4I). Moreover,\n\nBAF155 peaks in MCF7 cells are enriched within +50 kb from\n\nthe transcription starting sites (TSSs), which are likely to contain\n\nenhancer regions (Figure 4J).

Next we performed conventional ChIP using distinct\n\nsets of biological samples to validate whether BAF155 is associ-\n\nated with the binding sites determined in the ChIP-seq experi-\n\nment. As shown in Figure 5A, BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K\n\nwas found associated with the ChIP-seq-implicated regions\n\nof CDCA7, COL1A2, GADD45A, DDX18, and NDRG1, whereas\n\nboth BAF155 forms were detected at the promoter region of\n\nCDH1. ChIP using the me-BAF155 antibody confirmed the\n\nassociation of me-BAF155 to COL1A2 and GADD45A genes\n\nin MCF7-BAF155WT but not in MCF7-BAF155R1064K cells (Fig-\n\nure 5B). Importantly, BAF155 association strongly correlated\n\nwith gene expression. COL1A2 and GADD45A mRNA levels,\n\nfor example, were higher in MCF7-BAF155WT than in MCF7-\n\nBAF155R1064 or MCF7-GFP with endogenous BAF155 silenced\n\n(Figure 5C). To examine whether the association of BAF155\n\nwithCOL1A2 andGADD45A genes depends on CARM1 expres-\n\nsion, we performed ChIP assays in parental MCF7 and CARM1\n\nKO cells. As shown in Figures 5D and 5F, CARM1 KO resulted\n\nin significant decreases of BAF155 association with the impli-\n\ncated regions of COL1A2 and GADD45A. Thus, CARM1 is an\n\nimportant determinant for BAF155 genomic association, and\n\nCARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation could induce BAF155\n\nassociation with unique genomic sites to control gene regulation.\n\nInterestingly, we could not detect binding above background\n\nof CARM1, BAF53, or SWI/SNF adenosine triphosphatase\n\n(ATPase) subunits BRG1 and BRM at the same regions of the\n\nCOL1A2 and GADD45A genes where BAF155 binds (Figures\n\n5E and 5G), although BRG1 could be detected at positive control\n(C) Colony yields for the cell lines in (B).\n\n(D) Western blotting analysis of CARM1, BAF155, and me-BAF155 proteins in MC\n\nBAF155R1064K cells engineered to express either GFP or CARM1. b-Actin was us\n\n(E) Representative images of colonies formed by each cell line shown in (D).

Despite\n\nthe lack of detectable binding of BRG1 to COL1A2, GADD45A,\n\nand NDRG1 regions (Figure S5D), SNF5 but not BAF53 was\n\nfound at the BAF155-binding sites (Figures 5E, 5G, and S5D)\n\nof the corresponding genes. Accordingly, methylated BAF155\n\nmight be in a subcomplex with other BAFs such as SNF5 at\n\nunique chromatin sites.\n\nBAF155 Methylation Correlates with Human Breast\nCancer Progression and Malignancy\nTo determine whether me-BAF155 could serve as a prognostic\n\nbiomarker for human breast cancer, we first optimized the\n\nme-BAF155 peptide antibody for immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\nIHC staining of me-BAF155 could be completely blocked by\n\nme-BAF155 peptide but not by nonmethylated BAF155 peptide\n\n(Figure S6A), showing that the me-BAF155 antibody is specific.\n\nWe next performed IHC using total BAF155 antibody as well\n\nas me-BAF155 antibody with four pairs of matched breast\n\nnormal and tumor samples. As shown in Figure S6B, me-\n\nBAF155 staining was almost undetectable in normal samples,\n\nwhile both total BAF155 protein level and me-BAF155 intensity\n\nwere elevated in breast tumors. Notably, CARM1 protein levels\n\nalso were elevated in tumors relative to matched normal tissues\n\n(Figure S6C).\n\nThese results suggest that the increased level of me-\n\nBAF155 in tumors reflects overall elevated levels of BAF155\n\nand CARM1. Thus, the me-BAF155 level might be a sensitive\n\nbreast cancer progression biomarker. To test this hypothesis,\n\nwe employed commercial tissuemicroarrays (TMAs), which con-\n\ntained\ufffd80 samples from normal tissues, tumor-adjacent normal\n(TAN), benign tumors, malignant tumors, and metastatic tumors\n\nexcised prior to treatment. Modest me-BAF155 staining was\n\nseen with normal (Figure 6A), TAN, and benign tissues (Fig-\n\nure 6B). In contrast, significantly greater me-BAF155 IHC\n\nstaining was observed with malignant and metastatic tumors.\n\nOne hundred percent of metastatic tumors (6/6) showed strong\n\npositive staining for me-BAF155 (Figures 6C and 6D). To investi-\n\ngate if BAF155 methylation status is associated with clinical\n\noutcomes, we employed TMAs containing 372 breast tumor\n\nspecimens with 150 months of clinical follow-up.

The Kaplan-Meier\n\nplot shows that the me-BAF155-negative patients have a higher\n\nrecurrence-free survival rate than do me-BAF155-positive\n\npatients (Figure 6E). A log-rank test performed to formally test\n\nthis difference in recurrence-free survival rates yielded a statisti-\n\ncally significant p value of 0.0497. Notably, the results of the\n\nmultivariate analyses performed using the Cox proportional\n\nhazards model indicate a recurrence hazard 1.789 times higher\n\nfor patients with me-BAF155-positive tumors when compared\n\nwith me-BAF155-negative tumors (p = 0.034; Figures 6F and\n\n6G). This hazard ratio of 1.789 for me-BAF155-positive tumors\n\nis similar to that of triple-negative breast cancer (hazard ratio =\n\n1.845), a category well known for its poor prognosis. This differ-\n\nence in recurrence hazard rates is shown in the cumulative\n\nhazard plot (Figure 6F). These data underscored the potential\n\nuse of me-BAF155 as a biomarker of malignant breast cancer\n\nand also in prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients.\n\nMethylation of BAF155 Promotes Migration and\nMetastasis of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo\nTo investigate of the role of BAF155 methylation in tumor migra-\n\ntion and metastasis, we employed MDA-MB-231, an aggressive\n\nbreast cancer cell line model, for in vitro transwell migration and\n\nin vivo metastasis studies. Using a strategy similar to that for\n\nMCF7 cells (Figure 4A), we engineered stable cell line MDA-\n\nMB-231-GFP with endogenous BAF155 knockdown, and its\n\nreconstituted derivatives MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT and MDA-\n\nMB-231-BAF155R1064K (Figure 7A). Knockdown of endogenous\n\nBAF155 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased cell\n\ngrowth (Figure 7B, compare - with ,), which was rescued by\n\nrestoring BAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K (Figure 7B, compare\n\n: with 6). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous BAF155\n\nin MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased cell migration in\n\ntranswell assay, an effect that was partially rescued by restoring\n\nBAF155WT but not BAF155R1064K (Figure 7C). To explore the\n\npossibility that methylation of BAF155 is required for establishing\n\nmetastatic lung colonization in vivo, we injected MDA-MB-\n\n231-BAF155WT and MDA-MB-231-BAF155R1064K cells stably\n\nexpressing firefly luciferase intravenously to nude mice and\n\nmonitored tumor cell colonization and outgrowth in lung using\n\nbioluminescence imaging.

BAF155WT-expressing but not\n\nBAF155R1064K-expressing cells showed colonization and tumor\n\noutgrowth in lung (Figure 7D). Thus, BAF155 methylation is posi-\n\ntively linked to lung metastasis.\n\nTo gain further insight into the mechanism by which\n\nBAF155 methylation regulates MDA-MB-231 metastasis,\n\nwe employed the tumor metastasis RT2 profiler PCR array\n\n(SABiosciences), containing 84 genes involved in metastasis, to\n\ncompare the mRNA expression profiles between MDA-MB-\n\n231-BAF155R1064K and MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT (Figure 7E). If\n\nmore than 2-fold expression difference was seen between\n\nthe two cell lines, the corresponding genes are marked green\n\nor red (Figure 7E) and are listed in Figure 7F. Two metastasis\n\nrepressor genes, CDH11 and KISS1R, were upregulated,\n\nand six metastasis-promoting genes, CCL7, CDH6, COL4A2,\n\nCXCL12, MMP13, and MYCL1, were downregulated in MDA-\n\nMB-231-BAF155R1064K cells compared with BAF155WT cells.\n\nFour genes were selected for validation using real-time PCR.\n\nIndeed, KISS1R and CDH11 were expressed at higher levels in\n\nMDA-MB-231-BAF155R1064K cells, whereas CCL7 and COL4A2\n\nwere expressed at higher levels in MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT\n\ncells (Figure 7G). We further systematically compared the\n\ndifferential gene expression of MDA-MB-231-BAF155WT\n\nand -BAF155R1064K using Affymetrix microarrays. Over 700\n\ngenes were differentially expressed in two cell lines (p < 0.05);\n\n322 and 411 genes were upregulated and downregulated,\n\nrespectively (Figure S7A). Among other differential expressed\n\ngenes identified (Table S3), the metastasis genes COL4A2\n\nand TIMP3 (Figure 7F) and c-MYC pathway gene CDCA7 (Fig-\n\nure 5C) were expressed at higher levels in BAF155WT cells than\n\ninBAF155R1064K cells. Geneontology pathway analyses revealed\n\nthat themajor differentially expressed genes fall in the categories\n\nof cellular movement, cellular organization, cell proliferation,\n\nand migration (Figure S7B). Moreover, despite the different cell\n\nlines used to study gene expression andDNAbinding differences\n\nbetween WT BAF155 and BAF155R1064K, one-fourth of the\n\ndifferentially expressed genes identified by microarrays in\n\nMDA-MB-231 cells overlap with differentially bound genomic\n\nregions identified by ChIP-seq in MCF7 cells (Figure S7C). These\n\nresults suggest that BAF155 methylation regulates important\n\npathways involved in cancer progression, including cell move-\n\nment and migration.\nyc Pathway\n\nNDRG1 genes was analyzed using ChIP-quantitative PCR (qPCR) in MCF7-\n\ned similar binding to the positive control CDH1 gene.

This echoes the in vivo mouse model\n\nwhere reducing CARM1 to 25% of endogenous level still sus-\n\ntains normal development (Kim et al., 2010). Consistent with\n\nthis, CARM1 KO decreased cell and tumor growth in vitro and\n\nin vivo, in contrast to little in vivo growth effect of CARM1\n\nshRNA-mediated knockdown in MCF7 (Al-Dhaheri et al., 2011).\n\nWhile CARM1 knockdown may selectively affect methylation of\n\nsome substrates but not others, our findings underscore the\n\nimportance of using complete KOs when studying the biological\n\nfunctions of enzymes.\n\nAlthough engineered ZFNs have been used for genome editing\n\nin diverse model organisms, allele engineering in somatic cell\n\ngenetics has not been widely applied for determining enzyme\n\nfunctions. KO efficiency by ZFNs varies among cancer cell lines\n\nand depends on transfection efficiency and the multiplicity of the\n\ntargeted chromosome. For example, the CARM1 disruption fre-\n\nquency reached 10% of alleles in diploid breast cancer cell line\n\nCAL51 (data not shown), compared with 1.3% in MCF7 cells\n\nwhere CARM1-bearing chromosome 19 is triplicated. In fact,\n\none-time transient transfection of a plasmid encoding the\n\nCARM1 ZFN in MCF7 cells only disrupted CARM1 biallelically,\n\nas confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA. In agreement\n\nwith a report that sequential ZFN transfection of biallelically dis-\n\nrupted clones resulted in triple locus KO at frequency of 1% (Liu\n\net al., 2010), limiting dilution and genotyping without antibiotic\n\nselection yielded two MCF7 clones (out of 159) in which\n\nCARM1 was disrupted triallelically (Figure 1E). Despite low KO\n\nfrequency in some cases, ZFN-mediated KO of genes like\n\nCARM1 in cancer cell lines provides unprecedented opportu-\n\nnities for cancer-relevant substrate discovery since, for example,\n\nMEFs lack or express many CARM1 substrates at lower level\n\nthan CARM1 null cancer cell lines. Identifying cancer-relevant\n\nsubstrates for CARM1 is essential for elucidating its functions\n\nin cancer, as exemplified by BAF155.\n\nSWI/SNF is a multisubunit chromatin-remodeling complex\n\nthat has been strongly implicated in cancer development due\n\nto aberrant expression and mutation of its subunits in many\n\ntumor types (Weissman and Knudsen, 2009). Accompanying\n\nthe SWI/SNF ATPase subunits (e.g., BRG1) are 9\u201312 BAF\n\nproteins, including core and accessory subunits. The core\n\nsubunits, BAF155, BAF170, and SNF5 (also referred to as\n\nSMARCB1, BAF47, or SNF5/INI1), were defined on the basis\n\nof their ability to restore efficient nucleosome remodeling\n\nin vitro (Phelan et al., 1999). Recent whole genome sequencing\n\nof human tumors revealed that SWI/SNF subunits are mutated\n\nin >20% of human malignancies (Kadoch et al., 2013). For\nFigure 6.

Conflicting evidence suggests\n\nthat BAF155 may serve as tumor suppressor or oncogene\n\nin a tumor-type-specific manner. BAF155 was initially impli-\n\ncated as a tumor suppressor because of its residency in chro-\n\nmosome 3p21.31, a region frequently deleted in lung and\n\nother adenocarcinomas (Zabarovsky et al., 2002). Coincidently,\n\nBAF155 expression is deficient in two ovarian cancer cell\n\nlines, SKOV3 and SNUC2B (DelBove et al., 2011). However,\n\nmounting evidence supports that, for at least some tumor\n\ntypes, BAF155 might enhance tumor development. BAF155\n\nexpression is markedly induced in prostate cancer (Lapointe\n\net al., 2004), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (Shadeo et al.,\n\n2008), and colon cancer (Andersen et al., 2009). Elevated\n\nBAF155 expression was correlated with poor prognosis and\n\nrecurrence in colon cancer (Andersen et al., 2009). The varied\n\nBAF155 expression in distinct tumor types suggests that aber-\n\nrant BAF155 levels may contribute to tumor initiation and pro-\n\ngression in a context-dependent manner.\n\nWe report here that BAF155 is elevated in human breast\n\ntumors and that increased methylation of BAF155 is associated\n\nwith poor survival, implicating BAF155 as an independent prog-\n\nnosis biomarker. Individual ChIP experiments showed that some\n\ngenomic sites seem to bind BAF155 independently of BRG1.\n\nFurther ChIP-seq to improve signal/noise ratios and mapping\n\nof genomic sites using anti-me-BAF155 and BRG1 antibodies\n\nwill more fully test BRG1-independent binding of BAF155 to\n\nchromatin sites. Nonetheless, our results support that methyl-\n\nated BAF155 might have functions independent from the full\n\nSWI/SNF complex, which agrees with earlier reports that individ-\n\nual SWI/SNF subunits confer oncogenic functions independently\n\nof the entire complex (Park et al., 2002). For example, BAF53\n\nformed a distinct complex with c-Myc cofactors, including\n\nhistone acetyltransferases to enhance c-Myc\u2019s oncogenic trans-\n\nformation activity (Park et al., 2002). It remains unknown whether\n\nme-BAF155 and SNF5 form complexes distinct fromSWI/SNF at\n\ngenomic loci specific for me-BAF155, including c-Myc pathway\n\ngene loci.\n\nThe c-Myc pathway deregulation is a common feature of\n\nhuman tumorigenesis. The Myc oncoprotein provides selective\n\nadvantages to cancer cells by promoting proliferation, cell sur-\n\nvival, genetic instability, and differentiation blockage, which\n\nall contribute to metastasis. This study reveals that methylated\n\nBAF155 is specifically recruited to c-Myc pathway genes,\n\nsome of which are direct c-Myc targets (e.g., GADD45A) and\n\nsome of which are not (e.g., COL1A2). COL1A2 produces a\n\ncomponent of type I collagen, the pro-a2 (I) chain, involved in in-\n\nflammatory response pathways. COL1A2 was among a \u2018\u2018meta-\n\nsignature\u2019\u2019 associated with breast cancer prognosis (Urquidi\n\nand Goodison, 2007).

Depending on the oncogenic\n\nstress, GADD45A could function as promoter or suppressor for\n\nbreast cancer (Tront et al., 2010). GADD45A promotes tumor\n\nvascularization and growth of Myc-driven breast cancer via\n\nnegative regulation of MMP10 (Tront et al., 2010).\n\nRecently, \u2018\u2018poor prognosis\u2019\u2019 gene expression signatures in\n\ncancer, particularly in breast cancer, were found to reflect the\n\nactivity of the c-Myc oncoprotein, which in turn regulates tumor\n\nmetastasis through regulation of metastasis-relevant target\n\ngenes and/or globally altering the epigenomic landscape of\n\ncancer cells (Wolfer et al., 2010). BAF155 methylation affects\n\nexpression of a number of genes involved in metastasis. Inter-\n\nestingly, another study using the MDA-MB-231 cell line model\n\nshowed that c-Myc knockdown had modest effects on primary\n\ntumor growth, whereas metastatic behavior and distant lung\n\nmetastasis were greatly inhibited (Wolfer et al., 2010). This\n\nstudy suggests that c-Myc is essential for maintaining an inva-\n\nsive and migratory state of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231\n\ncells. Future studies will determine whether BAF155-methyl-\n\nation-sensitive metastatic genes are directly regulated by\n\nc-Myc. Given that 10%\u201315% of genomic loci in mammals are\n\nbound by c-Myc (Zeller et al., 2006), it is plausible that c-Myc\n\naffects metastasis-relevant gene expression via direct tran-\n\nscriptional regulation mechanism or via global alteration of\n\nchromatin structure of cancer cells, thus promoting the meta-\n\nstatic phenotype.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nGeneration of CARM1 KO Cells\n\nCells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated ZFN\n\npairs using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 72 hr. Single-cell clones were\n\nisolated by limiting dilution of the ZFN-treated pool. The whole cell lysate of\n\neach clone was collected and CARM1 levels were detected by western blot.\n\nTo analyze genomic DNA sequences of each positive clone, the target\n\nlocus was first amplified by PCR using primers CARM1-ZFN-sense: 50-\nACAGCCTGCCTTCTCAGG-30, anti-sense: 50-TGCACAGCAATGGCAAGT-30.\nThen the PCR product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector.

Upon light exposure, activated rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) in\nDrosophila PRs is internalized via endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Whether internalized Rh1 can be recycled is\nunknown. Here, we show that the retromer complex is expressed in PRs where it is required for recycling endocytosed Rh1\nupon light stimulation. In the absence of subunits of the retromer, Rh1 is processed in the endolysosomal pathway, leading\nto a dramatic increase in late endosomes, lysosomes, and light-dependent PR degeneration. Reducing Rh1 endocytosis or\nRh1 levels in retromer mutants alleviates PR degeneration. In addition, increasing retromer abundance suppresses\ndegenerative phenotypes of mutations that affect the endolysosomal system. Finally, expressing human Vps26 suppresses\nPR degeneration in Vps26 mutant PRs. We propose that the retromer plays a conserved role in recycling rhodopsins to\nmaintain PR function and integrity.\n\nCitation: Wang S, Tan KL, Agosto MA, Xiong B, Yamamoto S, et al.

Because vision is not required for animal survival, previous\n\nstudies in Drosophila mostly focused on viable mutations that\n\nspecifically impair PR function [1]. However, it is likely that\n\nnumerous additional players encoded by essential genes have\n\nremained unidentified. We performed an eye-specific mosaic\n\ngenetic screen [6] and found that loss of subunits of the retromer\n\ncauses light-induced PR degeneration.\n\nThe retromer, a hetero-multimeric protein complex, re-\n\ntrieves specific proteins from endosomes, thereby preventing\n\nthe degradation of these proteins in lysosomes [7\u20139]. The\n\nretromer is composed of Vps26, Vps29, Vps35, and certain\n\nsorting nexins (Snx) (Figure 1A, [7\u20139]). Most subunits are\n\nevolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7\u20139]). Mutations in some\n\nsubunits (Vps35 or Snx3) of the retromer have been shown to\n\ndecrease the abundance of Wntless (Wls) and impair the\n\nsecretion of Wingless (Wg), a ligand of the Wnt signaling\n\npathway [10\u201314]. Wls is a transmembrane protein that binds\n\nto Wg and is required for Wg secretion [15,16]. Impaired\n\nretromer function leads to excessive degradation of Wls in\n\nlysosomes, severely reducing Wg secretion and signaling [10\u2013\n\n14]. The retromer has also been shown to maintain the levels\n\nof Crumbs, a transmembrane protein required for maintaining\n\nthe apicobasal polarity in some tissues [17,18]. More recently,\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001847&domain=pdf\n\n\nmutations in human VPS35 have been shown to cause a\n\ndominant inherited form of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) [19,20].\n\nHowever, the retromer has not been implicated in neurons of\n\nthe visual system in flies or vertebrates.\n\nThe Drosophila compound eye comprises ,800 hexagonal units\nnamed ommatidia [1,2,21,22]. Each ommatidium contains eight\n\nPRs (R1\u2013R8) that express rhodopsin proteins [1,2,21\u201323].\n\nRhodopsin 1 (Rh1) is the major rhodopsin that is primarily\n\nexpressed in R1\u2013R6 [1,2,21,22]. It is synthesized and folded in the\n\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to rhabdomeres, the\n\nstacked membranous structures in PRs, via the secretory pathway\n\n[1,2,21]. The proper transport of Rh1 from ER to rhabdomeres\n\nrequires molecular chaperones [24\u201330] and Rab GTPases [24\u2013\n\n33]. Binding of opsins to chromophores [34\u201340] as well as protein\n\nglycosylation and deglycosylation [41\u201344] are essential for Rh1\n\nfolding and maturation. Mutations in genes involved in Rh1\n\nsynthesis, folding, or transport can result in defective PR\n\ndevelopment or PR degeneration [24,25,32,41\u201343,45\u201351].\n\nPhototransduction in the PRs relies on the activation of Rh1 by\n\nphotons (Figure S1A, [52]). Active Rh1 (metarhodopsin, M*)\n\nactivates phospholipase C (PLC) [53], which hydrolyzes phospha-\n\ntidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol\n\n(DAG) [54]. DAG or its metabolites can activate Transient\n\nReceptor Potential (TRP) and TRP-like cation channels that lead\n\nto depolarization of the PRs [55\u201359]. Similar to fly PRs, the\n\nvertebrate intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells\n\n(ipRGCs) use melanopsin (a homolog of fly Rh1) as the light\n\nsensor and requires PLC and TRPC channels for activation [60\u2013\n\n63]. ipRGCs project their axons to specific brain areas to control\n\ncircadian rhythms [64\u201367] or pupillary light reflex [64,68,69].\n\nTight regulation of Rh1 activity upon light exposure is required\n\nto maintain the integrity of PR cells [1,2]. M* can be converted\n\ninto its inactive form upon exposure to orange light [52]. In\n\naddition, a significant portion of active Rh1 can be endocytosed\n\nand degraded in lysosomes [70\u201372]. Mutations that abolish Rh1\n\ndeactivation [72\u201374] or impair the endolysosomal system\n\n[71,75,76] can cause PR degeneration due to Rh1 accumulation.\n\nHowever, it is unknown whether Rh1 can be retrieved from the\n\nendolysosomal compartments and whether impaired Rh1 recy-\n\ncling leads to PR degeneration.\n\nHere, we show that loss of the fly Vps26 or Vps35 causes early-\n\nonset PR degeneration. We show that retromer subunits are\n\nexpressed in PRs in flies and melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs in the\n\nmouse retina. In fly mutant PRs, the numbers of late endosomes\n\nand lysosomes are significantly elevated. The PR degenerative\n\nphenotypes are dependent on exposure to light and the presence of\n\nRh1. Our data indicate that the fly retromer recycles Rh1,\n\npreventing Rh1 retention in the PR cell bodies and shunting Rh1\n\nfrom being degraded in lysosomes, thereby promoting Rh1\n\nredelivery to rhabdomeres. In summary, the retromer recycles\n\nRh1, prevents an overload of the endolysosomal pathway, and\n\nsalvages a substantial fraction of Rh1 from degradation in flies. It\n\nmay also play a similar role in ipRGCs in the retina of vertebrates.\n\nResults\n\nVps26 Mutant PRs Display Light-Dependent PR\nDegeneration\n\nTo identify mutations that cause PR degeneration, we\n\ngenerated large mutant clones of essential genes in the eyes\n\n(Figure S1B) and screened for mutants that exhibit an age-\n\ndependent decrease in amplitude of electroretinogram (ERG)\n\nrecordings [6,77,78]. Mutations in a complementation group\n\nXE52, which we later mapped to Vps26 (Figure S2A), result in a\n\nprogressive loss of ERG amplitudes compared to the control\n\n(Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). Reduced amplitudes in ERG\n\nrecordings may result from aberrant PR development, a defective\n\nphototransduction pathway, or PR degeneration [1]. To address if\n\nthe ERG defects are due to aberrant PR development, we\n\nexamined the light response of dark-reared control (y w FRT19Aiso,\n\nthe isogenized y w FRT19A flies, or iso; see Materials and Methods)\n\nand two Vps26 mutant alleles. Upon rearing the flies in the dark,\n\nthe Vps261 and Vps262 mutants exhibit nearly normal ERG\n\nresponses and the ERG amplitude and on- and off-transients in\n\nVps261 mutant PRs are slightly reduced when compared to control\n\n(Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). In addition, imaging of newly\n\neclosed flies (see definition in Materials and Methods) revealed that\n\nthe overall morphology of ommatidia is similar to control,\n\nalthough loss of a rhabdomere is observed at low frequency in\n\nthe Vps261 mosaic clones (Figure 1D\u2013E and Figure S1D\u2013E). These\n\ndata indicate that mutations in Vps26 do not significantly affect PR\n\ndevelopment, allowing nearly normal ERGs in young flies.\n\nTo assess the impact of the Vps26 mutations in aged flies, we\n\nraised the animals either in a 12-h light/dark cycle (LD, L = 1,800\n\nlux) or in constant darkness (DD) and recorded the ERGs at 0, 2,\n\n4, 10, and 21 d. In LD, both alleles show a loss of on- and off-\n\ntransients, indicating a loss of synaptic transmission. They also\n\nexhibit a reduced depolarization by day 2, and a progressive loss of\n\nthe ERG amplitude with age (Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). At\n\nday 21, the light-induced PR depolarization in Vps261 and Vps262\n\nmutant PRs is almost completely absent (Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure\n\nS1C). Strikingly, 3-wk-old DD-reared Vps261 and Vps262 mutants\n\nexhibit nearly normal ERG responses, similar to newly eclosed\n\nflies (Figure 1B\u2013C and Figure S1C). The PR morphology of\n\nVps261 and Vps262 mutants is severely affected in flies kept in LD\n\nfor 21 d (Figure 1D\u2013E and Figure S1D\u2013E). In addition, we\n\nconstructed an EGFP-tagged genomic rescue construct (Vps26-\n\ngEGFP; see below and Figure S2A) that fully rescues the lethality\n\n(Figure S2B), ERG, and morphological defects of both Vps261 and\n\nVps262 alleles (Vps261 GR in Figure 1B\u2013E; Vps262 GR in Figure 1C\n\nand S1C\u2013E). However, PR morphology is nearly wild-type when\n\nthe flies are raised in DD (Figure 1D\u2013E and Figure S1D\u2013E). In\n\nsummary, PR degeneration in the Vps26 mutant clones is light-\n\ndependent.\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nUpon light exposure, rhodopsins\u2014light-sensing proteins\nin the eye\u2014trigger visual transduction signaling to\nactivate fly photoreceptor cells. After activation, rhodop-\nsins can be internalized from the cell surface into\nendosomes and then degraded in lysosomes. This mech-\nanism prevents constant activation of the visual transduc-\ntion pathway, thereby maintaining the function and\nintegrity of photoreceptor cells. It is not known, however,\nwhether these internalized rhodopsins can be recycled.\nHere, we show that the retromer, an evolutionarily\nconserved protein complex, is required for the recycling\nof rhodopsins. We find that loss of key retromer subunits\n(Vps35 or Vps26) causes rhodopsin mislocalization in the\nphotoreceptors and severe light-induced photoreceptor\ndegeneration. Conversely, gain of retromer subunits can\nalleviate photoreceptor degeneration in some contexts.\nHuman retromer components can stand in for depleted\nfruit fly retromer, suggesting that this complex plays a role\nin recycling light sensors in both vertebrate and inverte-\nbrate photoreceptors.\n\nThe Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847\n\n\n\nMutations in XE52 Map to Vps26\nTo identify the mutations in XE52 complementation group\n\nconsisting of two alleles, we performed duplication, deficiency, and\n\nP[acman] rescue mapping (Yamamoto et al., in preparation),\n\nnarrowing the locus to a 21 kb genomic region (Figure S2A). The\n\nXE52 alleles fail to complement the lethality of P{EP}Vps26G2008\n\n(Figures S2A\u2013B, [79]), a transposable element inserted in the 59-\n\nUTR of the Vps26 gene. Sanger sequencing revealed mutations in\n\nconserved amino acid residues in both alleles: a nonsense mutation\n\n(K264*) and a missense mutation (V267D) in Vps261 and Vps262,\n\nrespectively (Figure 1F). To test if Vps26 is responsible for both the\n\nlethality and PR degenerative phenotypes in XE52 alleles, we\n\ngenerated the Vps26-gEGFP genomic rescue construct mentioned\n\nabove (Figure S2A) as well as a UAS-Vps26 full-length cDNA\n\nconstruct [80].

However,\n\nthe in vivo subcellular localization of the retromer in Drosophila has\n\nnot been documented. We therefore raised a polyclonal antibody\n\nagainst the full-length fly Vps26 protein (Figure S2D\u2013E) and\n\ncostained with antibodies against Avalanche (Avl, fly homolog of\n\nSyntaxin 7, an early endosomal marker, [84]), Rab5 (an early\n\nendosomal marker, [85]), Rab7 (a late endosomal marker, [76]),\n\nProtein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI, an ER marker, [86]), GM130 (a\n\ncis-Golgi marker, [87]), Peanut Agglutinin (PNA, a marker for the\n\ntrans-Golgi network (TGN), [88]), or Rab11 (a TGN or post-Golgi\n\nsecretory vesicle marker, [31]). Vps26 shows substantially greater\n\ncolocalization with Avl, Rab5, and Rab7 than the ER, Golgi, and\n\nsecretory vesicle markers (Figure S2F\u2013G). This distribution is seen\n\nin both wing discs and adult PRs (Figure S2F\u2013G and unpublished\n\ndata), indicating that Vps26 associates preferentially with early and\n\nlate endosomes in different tissues in vivo.\n\nLoss of Vps35 Causes PR Degeneration\nVps35 acts as a scaffolding protein and physically interacts with\n\nVps26 in the retromer (Figure 1A, [81,82,89]). RNAi knockdown\n\nof vps35 has been shown to reduce Vps26 protein levels in\n\nHEK293 cells [13]. Consistent with work in cultured cells, we find\n\nthat mutant clones of the Vps35 null allele (Vps35MH20, [13]) in eye\n\ndiscs cause a nearly complete loss of Vps26 (Figure 2A), showing\n\nthat the presence of Vps35 is required for Vps26 in vivo. Next, we\n\nperformed ERG recordings and bright field imaging on large\n\nmutant clones of Vps35MH20 in flies aged for 0, 4, 10, and 21 d and\n\nexamined function and morphology of Vps35MH20 mutant PRs. As\n\nshown in Figure 2B\u2013C, the ERG phenotypes of Vps35MH20 are\n\nvery similar to those of Vps26 shown in Figure 1. In addition,\n\nmutations in the two genes exhibit very similar morphological\n\ndefects in aged PRs (compare Figure 2D\u2013E with Figure 1D\u2013E and\n\nFigure S1D\u2013E). These results indicate that the retromer is required\n\nto maintain PR function and morphology. Loss of the retromer\n\ntherefore leads to light-dependent PR degeneration.\n\nSorting nexins can be involved in retromer-mediated protein\n\ntrafficking [7\u20139,90,91]. To test whether these proteins are involved\n\nin the maintenance of PRs, we performed ERGs on Snx1d1 and\n\nSnx3d1 null alleles (Figure S3, [10]). Upon keeping the flies for 10 d\n\nin LD, we did not observe a difference in ERG amplitudes of\n\nSnx1d1 or Snx3d1 mutants (Figure S3A\u2013B), although we observed a\n\npartial loss of the on-transient in Snx3d1 (Figure S3A,C). The data\n\nindicate that these sorting nexins are not part of the complex or\n\nplay a minor role. In addition, we tested whether the WASH\n\n(Wiskott\u2013Aldrich Syndrome protein and SCAR Homolog) com-\n\nplex, a protein complex that has been shown to be required for the\n\ntransport of several retromer cargos in vertebrate cells and the fly\n\ntracheal tubes [8,90,91], is involved in PR degeneration. As shown\n\nin Figure S4, RNAi-mediated loss of a subunit of the WASH\n\ncomplex, Washout (the single WASH ortholog in Drosophila, [92]),\n\ndoes not affect PR maintenance and function. Hence, the retromer\n\ncan have different compositions in different cells.\n\nLoss of Retromer Subunits Leads to an Expansion of the\nEndolysosomal Compartments in PRs\n\nThe retromer retrieves membrane protein cargos from the\n\nendolysosomal pathway [7\u20139]. To assess whether endosomes and\n\nlysosomes are affected in the absence of the retromer, we\n\nperformed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and examined\n\nthe ultrastructure of Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs. Vps261 and\n\nVps35MH20 flies raised in LD for 4 d show obvious ultrastructural\n\ndefects (Figure 3B,D) in PRs when compared to control\n\n(Figure 3A). These defects include a dramatic increase in late\n\nendosomes (inset 1 in Figure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and yellow\n\narrowheads in Figure S5B,D; [93]) and lysosomes (inset 2 in\n\nFigure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and arrows in Figure S5B\u2013C,E; [94]).\n\nHowever, PRs of the dark-reared Vps261 or Vps35MH20 flies\n\n(Figure 3C,E\u2013F and Figure S6B\u2013E) do not show an increased\n\nnumber of late endosomes or lysosomes when compared to control\n\n(Figure 3A,F, Figure S5A, and Figure S6A). These data show that\n\nthe endolysosomal pathway is severely affected in retromer\n\nmutants upon light exposure.\n\nInternalized Rh1 Fails to Be Recycled from the\nEndolysosomal Pathway in Vps26 Mutant PRs\n\nTo address whether the trafficking of endocytosed Rh1 is\n\naffected in the retromer mutants, we assessed Rh1 distribution in\n\nPRs that were exposed to light. Two protocols have been used for\n\nRh1 immunostaining in fly PRs: whole mount preparations [76]\n\nand eye sections [41]. Previously, we showed that the whole mount\n\nprotocol is more sensitive than staining of sections for Rh1 present\n\nin the cell body, while sections are better than whole mount\n\nstaining for assessing Rh1 in rhabdomeres [6]. Here, we slightly\n\nmodified the whole mount protocol to increase Rh1 signals in the\n\nPR cell body by treating the tissues with higher concentrations of\n\nTriton X-100. As shown in Figure S7, Rh1 signals are obviously\n\nenhanced upon increasing Triton X-100 concentration (top\n\npanels) compared to low Triton X-100 treatment (bottom panels).\n\nHere, we use the high Triton X-100 protocol for our immuno-\n\nstaining assays.\n\nAs previously reported [6,76], immunostaining of Rh1 in dark-\n\nreared wild-type control PRs reveals a typical crescent-shaped\n\nstaining pattern at the base of the rhabdomeres, due to the densely\n\nstacked rhabdomeric membranes that do not permit antibody\n\npenetration in whole mount preparations (Figure 4A, top panels).\n\nSimilar to this control, we observed that the distribution\n\n(Figure 4A, top panels) and levels (Figure 5A\u2013B) of Rh1 are not\n\naffected in Vps261 mutants prior to light exposure. These data are\n\nin agreement with the observation that dark-reared Vps261\n\nmutants exhibit nearly normal ERGs and PR morphology\n\n(Figure 1B\u2013E). Upon a 12-h light exposure, Rh1 is internalized\n\nin both control and Vps261 mutant PRs, as shown by the dramatic\n\nincrease in Rh1 levels in the PR cell bodies (Figure 4A, middle\n\npanels). This increase in Rh1 is not due to the changes in levels of\n\nRh1 (unpublished data), but rather because Rh1 becomes\n\nthose in DD at the indicated time points.

In\n\naddition, this light exposure is not pathological as control flies\n\nexhibit normal ERGs and PR morphology (Figure S8). However,\n\nupon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is\n\nrestored to the original levels in control but not in Vps261 PRs\n\n(Figure 4A, bottom panels). Similarly, although less obvious, we\n\nalso observed Rh1 accumulation in Vps261 mutant PRs upon light\n\nexposure in the sectioned eye samples (Figure S9). Hence, the Rh1\n\nsubcellular localization is altered in Vps261 mutants.\n\nTo assess where in the cell body Rh1 accumulates in Vps261\n\nmutants, we transiently exposed the flies to light and monitored\n\nthe subcellular localization of Rh1 using markers. We briefly\n\nexposed the flies to blue light for 20 min followed by 5-min\n\nexposure to orange light (Figure 4B) to acutely induce endocytosis\n\nof a small amount of Rh1. This light condition is not pathological\n\nas the ERG responses and morphology of control PRs are normal\n\n(Figure S8). Upon recovery in the dark for 4 h, Rh1 can be\n\ndetected in very bright punctae that often colocalize with Rab7 or\n\nLamp1::GFP, a marker for lysosomes [95], in Vps261 PRs\n\n(Figure 4B\u2013C), implicating that Rh1 is trapped in the endolyso-\n\nsomal compartments.\n\nRh1 retention in the endolysosomal pathway in Vps261 mutants\n\nupon an acute light exposure may be due to reduced Rh1\n\nrecycling and/or decreased lysosomal degradation. If Rh1\n\nrecycling is decreased, one would expect a reduction in Rh1\n\nlevels in Vps261 mutants compared to controls upon light exposure\n\nas an increased amount of internalized Rh1 will be delivered to\n\nlysosomes for degradation. On the other hand, if Rh1 degradation\n\nin lysosomes is impaired, one would predict that Rh1 abundance is\n\nelevated in Vps26 mutant PRs when compared to controls exposed\n\nto light. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we exposed\n\nthe dark-raised flies to white light (1,800 lux) for 16 h. Prior to this\n\nlight exposure, the Rh1 levels are similar in control and Vps261\n\nmutants (Figure 5A\u2013B), indicating that Rh1 expression is not\n\naffected in Vps261 mutants. Upon a 16-h exposure to white light,\n\nRh1 levels in Vps261 mutant PRs are significantly decreased when\n\ncompared to control (Figure 5A\u2013B). Reduced Rh1 levels in Vps261\n\nmutants upon light exposure do not appear to be due to impaired\n\nRh1 synthesis as the Rh1 levels are restored after 6-h recovery in\n\nthe dark (Figure 5A\u2013B). Moreover, the ERG responses of Vps261\n\nmutants are not affected upon this light exposure (Figure 5C\u2013D).\n\nThe data indicate that, in the absence of Vps26, lysosomes are able\n\nFigure 3.

Dark-\nreared control (iso) or Vps261 mutants were kept in the dark, exposed to whole-spectrum light for 12 h, or exposed to light for 12 h and recovered in\nthe dark for 6 h. Both dark-reared control and Vps261 mutant PRs show a normal Rh1 distribution, which is characterized by the crescent-shaped Rh1\nstaining pattern surrounding rhabdomeres (marked by F-actin) (top panels). The localization of Rh1 in the shape of a crescent around the\nrhabdomeres is due to the dense packing of membranes in rhabdomeres. Upon a 12-h light exposure, both genotypes show increased Rh1 protein\nlevels in PR cell body (middle panels) as some Rh1 is endocytosed. However, upon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is higher\nin Vps261 than that in wild-type PRs (bottom panels). Scale bar, 2 mm.

However, chronic light exposure (LD for several\n\ndays) severely affects the endolysosomal system (Figure 3 and\n\nFigure S5) because accumulated Rh1 in endosomes and/or\n\nlysosomes persistently challenges the endolysosomal system [2].\n\nTo examine whether the retromer is recruited to Rh1 punctae\n\nupon endocytosis in the PRs, we performed colocalization studies\n\nof Vps26 and Rh1. In the dark, Rh1 and Vps26 signals do not\n\noverlap (Figure 5E). In contrast, numerous Rh1 punctae colocalize\n\nwith Vps26 in the PR cell body upon transient light exposure\n\n(Figure 5E). These data indicate that endocytosed Rh1 is a cargo\n\nof the retromer.\n\nReducing Endocytosis or Rh1 Levels Suppresses PR\nDegeneration in Vps26 Mutants\n\nIf PR degeneration in retromer mutants is caused by aberrant\n\naccumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal pathway, reducing the\n\namount of endocytosed Rh1 or the abundance of Rh1 itself may\n\nsuppress PR degenerative phenotypes. Dynamin (encoded by the\n\nshi gene) is required for Rh1 endocytosis upon light exposure [73].\n\nshits1, a temperature-sensitive dynamin allele, encodes a mutant\n\nprotein that is functional at 18uC but loses its function at elevated\ntemperature [96]. Although impaired dynamin function leads to\n\ndeath of adult animals at 26uC or higher temperature (unpub-\nlished data), shits1 mutant flies are viable and do not exhibit ERG\n\ndefects at 24uC (Figure 6A\u2013B). This permits us to conditionally\nreduce dynamin function in adult flies without impairing their\n\nlight response. To address whether internalization of Rh1 is\n\ncritical for the PR degeneration in Vps261 flies, we raised the\n\nVps261,shits1 double mutants at 18uC and shifted the newly eclosed\nflies to 24uC to decrease dynamin function. We then performed\nERGs on Vps261,shits1 double mutants kept in LD (Figure 6A). As\n\nshown in Figure 6A\u2013B, reducing dynamin function significantly\n\nsuppresses the loss in ERG amplitude in Vps261 mutants at day 4\n\nin LD, indicating that Rh1 endocytosis plays an important role in\n\nPR degeneration upon loss of retromer function.\n\nTo address if a reduction in Rh1 suppresses the demise of the\n\nPRs, we tested flies that lack one copy of the Rh1 gene. Strong\n\nhypomorphic or null Rh1 alleles impair rhabdomere development\n\nin homozygous animals, as Rh1 plays a key signaling role in\n\nmaintaining the structure of rhabdomeres [97,98]. However, flies\n\nthat are heterozygous for Rh1 loss-of-function alleles do not show\n\naberrant PR development even when the Rh1 protein levels\n\nare reduced by 50% (Figure S10 and [50]). To assess whether\n\na reduction of 50% in Rh1 levels is able to suppress the\n\nVps26-associated PR degenerative phenotypes, we tested ERGs\n\nin mutants that carry a single copy of the Rh1 null allele (ninaE17,\n\n[99]). As shown in Figure 6C\u2013D, flies that carry a single copy of\n\nRh1 exhibit a significant suppression of the ERG defects seen in\n\nVps261 mutant flies that have been kept in LD for 4 d.\n\nTo strongly reduce Rh1 levels, we next raised Vps261 mutants\n\non low vitamin A containing fly food. Vitamin A is a dietary\n\nprecursor of 11-cis 3-hydroxyretinal, the chromophore that is\n\ncovalently linked to the Rh1 opsin [100]. A decrease in vitamin A\n\nleads to loss of the chromophore. Because the chromophore is\n\nessential for Rh1 folding and stability [39,101], absence of vitamin\n\nA leads to reduced Rh1 levels in flies. Although this manipulation\n\nstill allows the formation of rhabdomeres, the size is dramatically\n\nreduced due to the requirement of Rh1 as a major structural\n\ncomponent [102]. Indeed, a reduction in dietary vitamin A leads\n\nto diminished rhabdomere size in both control and Vps261\n\nmutants. Remarkably, vitamin A deprivation leads to a very\n\nstrong suppression of the PR degeneration observed in Vps261\n\nmutants at day 10 in LD (Figure 6E\u2013F). In addition, the reduced\n\nERG amplitudes of Vps261 are strongly suppressed upon vitamin A\n\ndeprivation (Figure 6G). In summary, decreasing Rh1 levels\n\nsuppresses the retinal degeneration associated with Vps261. This\n\nalso suggests that elevated levels of Rh1 trapped in the\n\nendolysosomal pathway, rather than alterations in the levels of\n\nRh1 in the rhabdomeres per se, underlie PR degeneration in Vps261\n\nmutants.\n\nIncreased Levels of Vps35 or Vps26 Are Sufficient to\nSuppress PR Degeneration\n\nRh1 accumulation in late endosomes causes PR degenera-\n\ntion in flies that lack PLC activity (encoded by the no receptor\n\npotential A (norpA) gene, [76,103]) (Figure 7A). If the retromer\n\nretrieves Rh1 from endosomes, increasing retromer levels\n\nmight alleviate PR degeneration in norpA flies. We therefore\n\noverexpressed the fly Vps35 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps35,UAS-w\n\nRNAi) or Vps26 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps26,UAS-w RNAi) in nor-\n\npAP24 mutants. Upon continuous exposure to white light for\n\n6 d, norpAP24 mutants exhibit reduced numbers of rhabdomeres\n\ncompared to control flies (Figure 7B, left and middle left panels\n\nand Figure 7C). In addition, the ommatidia organization is\n\noften aberrant in norpAP24 mutants (Figure 7B, middle left\n\npanel), indicating that the PRs are undergoing a progressive\n\ndemise. Expression of Vps35 or Vps26 significantly restores\n\nrhabdomere numbers (Figure 7B, middle right and right panel\n\nand Figure 7C), suggesting that this manipulation is sufficient\n\nFigure 6. Decreasing Rh1 levels suppresses PR degeneration in Vps26 mutants. (A) Decreasing endocytosis with a temperature-sensitive\ndynamin mutation (shits) suppresses ERG defects associated with the loss of Vps26. Animals were grown at 18uC in the dark. Newly eclosed flies were\nselected and kept in the dark for an additional 12 h at 24uC to reduce dynamin function in shits1 or Vps261,shits1. Subsequently, flies are shifted to LD\nor kept in DD at 24uC. ERG is performed at the end of the fourth LD cycle. shits1 flies exhibit a normal ERG response. ERG defects in Vps261 mutant PRs\nare suppressed when dynamin function is partially reduced, as the Vps261,shits1 double mutants show a stronger depolarization than that in Vps261.\n(B) Quantification of ERG amplitude of the flies tested in (A).

Decreasing vitA lowers the levels of\nretinal, which is required for Rh1 maturation [39]. Loss of retinal therefore leads to loss of Rh1. Bright field images show that PR degeneration is\nstrongly suppressed in Vps261 mutants raised on the low vitA\u2013containing food when flies are kept in LD for 10 d. As vitA is a key component for Rh1\nmaturation and Rh1 is a key structural component of rhabdomeres, the rhabdomere size is much reduced when the flies were raised on low vitA\nfood.

In\n\naddition, expression of human Vps26B also suppresses the\n\nnorpAP24 phenotypes (unpublished data). These data indicate\n\nthat rerouting some of the Rh1 slated for lysosomal degrada-\n\ntion delays PR degeneration.\n\nMutations that impair lysosomal function can also lead to\n\nRh1-induced PR degeneration [76]. We therefore assessed\n\nwhether increasing Vps35 or Vps26 expression suppresses PR\n\ndegeneration in mutants that affect a subunit of the AP-3\n\ncomplex. AP-m3, encoded by carmine (cm), is required for the\nproper biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles [104]. Upon\n\n6 d of light exposure, cm1 mutant PRs showed degenerative\n\nfeatures [76], including loss of rhabdomeres and disruption of\n\nthe ommatidia organization (Figure 7D, bottom left panel and\n\nFigure 7E). In addition, cm1 mutant PRs exhibit decreased\n\nERG amplitudes (Figure 7F\u2013G). Similar to norpAP24 mutants,\n\nincreasing Vps35 or Vps26 in cm1 mutants restores the number\n\nof rhabdomeres (Figure 7D\u2013E) and suppresses ERG defects\n\n(Figure 7F\u2013G). These data indicate that increased retromer\n\nfunction can not only prevent PR degeneration in mutants with\n\nimpaired late endosomal trafficking but also suppress PR\n\ndegeneration caused by defective lysosomal function.\n\nVertebrate Retromer Homologs\nBecause the genes that encode the retromer proteins are\n\nevolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7\u20139]), we investigated\n\nwhether the vertebrate Vps26 and Vps35 may also function in\n\nthe visual system. As shown in Figure S11A, vps26A is expressed\n\nin the mouse retina based on Northern blots. In addition, we\n\nstained the retina of wild-type control or heterozygous mice\n\ncontaining a lacZ inserted in the vps35 gene [105]. Most of the\n\nmelanopsin-expressing ipRGCs (92%) also express b-GAL\n(Figure S11B). To test whether human Vps26 homologs can\n\nsubstitute for the function of fly Vps26 in PRs, we ubiquitously\n\nexpressed the human vps26A or vps26B cDNA in the Vps261\n\nmutant background. Both human Vps26A and Vps26B were able\n\nto rescue the lethality of Vps261 mutant flies (Figure 8A\u2013D). We\n\nalso recorded ERGs from adult flies kept in LD for 21 d. As\n\nshown in Figure 8A\u2013B, we observed a full rescue of the loss of\n\nERG amplitude and on\u2013off transients. In addition, PR degen-\n\neration in Vps261 mutants is fully suppressed by overexpressing\n\nhuman Vps26 proteins (Figure 8C\u2013D). These results show that\n\nthe human Vps26 homologs are able to perform the same\n\nfunction as the fly Vps26 protein.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Retromer Complex Is Required for Maintenance of\nFly PRs\n\nThe retromer recycles specific proteins from endosomes to the\n\nTGN or plasma membrane [7\u20139]. Here we show that, although\n\nthe loss of the retromer does not obviously affect eye development,\n\nmutations in Vps26 or Vps35 genes lead to strong light-dependent\n\nPR degeneration (Figure 1B\u2013E, Figure 2B\u2013E, and Figure S1C\u2013E).\n\nThe demise of Vps261 and Vps35MH20 PRs is associated with a\n\nsignificant increase in the number of late endosomes and\n\nlysosomes upon light exposure (Figure 3 and Figure S5), showing\n\nthat the endolysosomal pathway is strongly affected when Rh1\n\nrecycling by the retromer is impaired. Indeed, Rh1 accumulates in\n\nlate endosomes or lysosomes in the mutant PRs (Figure 4B\u2013C).\n\nAlthough Rh1 can be degraded and the function of Vps261 mutant\n\nPRs is not abolished upon short light exposure (Figure 5A\u2013D),\n\nchronic exposure to light is detrimental to Vps261 mutants because\n\npersistent Rh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal pathway is\n\ntoxic to PR cells [71,75,76]. Hence, reducing Rh1 endocytosis or\n\nRh1 levels in the rhabdomeres suppresses PR degeneration upon\n\nprolonged light exposure (Figure 6). Interestingly, increasing\n\nVps35 or Vps26 in mutants that show PR degeneration due to\n\nRh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal compartments [76]\n\nsuppresses the degenerative phenotypes (Figure 7). In summary,\n\nthe retromer is required to retrieve Rh1 from endosomes to\n\nmaintain PR function and integrity (Figure 8E).\n\nHow does Rh1 internalization affect the endolysosomal\n\npathway in retromer mutants? One possibility is that lysosomes\n\nin the mutants are unable to cope with the increased levels of\n\ninternalized Rh1 over time as Rh1 is one of the most abundant\n\nproteins in PRs [106,107]. This in turn triggers an increase in the\n\nnumber of lysosomes (Figures 3B,D,F and Figure S5B\u2013C,E), the\n\naccumulation of aberrant lysosomes (Figure S5C), and the\n\naccumulation of endolysosomal intermediates, including late\n\nendosomes (Figure 3B,D,F and Figure S5B,D). Alternatively, loss\n\nof the retromer may increase the flux in the endolysosomal\n\npathway, which overpowers the rate of endolysosomal maturation\n\nand leads to an adaptive response that eventually leads to the\n\nexpansion of these compartments. Both pathways can lead to an\n\napparent accumulation of Rh1 in the cell body when stained and\n\nanalyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4 and Figure S9).\n\nDefective regulation of Rh1 can lead to the demise of PRs via\n\napoptosis [72,108]. Does apoptosis play a critical role in the PR\n\nFigure 7. Increasing the levels of Vps35 or Vps26 suppresses PR degeneration associated with PLC and AP-m3 mutants.

We argue that this is not the\n\ncase based on the following observations. First, the retromer\n\nmutants exhibit progressive PR degeneration over a 3-wk period\n\n(Figure 1B\u2013C, Figure 2B\u2013C, and Figure S1C\u2013E), whereas\n\napoptosis typically occurs within hours [109]. Second, mutants\n\nthat lead to PR loss via apoptosis lose most PRs within ommatidia\n\nby the engulfment of surrounding glial cells [110]. However, the\n\ndegenerating Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs are not removed,\n\nalthough their morphology is very severely disrupted. Indeed, they\n\ncan still be identified in 3-wk-old flies (Figure 1D, Figure 2D,\n\nFigure 8C, and Figure S1D), indicating a lack of engulfment by\n\nsurrounding cells [111]. Third, overexpressing p35, a pan-caspase\n\ninhibitor of apoptosis [108], fails to suppress the PR degeneration\n\nin Vps26 mutants upon light exposure (unpublished data). Indeed,\n\nRh1 accumulation in different subcellular compartments triggers\n\ndifferent cellular responses, which leads to PR degeneration of\n\nvarying severity [2]. Accumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal\n\npathway seems particularly toxic to PRs but often does not cause\n\nthe removal of PRs for many weeks.\n\nLoss of Wg affects eye development [112], whereas loss of\n\nCrumbs leads to short and/or fused rhabdomeres [113,114].\n\nAlthough the retromer can recycle Wls or Crumbs in some fly\n\ntissues [10\u201314,17,18], Vps261 or Vps35MH20 mutants do not exhibit\n\nobvious eye developmental defects. It is therefore very likely that\n\nthe composition of the eye retromer is different from the wing\n\nretromer. Indeed, loss of Snx3 does not cause obvious degener-\n\native phenotypes when compared to loss of Vps26 or Vps35\n\n(compare Figure S3 with Figures 1 and 2), yet these proteins are all\n\nessential for the recycling of Wls and wing development [10\u201314].\n\nThe Retromer in Photosensitive Cells in Flies and\nVertebrates\n\nMany players required for phototransduction in Drosophila are\n\nconserved in a phototransduction cascade in vertebrate ipRGCs.\n\nThese include melanopsin, PLC, and the TRP channels [60\u201363].\n\nThis phototransduction pathway plays a role in photoentrainment\n\nof circadian rhythms [64\u201367] and the control of the pupillary light\n\nreflex [64,68,69]. We find that vps35 is expressed in 92% of the\n\nmelanopsin-expressing RGCs in the mouse retina (Figure S11B).\n\nThis may be an underestimate due to technical difficulties with b-\nGAL immunostaining in mouse tissues. In addition, the human\n\nVps26 proteins are able to substitute for the function of the fly\n\nhomolog in PRs (Figure 8A\u2013D). Because vertebrate melanopsin\n\nhas very similar photochemical properties to fly rhodopsin\n\n[115,116], the retromer may play a conserved role in vertebrate\n\nipRGCs. As deletion of vps35 leads to early embryonic lethality\n\n[105], a vps35 conditional KO in ipRGCs will need to be\n\nestablished to address its role in ipRGCs.\n\nImplications of the Retromer Complex in Human\nNeurodegenerative Diseases\n\nThe retromer has been implicated in human neurodegenerative\n\ndisease, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and PD [19,20,117].\n\nIn AD, a retromer deficiency has been proposed to affect\n\nsubcellular distribution of b-secretase, which leads to increased\namyloid-beta (Ab) deposits and defective neuronal function\n\n[105,118]. In PD, a missense mutation in VPS35 (D620N) has\n\nbeen shown to cause an autosomal dominant late onset form of the\n\ndisease [19,20]. The Vps35 D620N mutant protein appears to\n\nfunction as a dominant negative, and Vps35 and LRRK2\n\n(Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2) have been shown to interact\n\n[119]. It will therefore be interesting to assess if these mutants\n\naffect ipRGCs as PD patients often have sleep issues [120].\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nFly Strains and Genetics\nVps261 and Vps262 alleles were isolated as described [6,78].\n\nMale large duplications (,1\u20132 Mb) covering the X chromosome\n[121] were crossed with female y,w,mut*,P{neoFRT}19Aisogenized flies\n\nthat were balanced with FM7c,Kr-GAL4,UAS-GFP(Kr.GFP). For\n\nthe XE52 group, the lethality of alleles was rescued by\n\nDp(1;Y)y267g19.2 (1A1;2B17-18 + 20A3;20Fh). XE52 alleles\ncomplemented all the available deficiencies covered by\n\nDp(1;Y)y267g19.2 [122,123]. Therefore, we turned to cross the\n\nXE52 alleles with 80 kb P[acman] duplications that cover the gaps\n\namong deficiencies [124] and found three overlapping duplica-\n\ntions (Dp(1;3)DC446, Dp(1;3)DC033, and Dp(1;3)DC034) that\n\nrescued the lethality of the mutants. These P[acman] duplications\n\nshare a ,21 kb interval. We then performed PCR sequencing for\ngenes localized to this region and identified mutations in Vps26. A\n\nlethal insertion P{EP}Vps26G2008 in Vps26 failed to complement\n\nboth XE52 alleles.\n\nRh117 [84], shits1 [81], y,w,GMR-hid,cl,P{neoFRT}19A [125],\n\nnorpAP24 [65], cm1 [89], w1118 [126], UAS-w RNAi [127], and\n\nGMR-w-RNAi13D [128] were obtained from the Bloomington\n\nDrosophila Stock Center (BDSC).

However, upon chronic light exposure,\npersistent Rh1 accumulation leads to an expansion of late endosomes and lysosomes.

For tissue sections, we\n\nfixed fly tissues with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated the tissues\n\nwith acetone, and embedded them in LR white resin (Electron\n\nMicroscopy Sciences). Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM\n\n710 confocal microscope. Antibodies were used at the following\n\nconcentrations: rabbit anti-Rab5 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-Avl\n\n[84], 1:500; rabbit anti-Rab7 [76], 1:500; mouse anti-PDI\n\n(abcam), 1:100; rabbit anti-GM130 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-\n\nRab11 (abcam, [6]), 1:500; chicken anti-GFP (abcam), 1:1,000;\n\nmouse anti-Rh1 [4C5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank\n\n(DSHB)], 1:50; mouse anti-Wash (P3H3, [131]), 1:20; guinea pig\n\nanti-Vps26, 1:1,000 (this study); biotin-conjugated PNA (Vector\n\nLabs), 1:1,000; Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen),\n\n1:100; and Alexa 405-, Alexa 488-, Cy3-, or Cy5-conjugated\n\nsecondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:600.\n\nWestern Blotting\nFly heads were homogenized in 16 Laemmli sample buffer\n\n(Bio-Rad) containing 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich).\nTissue samples were loaded into 10% gels, separated by SDS-\n\nPAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).\n\nAntibodies were as follows: mouse anti-actin (ICN Biomedicals),\n\n1:2,500; mouse anti-Rh1 (4C5, DSHB), 1:1,000; and rabbit anti-\n\nTRP [58].\n\nMolecular Biology\nCloning.

A C9-\n\nterminal V5 tag was designed in-frame with Vps26. The Vps26\n\nThe Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 15 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847\n\n\n\nPCR product and the pUAST-attB vector were digested with EagI\n\n(NEB) and XbaI (NEB). T4 ligase (NEB) was used to ligate the fly\n\nVps26 PCR products with pUAST-attB vector. Full-length fly\n\nVps35 cDNA was cloned from a plasmid (SD03023 from BDGP)\n\nusing primers 59-CTTCTCGAGGCCACCATGTATCCCTG-\n\nGAGCTCC-39 and 59-TTCTCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTG-\n\nGGACGTCGTATGGGTAATTGAGAGTTATGCCCG-39. A\n\nC-terminal HA tag was added to Vps35. Vps35 PCR product\n\nwas digested with XhoI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with\n\nthe pUAST-attB vector. Full-length human vps26A and vps26B\n\nwere cloned from plasmids (HsCD00296497 and HsCD00076427,\n\nrespectively) (Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University). The\n\nfollowing primers were used for PCR cloning: for hvps26A, 59-\n\nGTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGTTTTCTTGGAGGCTT-39\n\nand 59-GCATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGT-\n\nATGGGTACATTTCAGGCTGTTCGGCAG-39; for hvps26B,\n\n59-GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGCTTCTTCGGCTTCGG-\n\n39 and 59-GAATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCG-\n\nTATGGGTACTGCCTGCAGTTGTTGTCAG-39. A C-termi-\n\nnal HA tag was added to human vps26 isoforms. PCR products\n\nwere digested with EcoRI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with\n\npUAST-attB vectors. Fly Vps26::V5 and Vps35::HA and human\n\nvps26A::HA and vps26B::HA cDNA constructs were purified and\n\ninjected into y,w,WC31 ; VK33 (fly cDNAs) or y,w,WC31 ; VK37\nembryos (human cDNAs), and the transgenic flies were selected.\n\nGenomic tagging. Recombineering was performed to tag\n\nEGFP at the C-terminus of the Vps26 gene. We used primers 59-\n\nGCAATTACGCCCAATACGAAAAAGACCGGTGCAACGC-\n\nCGTTGGCCACCGATGCAGCCCAATTCCGATCATATT-\n\nC-39 and 59-GTTACTACTTATCCCCCTGAAGATGGAAA-\n\nTCCTCTCCAGCTTCCCACTCATTACTTGTACAGCTCG-\n\nTCCATG-39 to amplify a PCR product containing the EGFP tag\n\nfrom the PL452-EGFP template vector [132]. We then electro-\n\nporated the EGFP-tagged PCR products into DY380 bacteria,\n\nwhich had been previously transformed with a 20 kb P[acman]\n\ngenomic rescue construct that covers the entire Vps26 genomic\n\nlocus (clone CH322-92A18 from the BACPAC Resources Center,\n\n[133]). Recombineering and related procedures were performed\n\naccording to the standard protocol [132]. Vps26-gEGFP\u2013tagged\n\ngenomic construct was injected into y,w,WC31 ; VK31 embryos,\nand the transgenic flies were selected.\n\nGeneration of Anti-Fly Vps26 Antibody\nFull-length fly Vps26 cDNA was cloned from LD29140 by PCR\n\nwith primers 59-CTTGGATCCATGAATTTCCTGGGATTC-\n\nGGCCA-39 and 59-CTGGCGGCCGCTCAATCGGTGGC-\n\nCAACGGC-39. PCR products were then digested with BamHI\n\n(NEB) and NotI (NEB) and ligated with a pET28a(+) vector\ncontaining a Hisx6 tag at the N9-terminus (Novagen). The Vps26-\n\npET28a(+) construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS\nbacteria (Invitrogen). Expression of Hisx6-Vps26 was induced\n\nwith 0.5 mM isopropylthio-b-galactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich),\nand the recombinant protein was purified with a Ni-NTA column\n\n(Qiagen) and inoculated into guinea pigs to generate polyclonal\n\nantibodies (Cocalico Biological Inc.).\n\nLight/Dark Cycle and Blue-Orange Light Exposure\nIn general, mosaic flies were grown in the dark at 25uC, and the\n\nnewly eclosed flies were selected and shifted to a 12-h light/dark\n\ncycle (LD, 1,800 lux in the light cycle) or constant darkness (DD) at\n\n25uC for the indicated periods. In the shits suppressor assay,\nanimals were raised in the dark at 18uC to avoid reduced dynamin\nprotein function. Newly eclosed flies were then shifted to 24uC in\nthe dark for 12 h. Flies were then kept in LD or DD at 24uC. For\n\naging experiments, flies were flipped to new vials every 3 d to\n\nmaintain food conditions, and the positions of the vials were\n\nrandomly shuffled to normalize light exposure. For pulse-chase\n\nassays, flies were kept in a box with a blue LED [6] for 20 min and\n\nthen an orange LED for 5 min.\n\nLow Vitamin A\u2013Containing Food\nLow vitamin A\u2013containing food was made according to [134].\n\nIn brief, a solution containing 10% dry yeast, 10% sucrose, 0.02%\n\ncholesterol, and 2% agar was microwaved and poured into fly\n\nvials. After drying at room temperature overnight, fresh low\n\nvitamin A food was used for experiments.\n\nTEM and Bright Field Imaging\nTo prepare fly retina samples for TEM and bright field imaging,\n\nfly heads were dissected and fixed at 4uC in 4% paraformalde-\nhyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, and 0.005%\n\nCaCl2 (PH 7.2) overnight; postfixed in 1% OsO4; dehydrated in\n\nethanol and propylene oxide; and then embedded in Embed-812\n\nresin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with vacuum attachments.\n\nPRs were then sectioned and stained in 4% uranyl acetate and\n\n2.5% lead nitrate. TEM images of PR sections were taken using a\n\nJEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope with an AMT\n\nXR-16 mid-mount 16 mega-pixel digital camera, while bright field\n\npictures were captured using the Zeiss Imager.Z2 light microscope\n\nwith an AxioCamMRm digital camera. The morphology and\n\nquantity of rhabdomeres, endosomes, and lysosomes were\n\ndetermined in Image J.\n\nERGs\nERG recordings were performed as described [6]. Briefly, adult\n\nflies were glued to a glass slide, a recording probe was placed on\n\nthe surface of the eye, and a reference probe was inserted in the\n\nthorax. A 1-s flash of white light was given, and the response was\n\nrecorded and analyzed using the AXONTM-pCLAMPH8 software.\n\nMouse Retina cDNA Preparation and Northern Blot\nAnalysis\n\nMouse retina cDNA was prepared as described [135]. vps26A\n\nwas PCR-amplified using primers 59-GAGTTTTCTTGGAGG-\n\nCTTTTTTGGTCC-39 and 59-TTACATCTCAGGCTGCTC-\n\nCGCAGAGG-39 and a 30 ng cDNA template. The PCR product\n\nwas cloned into pBluescript by blunt-end ligation and verified by\n\nsequencing. DNA probes were generated from gel-purified insert\n\n(excised with EcoRI and HindIII) by random-prime labeling with\n\n[a-32P]dCTP using the DECAprimeII kit (Ambion). Unincorpo-\nrated nucleotides were removed with a MicroBio-Spin 30 column\n\n(Bio-Rad).\n\nFor Northern blot analysis, total RNA was prepared from\n\nretinas of 3\u20134-mo-old CD-1 mice by homogenization in TRI\n\nreagent (Ambion) using a motorized pestle and passage\n\nthrough a 20-gauge needle, extraction with 1-bromo-3-\n\nchloro-propane, and purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).\n\nWe resolved 10 mg of total RNA on a formaldehyde-agarose\ngel and transferred it to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (GE\nHealthcare) by capillary transfer. Membranes were prehybrid-\n\nized in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) for 1 h, then incubated at 42uC\novernight with a ,2.56107 cpm denatured probe diluted in\nULTRAhyb. Blots were washed several times in 26SSC+0.1%\nSDS and several times in 0.16 SSC+0.1% SDS. Washes were\nperformed at 42\u201345uC. For imaging, blots were exposed to a\nstorage phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon (GE\n\nHealthcare).\n\nThe Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 16 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847\n\n\n\nb-Gal and Melanopsin Detection in Mouse Retina\nFor immunohistochemistry, wild-type or vps35 lacZ KI [105]\n\nmouse eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for\n\n45 min, washed in PBS, then stored overnight in 30% sucrose in\n\nPBS.

Upon a 6-h recovery\n\nin the dark, more Rh1 punctae were observed in the cell body of\n\nVps261 PRs when compared to controls (bottom panels). Scale bar,\n\n4 mm. (B) Quantification of the numbers of Rh1 punctae per\nommatidium shown in (A). Sixty ommatidia from three animals\n\nwere examined for each genotype/light condition. Error bars\n\nrepresent SEM; * p,0.05; ns, no significance.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S10 Rh1 levels are decreased upon loss of one copy of\n\nthe Rh1 gene. Western blots for Rh1 and TRP on control (iso),\n\nRh117 heterozygous mutants, Vps261, or Vps261;Rh117/+. Flies\nwere raised in the dark to avoid lysosomal degradation of Rh1\n\ninduced by light. Loss of a copy of the Rh1 gene reduces Rh1\n\nprotein levels. We loaded 0.4 fly heads in each lane.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S11 vps35 is expressed in vertebrate ipRGCs. (A) vps26A\n\nis expressed in the liver and retina of control mice. The left panel\n\nshows the ethidium bromide (EtBr)-stained total RNA in a\n\ndenaturing gel. The right panel shows the results of Northern blot\n\nanalysis of the same gel hybridized to radiolabeled probes for\n\nvps26A. Liver is the positive control for vps26A expression as\n\ndescribed [136]. (B) Immunostaining of melanopsin and b-GAL.\nb-GAL is expressed in the Ganglion Cell Layer from the sectioned\nretina of control (top panels) or vps35 lacZ KI mice (bottom panels)\n\nat P30. b-GAL signals can be detected in ipRGCs of vps35 lacZ KI\nmice (arrow heads) but not in those of the control.

Raman\nAim: Increased production of cytokines and chemokines in serum and tissues upon oxidative stress\ncaused by severe systemic infections are the major cause of sepsis. Aldose reductase (AR) known to medi-\nate oxidative stress-induced NF-jB activation and transcription of cytokines and chemokines are the\nmain mediator of bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammatory response. Our aim is to investigate the effect\nof AR inhibitors on the prevention of inflammatory cytokines in the cecum ligation and puncture (CLP)\nmodel of polymicrobial sepsis which closely mimics the sepsis syndrome in humans. Results: Mice were\nrendered septic by CLP in the absence and presence of AR inhibitor, sorbinil. The levels of cytokines, che-\nmokines and other inflammatory markers in the plasma, peritoneal fluid and heart of mice were signif-\nicantly inhibited by sorbinil. Inhibition of AR also prevented CLP-induced COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1 in\nheart, kidney and spleen. Conclusions: Our results showed that the inhibition of AR significantly prevented\nthe polymicrobial sepsis-induced increase in inflammatory markers and thus indicate the use of AR inhib-\nitors as anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\ufffd 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This disease is characterized by whole-body\ninflammation due to severe systemic infection [2]. Severely burnt\npatients usually develop sepsis which is the major cause of death\nif not aggressively and timely treated [3]. In the United States\nalone, sepsis is the second leading cause of death in non-coronary\nintensive care unit patients [4], which account for 20\u201350% deaths\nper year out of 660,000 affected cases [5]. Despite significant ad-\nvances in the understanding of pathogenesis of sepsis and its com-\nplications, barely a small number of restorative strategies have\nbeen employed that could decrease mortality associated with sep-\ntic shock. Although sepsis is generally initiated by a bacterial infec-\ntion, the pathogenesis of sepsis is characterized by increased levels\nof inflammatory markers such as cytokines and chemokines that\ncould lead to severe complications such as multiorgan failure and\ndeath [6]. Eventhough the treatment with broad range antibiotics\nis generally effective in killing the replicating bacteria, the dead\nbacterial cell wall components act as bacterial toxins which cause\noverwhelming systemic inflammatory response [7]. Thus control-\nll rights reserved.\n\nBiochemistry and Molecular\nBSB, Galveston, TX 77555,\n\na).\nling bacterial infection is not sufficient to treat sepsis. It is rather\nimportant to neutralize the immunogenic signals that activate\ntranscription factors that transcribe inflammatory markers.\nAlthough several new therapeutic strategies have been described\nin the literature for the treatment of sepsis to date, various anti-\ninflammatory strategies have produced only modest therapeutic\neffects in critically ill sepsis patients [8].\n\nRecently, we have shown that the treatment with aldose\nreductase (AR) inhibitors results in profoundly improved survival\nin the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced endotoximia in mice [9].\nThe observed improvement in survival after treatment with AR\ninhibitors or AR-siRNA was associated with restoration of cardiac\nmuscle contractility and cardiac functions. We have demonstrated\nthat a significant increase in the levels of serum as well as heart\ncytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory markers such as\nCOX-2, iNOS and PGE2 in LPS-treated mice which significantly\ncontributes to pathophysiology of sepsis, was markedly prevented\nby AR inhibition [9]. Also inhibition of AR prevented the endo-\ntoxin, high glucose and TNF-a induced increase in the redox-sen-\nsitive transcription factors, NF-jB and AP-1, which are known to\ntranscribe various inflammatory markers [9\u201315]. These results\nsuggest that AR inhibitors, developed as anti-diabetic drugs, could\nbe used as therapeutic intervention to prevent sepsis [16]. AR\ninhibitors such as zopolrestat, fidarestat have been found to be\nsafe and passed in FDA\u2019s phase-II and clinical trials for diabetic\nneuropathy but failed in phase-III clinical trials as they have been\nshown to be not as effective. There are several AR inhibitors such\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2009.07.004\nmailto:kvramana@utmb.edu\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\nA.B.M. Reddy et al. / Cytokine 48 (2009) 170\u2013176 171\nas ranirestat that are still undergoing phase-III trails for diabetic\nneuropathy. An AR inhibitor, epalrestat is available in Japan\nmainly to treat patients with diabetic neuropathy [16,17]. Our re-\ncent results demonstrate that AR inhibitors could be used thera-\npeutically for inflammatory disorders other than diabetic\ncomplications [15,18]. For such use a careful examination of the\neffect of AR inhibition in clinically relevant animal models is\nmandatory. In the present study, we investigated whether treat-\nment with AR inhibitors could prevent alterations in the cytokine\nand chemokine levels in a clinically more relevant model that\nmimics sepsis conditions in humans. Our results indicate that\nAR inhibitor is a powerful repressor of the expression of major\ncytokines and chemokines in a mouse model of polymicrobial\nsepsis indicating its use as potential anti-inflammatory agent in\nsepsis and associated complications.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nAntibodies against COX-2, iNOS p65-NF-jB and HMGB-1 were\npurchased from Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibod-\nies against AR were custom raised and tested for specificity. Mouse\nspecific ELISA kits for cytokines were purchased from BD biosci-\nences (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cytokine antibody array was purchased\nfrom RayBiotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA). Sorbinil was gift from Pfizer\n(Groton, CT). ACTICHROME\ufffd Tissue factor activity assay kit was\npurchased from American diagnostic Inc (Stamford, CT), Tramadol\nHydrochloride from Mallinckrodt Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All other re-\nagents were of the highest purity available.\n2.2. Cecim ligation and puncture procedure\n\nBALB/c female mice (19\u201323 g) were obtained from Jackson lab-\noratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed with regular diet and ambi-\nence for 48 h before recruiting to the study. The animals were\nmaintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health\nand in accordance with the Institute\u2019s \u2018\u2018Guideline of the Animal\nCare and Use Committee\u201d. Using previously described method\n[19] CLP procedure was performed by anesthetizing the mice with\nketamine (60 lg/g) and xylazine (10 lg/g) and a 2-cm midline inci-\nsion was made through the linea alba. The cecum was located, li-\ngated with sterile 3\u20130, silk, and perforated with double puncture\nusing a 18-gauge needle. A small amount of stool was extruded\nto ensure wound potency. Sham-treated mice also had surgery\ndone along with cecal manipulations but without ligation and\npuncture. The cecum was then replaced in its original position\nwithin the abdomen, and incision was immediately closed. Soon\nafter surgery, each mouse received a subcutaneous injection of\n1 ml of warm (37 \ufffdC) normal saline with traMADOL hydrochloride\n(20 lg/g body wt). To inhibit AR, mice received 25 mg/kg body wt\nsorbinil 2 h after surgery and then 6 h after surgery. All mice (5 in\neach group) were kept at 22 \ufffdC and killed after 14 h of surgery.\nBlood was collected from the heart in EDTA-coated tubes. Plasma\nwas separated from cellular components by centrifugation at\n600g for 5 min and stored at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. For peritoneal lavage, 2 cm\nskin was removed leaving the peritoneal membrane intact. Then\n1 ml of ice-cold 1\ufffd Hanks balanced salt solution (without CaCl2,\nMgCl2, Mg2SO4, and phenol red; GIBCO) was injected using 26\ngauge needle. After injection, peritoneum was gently palpated for\n30 s, and peritoneal fluid was aspirated out using a 20 gauge nee-\ndle. The fluid was centrifuged (600g, 5 min), and the supernatant\nwas stored at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. Heart and aorta tissues were collected and\nstored at \ufffd70 \ufffdC for tissue homogenates.\n\n2.3. Measurement of cytokines in plasma\n\nMice after 14 h of surgery were euthanized and blood was col-\nlected into EDTA-coated vacutainers by heart puncture. plasma\nwas separated by centrifugation at 600g for 5 min. Levels of IL-\n1b, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1 in the plasma were measured by using\nrespective mouse specific ELISA kits according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions. Known concentrations of standards were used\nto generate the standard curves. The reaction was initiated by the\naddition of 0.1 ml of the serum, stopped and read at 450 nm on an\nELISA plate reader. The results obtained are expressed as pg/ml of\nthe plasma.\n\n2.4. Measurement of cytokines and chemokines in heart\n\nTo measure the expression of cytokines and chemokines in\nheart tissue homogenates, we used commercially available RayBio\nMouse cytokine antibody array system that determines the expres-\nsion of 64 inflammatory markers from a single sample by following\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. In-brief, 100 lg heart tissue homoge-\nnates were incubated with array support membrane where the\nmembrane was specifically coated with antigens to capture an ar-\nray of cytokines. The tagged proteins were detected by conjugating\nwith biotinylated antibodies and streptavidin system. Fold change\nwas calculated from the measured intensities of the individual\nspots signal developed on X-ray film using Kodak-densitometry\nsoftware.\n\n2.5. Western blot analysis\n\nTo examine the effect of AR inhibition on CLP-induced expres-\nsion of COX-2, iNOS, AR, NF-jB and HMGB-1 we homogenized\nheart, spleen and kidney tissues obtained from euthanized mice\nafter 14 h of CLP procedure. Equal amount of protein from homog-\nenates were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting and\nmembranes were probed for against specific antibodies AR, iNOS,\npP65-NF-jB, COX-2, HMG-1 (HMGB-1) and GAPDH. The antigen\u2013\nantibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemilumines-\ncence (Pierce, Rockford, IL). All blots were probed with GAPDH as\na loading control and densitometric analysis was carried out by\nusing Kodak Image station.\n\n2.6. Tissue factor assay\n\nTissue factor was measured in mice plasma by using ACTI-\nCHROME\ufffd Tissue factor activity assay kit from American diagnostic\nInc. by following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In-brief After the exper-\nimental procedure mice plasma were collected as described in\nmethods and the reaction was initiated by adding equal amount\nof plasma to reaction mixture containing lapidated tissue factor,\nfactor VIII and factor X, allowing to form complex with fVIIa to gen-\nerate TF/fVIIa complexes and convert fX into fXa. fXa cleaves the\nchromogenic substrate and the formation of color is measured by\nreading absorbance at 409 nm using micro well plate reader.\nAmount of tissue factor in the sample were calculated using the\nstandards. The results obtained were measured in pMoles.\n\n2.7. Statistical analysis\n\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and the p values were deter-\nmined using the one-way ANOVA and unpaired Student\u2019s t-test.\n\n\n\n172 A.B.M. Reddy et al. / Cytokine 48 (2009) 170\u2013176\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in plasma and peritoneal\ncytokines by AR inhibition\n\nTo investigate the effect of AR inhibition on polymicrobial infec-\ntion-induced inflammatory response, we performed CLP-surgery on\nmice injected without or with AR inhibitor, sorbinil. Increased red-\nness around the cecum caused by increased blood flow due to dila-\ntory expansion of microcirculatory blood vessels observed in the\nCLP operated mice was prevented by AR inhibitor (Fig. 1). The plasma\nand peritoneal fluids were collected 14 h after CLP procedure and\nanalyzed for cytokines and chemokines. The plasma and peritoneal\nfluid levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1 proteins in sham-oper-\nated controls were low but detectable (Fig. 2A\u2013D, left panel). How-\never in the CLP mice the plasma levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and\nMCP-1 increased by approximately \ufffd0.8-, 37-, 11- and 10-folds,\nrespectively (Fig. 2A\u2013D, left panel). On the other hand, administra-\ntion of sorbinil to the CLP mice significantly (\ufffd45\u201380%) prevented\nthe increase in the plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines. Sim-\nilarly, in CLP mice the peritoneal fluid levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and\nMCP-1 increased by 5.2-, 31-, 10- and 5-folds, respectively (Fig. 2A\u2013\nD, right panel) and administration of sorbinil to the CLP mice signif-\nicantly (\ufffd40\u201370%) prevented the increase in cytokine levels. AR\ninhibitors alone had no effect on the basal levels of these cytokines\nand chemokines in plasma or peritoneal fluid. Further, the measure-\nment of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6) in the ser-\num at 3 h after CLP-surgery did not cause any increase in the\ncytokine levels as compared to controls and AR inhibitor treated\nmice (data not shown). These results suggest that AR inhibition\ncould prevent polymicrobial infection-induced systemic production\nof inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mice.\n\n3.2. Prevention of CLP-induced increase in tissue cytokines by AR\ninhibition\n\nSince increased cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyopathy due\nto augmented local production of inflammatory cytokines and\nFig. 1. AR inhibition prevents CLP-induced redness around the wound: after 14 h of CLP\npictures were taken immediately after the opening of wound. The region showing redn\nchemokines are the major cause of mortality and morbidity ob-\nserved in patients with sepsis [20], we specifically examined\nthe effect of AR inhibition on CLP-induced cytokines and che-\nmokines in the mice hearts. We used an antibody array that\ndetermines the expression of 64 cytokines and chemokines\nand other inflammatory markers from a single sample\n(Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of MIP-2, MIP-1 and\nlymphotoxin increased by \ufffd6-fold in CLP mice group whereas\nthe increase was only \ufffd3-fold in case of CLP + sorbinil group.\nSimilarly the levels of other cytokines and chemokines were\nsignificantly elevated in CLP group of mice and administration\nof AR inhibitor significantly prevented these cytokines and che-\nmokines (Fig. 3B).\n\nWe next determined the effect of AR inhibition on the CLP-in-\nduced levels of inflammatory markers COX-2, iNOS and HMGB-1\nin heart, spleen and kidney homogenates by Western blot anal-\nysis (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4A and B, polymicrobial sepsis\ncaused \ufffd3.5-, \ufffd2.5-fold induction of COX-2 and iNOS respec-\ntively which was significantly (\ufffd90%) prevented by the adminis-\ntration of AR inhibitor. Similarly in CLP mice tissue homogenates,\na significant increase in AR protein was observed and inhibitors\nof AR prevented CLP-induced increase in the expression of AR\nprotein (Fig. 4C). Since the expression of cytokines and chemo-\nkines, COX-2, iNOS and AR depends on the activation of NF-jB,\nwe next measured the activated form of NF-jB in mice heart,\nspleen and kidney homogenates. As shown in Fig. 4D the CLP-in-\nduced activation of NF-jB in mice tissue homogenates was sig-\nnificantly prevented by AR inhibition. Since activated\nmacrophages and monocytes secrete HMGB-1 protein which acts\nas a mediator of inflammation [21], we next measured the effect\nof AR inhibition on the expression of HMGB-1. As shown in\nFig. 4E, increased expression of HMGB-1 protein was observed\nin CLP tissues as compared to sham controls and ARI treatment\nsignificantly prevented CLP-induced HMGB-1. These results sug-\ngested that AR inhibition could prevent CLP-induced inflamma-\ntion by inhibiting redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-jB \u2013\ndependent expression of various inflammatory markers such as\ncytokines and chemokines.\n, mice were killed and wound was accessed for severity of the inflammation.

Data are expressed as Mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 4). *P < 0.001 vs.\ncontrol, #P < 0.001 vs. CLP, **P < 0.05 vs. control, ##P < 0.05 vs. CLP. ARI = AR inhibitor.\n\nA.B.M.

Prevention of CLP-induced activation of plasmatissue factor by AR\ninhibition\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the use of anti-coagulants\nwould be beneficial in preserving platelets and organ functions in\nendotoxemia-model via mechanisms involving inactivation of tis-\nsue factor, which plays a critical role in the initiation of complex\nmechanisms in the process of blood clot which causes organ dys-\nfunction [22]. We therefore, measured the activation of tissue fac-\ntor in CLP mice plasma. Our results (Fig. 5) show that tissue factor\nactivity was much higher in CLP group as compared to CLP + ARI\ngroup of mice as well as sham-operated control mice indicating\nthat inhibition of AR could prevent secretion of tissue factor.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nPolymicrobial sepsis is a serious medical condition character-\nized by shock, hypoxemia, and organ dysfunction and dissemi-\nnated intravascular coagulation [1,23]. Although subjects of all\nage groups upon severe bacterial infections can get sepsis, higher\nmortality has been observed in overweight, older age, intubated\nand immunocompromised patients [5]. Severe sepsis results from\nthe body\u2019s systemic over-response to infection that disrupts\nhomeostasis through an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation\n[24], blood coagulation and impaired fibriolysis [21]. Even though\ncontrolling bacterial infections by aggressive antibiotics therapy\nand maintaining homeostasis in immune response saves a num-\nber of lives, 20\u201325% patients die because of multiorgan failure\n[4,5,25]. Although precise mechanism(s) of multiorgan failure is\nnot clearly understood, several clinical models have been devel-\noped to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in sepsis patho-\ngenesis [26]. Among them, CLP-model has been shown to\nclosely replicate the nature and course of clinical sepsis. This\nmodel is highly reproducible and widely used to study the mech-\naninsm(s) of multiorgan failure as well as for testing the efficacy\nof drugs [27].\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Inhibition of AR prevents inflammatory cytokines in mice hearts: after 14 h of CLP, mice hearts were dissected out and homogenates were made. The levels of various\n(as indicated in table under the figure) inflammatory markers were measured by using Ray Bio Mouse cytokine antibody array. The intensity of the spots was measured by\ndensitometry and compared with positive and negative controls. (A) Representative picture is shown.

Panel 1: heart, panel 2: spleen and panel 3: kidney. The antibody binding was detected by enhanced pico chemiluminescence\n(Pierce). The fold change was determined by densitometry scanning, as indicated at the top of the Western blot. ARI = AR inhibitor.\n\nFig. 5.

The tissue factor activity was measured by using ACTI-\nCHROME\ufffd Tissue factor activity assay kit from American diagnostic Inc. as\ndescribed in Section 2. Data are expressed as Mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 4). *P < 0.001 vs.\ncontrol and #P < 0.001 vs. CLP. ARI = AR inhibitor.\n\nA.B.M. Reddy et al. / Cytokine 48 (2009) 170\u2013176 175\nUncontrolled generation of proinflammatory cytokines and che-\nmokines has been noted in experimental models of sepsis as well\nas in clinical settings. Early release of macrophage-derived proin-\nflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and MCP-1 have\nbeen shown to be important in the pathogenesis of septic shock\nand multiorgan failure [28\u201331]. In our study, AR inhibitor adminis-\ntration resulted in a significant decrease in these proinflammatory\ncytokines not only in the plasma and peritoneal fluids but in the\nheart as well. Thus the ability of AR inhibited mice to produce less\ninflammatory cytokines in response to CLP-induced sepsis could\nindicate the potential use of AR inhibitors in prevention of sepsis\nand its associated complications. It is well known that under oxida-\ntive stress-induced by infections, bacterial toxins and during vari-\nous pathological conditions NF-jB is significantly activated which\nregulates the expression of genes involved in inflammatory re-\nsponses [10,18]. The mechanisms by which AR inhibition exerts\nan inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine levels may in-\nvolve the suppression of NF-jB activity [11,29]. In fact, several re-\nports suggest that inhibition of NF-jB could prevent inflammatory\nresponse observed in sepsis. For example, anti-oxidants such as N-\nacetylcystene, ascorbic acid, and a-tocopherol [32\u201335] which pre-\nvent the activation of ROS-induced NF-jB have been shown to pro-\ntect animals and humans from septic shock. We have recently\nshown that AR inhibitors which act like anti-oxidants and prevent\nbacterial endotoxin, LPS- induced generation of ROS prevent the\nactivation of NF-jB and the expression of inflammatory markers\nin macrophages as well as in mice serum [9,12\u201314]. We have\nshown that AR-catalyzed reduced products of lipid aldehyde gluta-\nthione conjugates such as GS-DHN could mediate the signaling\npathway that eventually increases transcription of inflammatory\nmarkers in vascular smooth muscle cells and other cells [14]. The\nincreased cytokines, chemokines and growth factors subsequently\ninitiate the signal transduction pathways that result in increased\nsecretion of inflammatory markers which cause inflammation\nand multiorgan failure. Our cellular studies using vascular smooth\nmuscle cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages have\ndemonstrated that ROS-induced NF-jB activation and transcrip-\ntion of inflammatory markers such as TNF-a, IL-1b, COX-2 and\niNOS can be prevented by inhibiting AR [10\u201315]. In the present\nstudy also our results indicate that the release of bacteria into\nthe peritoneum by CLP procedure causes a significant increase in\nvarious inflammatory markers in the peritoneal fluid which is sig-\nnificantly prevented by AR inhibitor. Since several of the AR inhib-\nitors have been found to be safe and have already been studied for\nphase-1 and phase-2 clinical trails for diabetic neuropathy [16,17],\nthe use of AR inhibitors as anti-inflammatory drug would be less\ntime consuming and if found as effective in humans as in experi-\nmental model of sepsis, they could be used therapeutically in the\ninflammatory disorder patients. In summary, our results suggest\nthat the AR inhibition has anti-inflammatory effects in murine\nmodel of sepsis. Further studies are required to use AR inhibition\nas an excellent therapeutic approach to treat sepsis especially\nthose patients in which antibiotics though kill the bacteria, the cir-\n\n\n\n176 A.B.M.

The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electro-\nphoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-\nresistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline,\nwhereas resistance to the \ufffd-lactam\u2013\ufffd-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved\nwas CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as\nwell as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be\ntransferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem\nresistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 \ufffdg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem,\nrespectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis\nof the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the\nformer expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of\nthem. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the\ninterruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large\noutbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the\nliterature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple\nspecies. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development\nin CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nSince plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum \ufffd-lactamases\n(ESBLs) were first detected in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate\nin 1983 in Germany (22), they have been increasingly reported\nworldwide (5). The classical ESBLs are those derived from the\nbroad-spectrum enzymes TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 by the\nacquisition of specific point mutations which expand their\nspectrum of hydrolysis to oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreo-\nnam (7). Nevertheless, the most widespread plasmid-mediated\nESBLs nowadays are the CTX-M enzymes, which are directly\nderived from the chromosomal \ufffd-lactamases of several species\nof the genus Kluyvera (3). Five different groups of CTX-Ms\ncontaining a total of over 30 different variants have been de-\nscribed so far, with CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-\nM-9, and CTX-M-25 being the first reported representatives.\nCTX-M-1 (also known as MEN-1) was the first reported variant,\ndetected from an Escherichia coli strain in 1989 in Germany (2),\nbut CTX-M-2, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M-15 are the\nmost widespread enzymes (3).\n\nThe production of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae confers re-\nsistance to all penicillins and cephalosporins (with the excep-\ntion of cephamycins), with the organism generally remaining\nsusceptible only to \ufffd-lactam\u2013\ufffd-lactamase inhibitor combina-\ntions, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the carbapenems,\nwhich are frequently the only therapeutic options available for\ntreatment of hospital-acquired severe infections caused by\nthese microorganisms (25). Coresistance to non-\ufffd-lactam an-\ntibiotics is also frequent, either by the cotransfer of the resis-\ntance determinants in the same genetic elements (such as ami-\nnoglycoside resistance) or simply by the coselection of both\nresistance mechanisms, as occurs with fluoroquinolones (32).\n\nIn this work we characterized a large outbreak caused by a\nCTX-M-1-producing multiresistant K. pneumoniae strain in a\nSpanish intensive care unit (ICU). Although CTX-M-1 was the\nfirst CTX-M described, over 15 years ago, and has been de-\ntected in various countries, including at least Germany and\nFrance (14), Italy (31), and recently, in a single E. coli isolate\nfrom cattle milk, Spain (6), and in several species, including E.\ncoli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter\namalonaticus (28), reports of CTX-M-1-producing K. pneu-\nmoniae strains have not yet been published, and this is the first\nreport of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobac-\n\n* Corresponding author.

Furthermore, in this work we document\nand characterize for the first time in vivo resistance develop-\nment to carbapenems in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteria-\nceae due to the selection of mutations leading to the lack of\nexpression of porins.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nClinical strains and antibiotic susceptibility testing. All ESBL-producing\nEnterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to the adult ICU (30 beds\ndivided in three contiguous units) from Hospital Son Dureta (900 beds;\nreference public hospital from the Island of Mallorca, Spain) have been\nprospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak caused\nby multiresistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was detected. Bacterial\nidentification and initial susceptibility testing were performed with the\nWIDER semiautomatic system (Francisco Soria Melguizo, Madrid, Spain)\n(8). Double-disk synergy testing (DDST) for the detection of ESBL produc-\ntion was performed using amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,\ncefepime, and aztreonam disks that were applied 30 and/or 20 mm apart (20).\nAdditionally, the MICs of several antibiotics were determined for selected\nisolates by using Etest strips (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), following the\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. For the screening of intestinal coloniza-\ntion by the epidemic K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing strain, from May to\nDecember 2005, rectal swabs, collected weekly, were plated on MacConkey\nagar supplemented with 2 \ufffdg/ml of cefotaxime and 10 \ufffdg/ml of gentamicin.\nThe screening for intestinal colonization was carried out for all patients with\npositive clinical samples as well as those patients present in the same unit at\nthe time of isolation. For those patients, weekly rectal swabs were obtained\nuntil discharge or until three consecutive negative colonization results.\n\nMolecular strain typing. The clonal relationship between the different isolates\nwas studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Agarose plugs contain-\ning total bacterial DNA were prepared as described elsewhere (21). Plugs were\nthen digested with XbaI and loaded into a 1% Megabase agarose (Bio-Rad, La\nJolla, Calif.) gel. DNA separation was performed in a CHEF-DRIII apparatus\n(Bio-Rad, La Jolla, Calif.) under the following conditions: 6 V/cm2 for 20 h at\n14\u00b0C, with initial and final pulse times of 2 s and 35 s, respectively. The results\nwere interpreted following the criteria of Tenover et al. (37).\n\nCharacterization of \ufffd-lactamases and their genes. The pIs of the \ufffd-lactamases\nwere determined by isoelectric focusing (IEF), applying the supernatants of\ncrude sonic cell extracts to Phast gels (Pharmacia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with a\npH gradient of 3 to 9 in a Phast system (Pharmacia). \ufffd-Lactamases with known\npI values (TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-4, TEM-3, SHV-1, CTX-M-10, and CTX-M-1)\nwere included as controls. Gels were stained with 500 \ufffdg/ml of nitrocefin (Oxoid)\nto identify the bands corresponding to \ufffd-lactamases. PCRs for genes encoding\nTEM, SHV, CTX-M-9, and CTX-M-10 \ufffd-lactamases were performed using\nprimers and conditions described previously (10). Primers CTX-MF (5\ufffd-GACT\nATTCATGTTGTTGTTATTTC-3\ufffd) and CTX-MR (5\ufffd-TTACAAACCGTTGG\nTGACG-3\ufffd) were used for the amplification of a 923-bp DNA fragment (nucle-\notides \ufffd48 to the stop codon) from the genes encoding CTX-M-1 or closely\nrelated ESBLs. Taq Gold polymerase (PE-Applied Biosystems) was used for\nPCR amplification under the following conditions: 12 min at 94\u00b0C, 35 cycles of\namplification (1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 58\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C), and a final\nextension step of 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Two independent PCR products were se-\nquenced on both strands, using the BigDye terminator kit (PE-Applied Biosys-\ntems) for performing the sequencing reactions, which were analyzed with the\nABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (PE-Applied Biosystems).\n\nConjugation, transformation, and plasmid analysis. Conjugation experiments\nwere performed by filter mating using a rifampin-resistant mutant of E. coli strain\nHB101 as the recipient in 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, triparenteral crossings using\nthe same recipient and E. coli HB101(pRK2013) as a mobilization helper (12) in\na 1:1:1 ratio were attempted. Transconjugants were selected in Luria-Bertani\n(LB) agar plates containing 100 \ufffdg/ml of rifampin and 2 \ufffdg/ml of cefotaxime. For\ntransformation experiments, plasmid DNAs from the ESBL-producing K. pneu-\nmoniae isolates obtained using the QIAGEN plasmid Midi kit (QIAGEN,\nHilden, Germany) were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain made\ncompetent by CaCl2 treatment. Transformants were selected in LB agar plates\ncontaining 50 \ufffdg/ml of ampicillin. Transconjugants or transformants were\nchecked by DDST followed by IEF, PCR amplification of the appropriate ESBL-\nencoding gene, and Etest testing of susceptibility to all \ufffd-lactams and non-\ufffd-\nlactams (to determine the resistance determinants cotransferred with the ESBL)\ndefined above. For the estimation of the plasmid size, plasmid DNA obtained\nfrom one of the transformants was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and EcoRI plus\n\nBamHI, and the restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 1%\nagarose gel. The sizes of the different fragments were estimated by plotting\nagainst the standard curve obtained with the Superladder-Mid1 100-bp ladder\nmolecular weight markers (Gensura) and the lambda HindIII digest (New\nEngland Biolabs).\n\nIsolation and analysis of OMP. Cell envelopes were isolated from K. pneu-\nmoniae strains grown in LB medium by centrifugation at 100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h at\n4\u00b0C after French press cell lysis. Outer membrane proteins (OMP) were isolated\nas sodium lauryl sarcosynate-insoluble material (15). Electrophoretic analysis of\nOMP by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-\nPAGE) was performed with 11% acrylamide\u20130.35% bisacrylamide\u20130.1% SDS by\nusing Laemmli\u2019s buffers (24) and Coomassie blue staining. Samples were boiled\nfor 5 min in sample buffer before electrophoresis. Western blot analysis of\nSDS-PAGE-separated OMP was carried out with the buffers and conditions\ndescribed by Towbin et al. (38), Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), rabbit\nantiserum raised against purified OmpK36 porin (1), and alkaline phosphatase-\nlabeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma). Enzyme was detected with 5-bromo-\n4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate toluidinium\u2013nitroblue tetrazolium. K. pneumoniae\nLB1, which expresses only one porin, was used as a control (26).\n\nPCR amplification of porin genes. The primers used to amplify the OmpK36\nporin gene were OmpK36-0 (5\ufffd AAGCTTGTTGGATTATTCTGC-3\ufffd) and\nOmpK36-end (5\ufffd-CAAGCTTAGAACTGGTAAACC-3\ufffd). They anneal specifi-\ncally to sequences of ompK36 located 116 bp upstream and 1,084 bp downstream\nof the ompK36 start codon (26), respectively. PCR amplifications were per-\nformed in a Thermoline Amplitron 1 thermal cycler by using Taq polymerase\n(Pharmacia) with 30 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and 1\nmin at 72\u00b0C). Amplicons were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and\nethidium bromide staining and sequenced as described above.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAll ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from pa-\ntients admitted to an adult ICU were prospectively docu-\nmented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak of multi-\nresistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae infection was detected.\nThe incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated\nduring this period is shown in Fig. 1A. As can be observed, a\ndramatic increase in the number of patients infected by ESBL-\nproducing K. pneumoniae was documented during 2005, with a\ntotal of 52 cases, in contrast to the 1 case documented in either\n2003 or 2004 and the 0 cases documented in 2002. Figure 1B\nshows the distribution of new cases on a monthly basis during\n2005, clearly showing that the epidemic started in February\nand reached its peak during May and June, with 13 and 12 new\ncases, respectively. From then on, the incidence of new cases\non a monthly basis fluctuated from zero to six new cases per\nmonth. Since five new cases were detected in December, the\noutbreak still cannot be considered to have been controlled at\nthe end of the year. In May 2005, in addition to measures for\nthe contact isolation of infected patients, a protocol for routine\ndetection and isolation of patients with intestinal colonization\nwas established; rectal swabs were collected weekly and plated\nin selective media, and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was\nidentified as described in Materials and Methods. The out-\nbreak had a dramatic impact on the prevalence of ESBL-\nproducing K. pneumoniae in the ICU, reaching 60.3% of pa-\ntients infected (not including patients with only intestinal\ncolonization) by K. pneumoniae during 2005, in contrast to 0%,\n4.5%, and 3.8% for the years 2002, 2003, and 2004, respec-\ntively.\n\nAll but one of the K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from the\n52 patients had the same pattern of multiresistance as initially\ndocumented with the WIDER microdilution-based semiauto-\nmatic system for bacterial identification and susceptibility test-\ning (8), showing, in addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance\n\n2832 MENA ET AL.

All isolates with this pattern of multi-\nresistance were uniformly susceptible, when first recovered\n(see below), only to amikacin and carbapenems. The single\nisolate with a different resistance pattern was ciprofloxacin\nsusceptible and amikacin resistant.\n\nAll ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (one randomly\nselected isolate from each of the 52 patients) were confirmed\nto belong to a single epidemic, multiresistant clone, with the\nexception of that isolate with a different resistance pattern, by\nPFGE. Furthermore, the single isolate from 2003 was found to\nbe nonrelated to the epidemic clone by PFGE, but the isolate\nfrom 2004 (detected in November, 3 months before the initi-\nation of the outbreak) was found to be highly related to the\nepidemic clone, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nThe sources of the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae epi-\ndemic clone for the 51 ICU patients during the 2005 outbreak\n\nare shown in Table 1. In 44 (86.3%) of the patients the epi-\ndemic clone was isolated from clinical samples, most fre-\nquently from the respiratory tract (30 patients; 68.2%),\nwhereas in 7 (13.7%) of them it was detected only in intestinal\ncolonization studies. Intestinal colonization studies were per-\nformed for 34 of the 44 infected patients (77.3%), with a\npositive result obtained for 32 (94.1%), thus showing that in-\ntestinal colonization occurs in most infected patients.\n\nTo characterize the ESBL produced by the epidemic K.\npneumoniae clone, IEF was performed with three random iso-\nlates, revealing in all cases the presence of a \ufffd-lactamase band\nwith a pI of \ufffd8.4 cofocusing with the CTX-M-1 control. PCR\namplification was found to be positive only when using the\nprimers for the gene encoding CTX-M-1 or related enzymes\nand sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presence\nof blaCTX-M-1. As could be expected, the single ESBL-produc-\ning K. pneumoniae isolate from 2004 (clonally related to the\n2005 outbreak isolates) also produced CTX-M-1. On the other\n\nFIG. 1. A.

Nevertheless, the plasmid\nlocation of blaCTX-M-1was demonstrated by transformation ex-\nperiments. Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli, and\nthree transformants growing on LB agar plates containing 50\n\ufffdg/ml of ampicillin were first checked by DDST followed by\nIEF, which revealed the presence of a single \ufffd-lactamase band\nwith a pI of \ufffd8.4, and then by PCR amplification with the\nspecific primers. The size of the plasmid determined by the\nanalysis of the EcoRI and BamHI restriction fragments was\nestimated to be approximately 50 kb.\n\nIn two of the patients infected by the epidemic multiresistant\nK. pneumoniae clone, development of carbapenem (imipenem,\nmeropenem, and ertapenem) resistance was documented. For\none of them, the carbapenem-resistant isolate was recovered\nfrom respiratory samples after treatment with imipenem, and\nfor the other the isolate was recovered from urine after treat-\nment with meropenem. In both patients, the carbapenem-re-\nsistant isolates were additionally detected in the intestinal col-\nonization studies. PFGE macrorestriction patterns of the two\ncarbapenem-resistant isolates were found to be identical to\n\nthose of the carbapenem-susceptible isolates, and the acquisi-\ntion of additional \ufffd-lactamases was ruled out by IEF.\n\nTable 2 shows the MICs (determined by Etest) of several\n\ufffd-lactam and non-\ufffd-lactam antibiotics for five representative\nisolates of the epidemic clone recovered from different pa-\ntients and during different periods and for the two carbap-\nenem-resistant isolates. The MICs in both resistant isolates\nwere slightly higher for ertapenem (MIC of \ufffd32 \ufffdg/ml), fol-\nlowed by meropenem (MIC of 16 \ufffdg/ml) and imipenem (MIC\nof 8 to 12 \ufffdg/ml). The MICs for the E. coli transformant\nharboring the blaCTX-M-1-carrying plasmid (pAMR-1) are also\nshown in Table 2. As can be observed, in addition to the\nESBL-mediated resistance pattern, aminoglycoside (gentami-\ncin and tobramycin) resistance was cotransferred in the same\nplasmid. As for carbapenems, pAMR-1 significantly raised the\nMICs for E. coli XL1-Blue of ertapenem (from 0.012 to 0.125\n\ufffdg/ml) and, to a lesser extent, of meropenem (from 0.016 to\n0.047 \ufffdg/ml) but not of imipenem (0.38 \ufffdg/ml) (harboring or not\npAMR-1). Nevertheless, the MICs of the three carbapenems\nremained far below the resistance breakpoints.\n\nIn order to investigate whether carbapenem resistance was\ncaused by alterations of the outer membrane permeability, we\nanalyzed the outer membrane proteins of susceptible and re-\nsistant pairs of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates from two pa-\ntients. SDS-PAGE analysis of the OMP of K. pneumoniae\ngrown in LB showed only two major proteins, of about 33 and\n36 kDa, in the 31- to 45-kDa range for the carbapenem-sus-\nceptible isolates, corresponding to OmpA and OmpK36, re-\nspectively. On the other hand, the 36-kDa protein was absent\nin both carbapenem-resistant isolates (Fig. 3A). The porin\nnature of the 36-kDa protein present in the carbapenem-sus-\nceptible isolates and absent in the resistant ones was confirmed\nby Western blot analysis using specific antibodies (Fig. 3B).\nThe specific antiserum reacted with the band present in the\nsusceptible isolates and the control K. pneumoniae LB1 but\nfailed to detect the protein in the resistant isolates.\n\nTo investigate the cause of the porin deficiency observed in\nthe carbapenem-resistant isolates, we amplified the entire\n\nFIG. 2.

Multiple\noutbreaks of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have indeed\nbeen reported over the past two decades, and certainly K.\npneumoniae has been the most frequently involved organism\n(33, 35, 36). Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first report of a large outbreak by CTX-M-1-producing\nEnterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented de-\nscription in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, de-\nspite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple\nspecies, including E. coli, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, and C.\namalonaticus. A hospital outbreak due to a K. pneumoniae\nstrain producing an ESBL related to CTX-M-1 was described\nin Japan (23), but since the gene encoding the ESBL was not\nsequenced and CTX-M-1 has not been reported in the Far\nEast, it is more likely that the enzyme involved was actually one\nof its close relatives, either CTX-M-3 or CTX-M-15, both of\nwhich were already found in Japanese hospitals (3).\n\nCTX-M-2, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M.15 are the\nmost widespread CTX-M enzymes (3). As for Spanish hospi-\ntals, most CTX-M ESBLs found in a nationwide study were\n\nFIG. 3.

At this stage, the only\npublished documentation of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacte-\nriaceae in Spain is the report of a single E. coli isolate detected\nin cattle milk (6).\n\nCarbapenems are frequently the only therapeutic options\navailable for treatment of hospital-acquired severe infections\ncaused by multiresistant ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae\nsuch as the strain described in this work. Nevertheless, univer-\nsal susceptibility to these last-line antimicrobials in Enterobac-\nteriaceae is no longer guaranteed. Indeed, several carbapen-\nemases have been described as occurring in Enterobacteriaceae,\nincluding representatives from classes A, such as the highly\ndisseminated KPC enzymes; B, such as IMP or VIM metallo-\n\ufffd-lactamases; or D, such as OXA-48 (29, 34, 39). Additionally,\ncarbapenem resistance development in strains producing\nESBLs or AmpC \ufffd-lactamases due to the selection of mutants\nwith reduced permeability to these antimicrobials is being in-\ncreasingly reported (4, 9). Previous work has shown that the\nexpression of both major K. pneumoniae porins, OmpK35 and\nOmpK36, plays a role in the susceptibility to carbapenem an-\ntibiotics and that mutants lacking expression of both outer\nmembrane proteins show reduced susceptibility to these anti-\nmicrobials, especially when combined with AmpC enzymes and\nsome class A ESBLs (11, 13, 19, 27). Nevertheless, in this work\nwe document and characterize for the first time the develop-\nment of in vivo resistance to carbapenems in CTX-M-1-pro-\nducing Enterobacteriaceae due to the selection of mutations\nleading to the lack of porin expression. As frequently occurs in\nclinical ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (18), the epi-\ndemic strain described in this work did not express OmpK35,\nfavoring carbapenem resistance development through the in-\nactivation of OmpK36. Inactivation of OmpK36 in one of the\nstrains was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of\nthe coding sequence by an insertion sequence, as has been\npreviously reported for other clinical strains (17). As for the\nsecond carbapenem-resistant isolate, the failure of ompK36\namplification could suggest that the mechanism for inactiva-\ntion was either a deletion of part or the complete coding\nsequence or its interruption by an insertion sequence too large\nto be amplified by conventional PCR.\n\nOverall, CTX-M-1-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from 2\nof the 44 infected patients (4.5%) developed carbapenem re-\nsistance in clinical samples. Nevertheless, both patients had\nintestinal colonization by the carbapenem-resistant isolate\nwhen it was detected in the clinical samples, which could sug-\ngest that resistance development may have taken place in the\nintestines of the colonized patients. Since the development of\ncarbapenem resistance was not systematically explored in the\nintestinal colonization studies, we may indeed be underesti-\nmating the magnitude of the potential problem of carbapenem\nresistance development in colonized patients as a source of\ncarbapenem-resistant isolates.\n\nIn summary, we have described a large outbreak due to a\nmultiresistant CTX-M-1-producing and OmpK35-deficient K.\npneumoniae strain in an ICU and have characterized the mech-\nanisms leading to in vivo carbapenem resistance development\n\nthrough the inactivation of OmpK36 in two of the infected\npatients.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Enrique Ruiz de Gopegui for collecting the\ndata on the prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae infec-\ntions in the ICU.\n\nThis work was partially supported by the \u201cRed Espan\u0303ola de Inves-\ntigacio\u0301n en Patolog\u0131\u0301a Infecciosa\u201d (C03-014) and grant PI040339 from\nthe Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias from the Ministerio de\nSanidad and grant SAF2005-01466 from the Ministerio de Educacio\u0301n\ny Ciencia of Spain.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

Introduction\n\nMuscle stem cells, also known as myoblasts, are normally pres-\nent as quiescent satellite cells between the basement membrane\nand the plasma membrane of myofibrils [1]. In response to injury,\nexercise or in pathogenic states, they become activated, re-enter\ncell cycle and start to proliferate actively. Eventually, these prolif-\nerating satellite cells irreversibly withdraw from cell cycles, differ-\nentiate and fuse with existing myofibrils [2]. These sequential\nevents are called muscle regeneration. In this process, the differen-\ntiation of myoblasts is controlled by two families of transcription\nfactors, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myocyte enhan-\ncer-binding factor 2(MEF2s) [3], which are regulated by a variety\nof growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), leuke-\nmia inhibitory factor (LIF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic\nfibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor\n(PDGF), and transforming growth factor-a [4]. In addition, many\nsignaling pathways, such as Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and JAK/STATs\nare involved in the regulation of myoblasts differentiation. LIF\nll rights reserved.\n\n2 (K.

The intra-\ncellular signaling pathways responsible for LIF action involve the\nactivation of Jak and/or Tyk kinases. Activated Jak/Tyk phosphory-\nlates (signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1,\nSTAT3 or STAT5) can translocates into the nucleus and transacti-\nvate LIF-responsive genes.\n\nSTAT proteins transduce pivotal biological effects of various\ncytokines and hormones [5]. Among seven STAT family members\n(STAT1-4, 5A, 5B, and 6), STAT3 is activated by several cytokines,\nsuch as the IL-6 family (LIF, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin\nM, IL-11, and cardiotrophin-1), IGF-I, HGF, EGF, PDGF, and bFGF.\nThus, STAT3 plays a central role in the regulation of growth, differ-\nentiation, and survival in many types of cells [6]. For example,\nSTAT3 promotes cell growth through the transcriptional regulation\nof cyclin D1 in fibroblasts [7] and through the transcriptional reg-\nulation of c-myc and Pim1 in hematopoietic cell lines [8\u20139]. In\naddition, STAT3 maintains embryonic stem cells in an undifferen-\ntiated state [10] and inhibits IL-6-induced neuronal differentiation\nin PC12 cells [11]. These data indicate that STAT3 promotes cell\ngrowth and suppresses cell differentiation. However, STAT3 has\nbeen reported to mediate cytokine-induced terminal differentia-\ntion in other cell types, such as IL-6-induced macrophage differen-\ntiation [12], CD40 ligand-induced B-cell differentiation [13],\nOSM-induced differentiation of an osteosarcoma cell line [14],\nciliary neurotrophic factor or OSM-induced astrocyte differentia-\ntion [15,16], and LIF-mediated endothelial differentiation in car-\ndiac stem cells [17]. Therefore, the role of STAT3 in cell growth\n\nmailto:sunluguo@yahoo.com.cn\nmailto:mkwyypxy@163.com\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n138 Y. Yang et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 137\u2013141\nand differentiation is divergent according to the cellular back-\nground and/or the type of cytokines.\n\nHowever, the function of STAT3 signal pathway in regulating\nmyogenesis still remains largely unknown. As a transcriptional\nfactor, STAT3 mediates several biological functions including pro-\nliferation, differentiation, and survival of myoblasts via activating\nits target genes (cyclin D1, c-fos, JunB, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL) [18\u201329],\neither by directly binding to regulatory region of target genes or\nby interacting with other transcriptional factors. It has also been\nreported that the intrinsic muscle-specific transcriptional factors,\nsuch as MyoD, MEF2 and SIX1, play crucial roles in skeletal muscle\ndevelopment in coordination with exogenous growth factors dur-\ning myogenesis. Thus, it is necessary to demonstrate whether\nSTAT3 can induce myogenic differentiation by interacting with\nMyoD, MEF2 or SIX1. MyoD is known to regulate myogenic differ-\nentiation through its transcriptional activities and protein\u2013protein\ninteractions, leading to cell cycle arrest and myoblast differentia-\ntion at the early phase. MEF2 is also capable of directly interacting\nwith members of the MRFs (i.e., MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and\nMRF4) to synergistically activate many muscle-specific genes\n[30,31]. The human SIX1, a member of the SIX classes of homeodo-\nmain genes, is such a transcription factor functioning as a master\nregulatory protein and transactivating the MEF3 site containing\nreporter genes, such as myogenin [32].\n\nTo further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the\nrole of STAT3 in myogenic differentiation, we examined whether\nthe STAT3 protein interacts with these key myogenic regulatory\nfactors. We elucidated the role of STAT3 signal pathway during\nmyogenic differentiation using C2C12 cells, an immortalized myo-\ngenic cell line derived from mouse MSCs [37]. Our results con-\nfirmed that STAT3 is essential for myogenin differentiation. LIF\nmediates muscle cell differentiation by JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In\naddition, STAT3 may also induce myogenin differentiation through\nbiding to another transcription factor, MyoD. These results pro-\nvided a molecular basis for further understanding of the muscle\nregeneration mechanism.\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Cell cultures\n\nMouse MSC-derived C2C12 cells (American Type Culture collec-\ntion, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) with 20% fetal bovine serum (referred\nto herein after as growth medium or GM), 100 U/ml penicillin,\nand 100 lg/ml streptomycin in a 37 \ufffdC incubator with 5% CO2 for\nproliferation. To induce differentiation, growth medium was\nsubstituted by differentiation medium (Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle\u2019s medium containing 2% horse serum, or DM) when cells\nwere near confluent to allow the cells permanently withdraw from\ncell cycles, differentiate and fuse into myotube.\n\n2.2. Reagents and antibodies\n\nLIF was purchased from Chemicon, AG490 from Biomol, HGF\nfrom AMS/Immunoko ntact, and bFGF from Invitrogen. Antibodies\nused include the mouse monoclonal antibodies to actin (Sigma),\nJAK1 (Santa Cruz), STAT3, phosphorylated-STAT3 (Cell Signaling\nTechno logy), MHC (MF20, Developmental studies hybridoma\nbank), MyoD (Phar Mingen), Flag (m2, Sigma).\n\n2.3. Plasmid construction and transfection\n\nVarious expression vectors for Flag-tagged MyD, Flag-tagged\nSIX1 or Flag-tagged MEF2 were constructed by inserting PCR-gen-\nerated cDNA fragments into the mammalian expression vectors of\npcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All constructed clones were verified by\nsequencing. In DM 12 h, 5 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated onto\n12-well plates to reach 70\u201380% confluence and were transfected\nwith 200 ng of various plasmids as indicated in the figure legends\nusing LipofectAMINE 2000 (Sigma) in according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions. At 48 h after transfection, cells were extracted\nfor coimmunoprecipitation analysis followed by Western blot\nanalysis.\n\n2.4. siRNA and transfection\n\nAll Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized at Dharm-\nacon Inc. Sequences were as follows: for the STAT3 siRNA (human,\nsense), 50GAGUCCAAUGUCCU CUAUC; for the unrelated to STAT3-\nRNAi, 50AGACUUGACACUUCUCG CU; In GM or in DM 36 h,\n5 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated onto 12-well plates to reach\n70\u201380% confluence. Then cells were transfected with various siR-\nNAs of 100 nmol/L as indicated in the figure legends using Lipofect\nAMINE 2000. At 48 h after transfection, cells in DM 36 h were ex-\ntracted for Western blot analysis, while cells in GM were treated\nwith LIF (20 ng/ml) for 12 h before Western blot analysis.\n\n2.5. Coimmunoprecipitation\n\nTo examine the protein\u2013protein interaction in cultured C2C12\ncells,C2C12 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4,\n150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,\n1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml aprotinin and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). Four mil-\nligrams of anti-Flag antibody was first incubated with 300 lg of\ncell extracts in RIPA buffer overnight at 4 \ufffdC with rotation; 30 ll\nof protein A-Sepharose beads was then added, and the mixture\nwas incubated at 4 \ufffdC for 1 h with rotation. After extensive wash-\ning with the RIPA buffer, bound proteins were eluted out by boiling\nthen subjected to Western blot analysis.\n\n2.6. Western blot analysis\n\nTo examine expression levels of myosin heavy chain(MHC),\nstat3, phosphorylated-STAT3, b-actin, MyoD, Flag-myoD, Flag-\nMEF2, Flag-SIX1 and JAK1, C2C12 cells lysates in RIPA buffer was\ncentrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC and the supernatant\nwas used for the experiment. An aliquot (50 lg) of protein was\nseparated by 10% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)\nand electrotransferred onto 0.2-Am nitrocellulose membrane using\nTowbin transfer buffer (192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, 20% metha-\nnol, pH 8.3). The membrane was preincubated with PBS containing\n5% milk, and probed with monoclonal anti-MHC (1:1000), mono-\nclonal anti-actin (1:1000), monoclonal anti-STAT3, monoclonal\nanti-phosphorylated-STAT3 (1:1000), monoclonal anti-MyoD\n(1:1000), monoclonal anti-Flag, and monoclonal anti-JAK1\n(1:1000), in PBS containing 5% milk for 1h at room temperature.\nThe membrane was then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween\n20 and incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase\n(HP)-conjugated secondary antibody. After several washes, the blot\nwas developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent\n(ECL, sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. STAT3 is essential for myogenin differentiation\n\nTo identify signal pathway involved in differentiation process of\nmyogenesis, we examined the expression of STAT3 proteins in\nC2C12 myoblast when the C2C12 myoblast was shifted from GM\n\n\n\nFig. 2. LIF induced rapid phosphorylation of STAT3 in C2C12 cells.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of STAT3 and\nphosphorylated-STAT3 proteins increased upon differentiation,\ni.e., after the cells were transferred from GM to DM. To further\nidentify the role of STAT3 in myogenin differentiation, we knocked\ndown the endogenous STAT3 with small interference RNA in C2C12\ncells cultured in DM for 36 h (Fig. 1B). Compared to the control\ncells, the myogenic differentiation was markedly blocked in\nSTAT3-siRNA-transfected cells, as demonstrated by Western blot\nshowing the decreased expression of differentiation marker pro-\ntein\u2014myosin heavy chain (MHC). These results suggest that Stat3\nplays a critical role in the process of myogenesis differentiation.\n\n3.2. LIF induces rapid phosphorylation of STAT3 in C2C12 cells\n\nThe progresses of muscle regeneration are regulated by a vari-\nety of growth factors such as LIF, HGF, and bFGF [33,34]. Therefore,\nwe next examined which cytokines that activate STAT3 during\nmuscle differentiation. The C2C12 myoblast cells grown in the\nGM were treated with LIF (20 ng/ml), HGF (20 ng/ml), or bFGF\n(20 ng/ml). Although the expression levels of endogenous JAK1\nprotein or endogenous stat3 protein were comparable between\ncytokine-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2; top and center panels),\nthe levels of phosphorylated-STAT3 proteins were significantly in-\ncreased in LIF-treated cells compared to those treated with HGF or\nbFGF (top panel). These results indicate that LIF activates STAT3 by\ninducing rapid phosphorylation of STAT3.\n\n3.3. Jak2 mediates the effect of LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation\nduring myogenic differentiation\n\nTo test whether Jak2 is the down-stream protein of LIF to acti-\nvate STAT3 during normal myogenic differentiation, we assessed\nthe effect of a specific Jak2 inhibitor, AG490, on STAT3 activation\nby LIF in C2C12 cells that has been induced to differentiate in\nDM for 36 h. As shown in Fig. 3, in differentiated C1C12 cells,\nLIF-induced stat3 phosphorylation was repressed by pretreatment\nwith AG490 in a dose-dependent manner. AG490 pretreatment\nalso significantly inhibited myogenic differentiation as indicated\nby decreased expression of Myosin heavy chain (MHC). These\nresults demonstrate that LIF-induced differentiation of myogenesis\nthrough the signal pathway of JAK2/STAT3.\n\n3.4. STAT3 binded with MyoD in the stage of differentiation\n\nTo further elucidate the down-stream molecular mechanism\nunderlying the role of stat3 in myogenic differentiation, we exam-\nFig. 1. STAT3 is essential for myogenin differentiation. (A) The expression of STAT3\nand phosphorylated-stat3 protein significantly increased upon differentiation in\nC2C12 from GM to DM 48 h. (B) C2C12 cells were transfected with various RNAi as\nindicated. Stat3 was knocked down by RNAi and the expression of MHC decreased\nwith stat3-RNAi.

Stat3-RNAi: the STAT3-RNAi sequence was transfected into cells.\nWB: Western blot.\nined the role of several key transcription factors known to control\nthe expression of muscle-specific gene during myogenic differen-\ntiation, such as myoD, MEF2 and SIX1, in LIF-induced SATA3\nactivation. We transfected C2C12 cells with Flag-six1, Flag-\nMEF2, or Flag-myoD when the cells were cultured in DM for\n12 h. Proteins were prepared from the transfected cells, and ana-\nlyzed by coimmunoprecipitation using a flag-specific antibody\nand Western blot with an anti-stat3 antibody (Fig. 4; the top\npanel). As shown in Fig. 4 (the second top panel), stat3 protein\nwas detected in the cells transfected Flag-myoD, but not in those\ntransfected with Flag-MEF2 or Flag-six1. The data indicate that\nmyoD, but not MEF2 or six1, can directly interact with stat3 in\nmyogenic differentiation.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIt is important to understand the molecular mechanisms regu-\nlating muscle regeneration, a process involving proliferation, dif-\nferentiation, and survival of myoblasts. STAT3, a well-known\nfactor for its critical roles in transducing various and important\nbiological effects [5], has been found to be expressed in muscle,\nbut its role during muscle differentiation is poorly defined. By\nusing C2C12 cell-based in vitro muscle differentiation model, we\nfirst proved that both the expression level and activation of STAT3\nincrease upon C2C12 cells differentiation. We also showed that\nLIF-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signal transduction pathway induces\nmyogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we found that STAT3 could\ndirectly interact with myoD, suggesting that myoD might be in-\nvolved in STAT3-induced myogenic differentiation.\nFig. 3. Jak2 specially mediated the effect of STAT3 during myogenic differentiation.\nAG490, a specific Jak2 inhibitor, was able to inhibit STAT3 activation induced by LIF.\nAfter cells were pretreated with AG490 in a dose-dependent manner as indicated\nfor 30 min and then treated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, the level of expression of\nphosphorylated-stat3 (the top panel) decreased. And the differentiation of the cells\nwas determined by examining the expression of MHC protein as indicated (the\ncenter panel).\n\n\n\nFig. 4. STAT3 bonded with myoD in the stage of differentiation. C2C12 cell were\nrespectively transfected with Flag-six1, Flag- MEF2 or Flag-myoD. Twelve hours\nafter transfection, cells extracts were subjected to coimmunoprecipitated with\nantibodies against anti-Flag antibody. First the immunoprecipitated (IP) Flag-six1,\nFlag-MEF2, Flag-myoD were detected by Western blot (WB) with anti-Flag antibody\n(the top panel).The transfected plasmids all existed in the cells. Next, the cells\nlysates were subjected to WB with antibodies against stat3 (the second top panel).\nStat3 protein was detected only in the cells transfected Flag-myoD. Furthermore,\nthe cells lysates were subjected to WB with antibodies against endogenous stat3 or\nendogenous actin. The levels of the endogenous stat3 and endogenous actin were\nequal revealed by WB (two bottom panels).\n\n140 Y. Yang et al. / Cytokine 46 (2009) 137\u2013141\nThe role for STAT3 in myoblast differentiation was further con-\nfirmed by STAT3 knockdown experiment using siRNA, in which\ndeliberate knockdown of endogenous STAT3 dramatically blocked\nmyogenic differentiation. The role of STAT3 in cell growth and dif-\nferentiation is divergent according to the cellular background, the\ntype of cytokines that activates STAT3 and the type of nuclear pro-\nteins that interacts with STAT3. It has been reported that STAT3\ninduces differentiation in some cell lines such as macrophage,\nB-cell, osteosarcoma cell line, astrocyte and cardiac stem cells\n[12\u201317], but suppresses differentiation and promotes cell growth\nin others [7\u201311].\n\nWe observed that LIF-activated JAK2/STAT3 induces myogenic\ndifferentiation. However, a previous report showed that LIF-med-\niated ERK phosphorylation inhibits myogenic differentiation [35].\nIn this study, the inhibitory effect of LIF was detected only in the\nfirst 12 h after the cells are incubated in the DM, which is STAT3-\nindependnt. Thus, it possible that LIF might play distinct roles in\ndifferent stages of muscle differentiation. Cytokines may require\ncritical time frame to mediate activation of signal pathway. For\nexample, there is a critical time window (16\u201320 h) for bFGF to\nactivate ERK and to repress myogenic gene expression and differ-\nentiation [36]. These data raise a possibility that LIF may inhibit\nmuscle differentiation by ERK pathway at the early stage (within\n12 h), but enhance differentiation through JAK2/STAT3 pathway\nlater.\n\nSTAT3, as a key signal transducer and activator of transcription,\nhas been shown to interact with various nuclear proteins and\ntransduce important biological effects in many cell lines. SIX1,\nMEF2 and MyoD are key myogenic regulatory factors inducing plu-\nripotent precursor cells differentiation. So we tested whether they\nwere involved in stat3 mediated myogenic differentiation. The re-\nsults showed that stat3 could interact with myoD, but not SIX1 or\nMEF2 in C2C12 cells in DM for 12 h, suggesting that STAT3-MyoD\nbinding may be responsible for the stimulatory effect of STAT3\non myogenic differentiation. Further studies are needed to under-\nstand how STAT3 coordinates with myoD to control myogenic\ndifferentiation and how they cross-talk with other signaling path-\nways. Taken together, our data suggest a possibility to accelerate\nmuscle regeneration by modulating STAT3 pathways.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by a Grant from National Nature Sci-\nence Foundation of China (No. 30671091) and another Grant from\nNational Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 30600098).\nReferences\n\n[1] Rawls A, Olson EN.

In this study, we identi-\nfied, via in vivo-induced antigen technology, an E. tarda antigen, Eta1, and analyzed its function in a Japanese flounder\n(Paralichthys olivaceus) model. Eta1 is composed of 226 residues and shares homology with putative bacterial adhesins. Quanti-\ntative real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that when cultured in vitro, eta1 expression was growth phase\ndependent and reached maximum at mid-logarithmic phase. During infection of flounder lymphocytes, eta1 expression was\ndrastically increased at the early stage of infection. Compared to the wild type, the eta1-defective mutant, TXeta1, was unaffected\nin growth but exhibited attenuated overall virulence, reduced tissue dissemination and colonization capacity, and impaired abil-\nity to invade flounder lymphocytes and to block the immune response of host cells. The lost virulence of TXeta1 was restored\nwhen a functional eta1 gene was reintroduced into the strain. Western blot and immunodetection analyses showed that Eta1 is\nlocalized to the outer membrane and exposed on the surface of E. tarda and that recombinant Eta1 (rEta1) was able to interact\nwith flounder lymphocytes. Consistent with these observations, antibody blocking of Eta1 inhibited E. tarda infection at the\ncellular level. Furthermore, when used as a subunit vaccine, rEta1 induced strong protective immunity in flounder against lethal\nE. tarda challenge. Taken together, these results indicate that Eta1 is an in vivo-induced antigen that mediates pathogen-host\ninteraction and, as a result, is required for optimal bacterial infection.\n\nEdwardsiella tarda is a Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped bac-terium of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is a pathogen with a\nbroad host range that includes fish, birds, reptiles, and humans. E.\ntarda infection of humans can cause gastrointestinal symptoms\nand other disorders, such as myonecrosis and wound infections\n(9, 21). In aquaculture, E. tarda is considered a severe pathogen\nbecause of its ability to infect a wide range of marine and freshwa-\nter fish, including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), tur-\nbot (Scophtalmus maximus), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), eels\n(Anguilla japonica), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) (17,\n37). E. tarda infection of fish may lead to the development of a\nsystemic disease called edwardsiellosis, which in Japanese floun-\nder is often manifested in hemorrhage, septicemia, skin lesions,\nand necrosis of liver, gut, and kidney (19, 26).\n\nFunctional studies have identified a number of E. tarda systems\nand factors that are involved in pathogenesis (14, 24). It is known\nthat E. tarda enters host fish through the gastrointestinal tract, the\ngills, and the body surface and is able to resist the immune defense\nmediated by host complements and phagocytes (16, 23). Studies\nin fish models, such as blue gourami and flounder, have indicated\nthat effective E. tarda infection requires two virulence-associated\nsystems, i.e., type III (T3SS) and type VI (T6SS) secretion systems,\nwhich are vital to E. tarda invasion and intracellular replication\n(22, 35, 42, 46). Other factors known to be involved in E. tarda\npathogenicity are hemolysin (8, 29, 40, 41), catalase (25), super-\noxide dismutase (4), heat shock proteins (5, 6), Dps (47), and the\nLuxS/AI-2 quorum-sensing system (43, 44). A recent study based\non genomic subtractive hybridization identified an autotrans-\nporter adhesin, AIDA, in atypical strains of fish-pathogenic E.\ntarda (27). However, the precise functions of these virulence fac-\ntors during E. tarda infection and the mechanism of disease oc-\ncurrence are unclear.\n\nIn previous studies, we have utilized the approach of in vivo-\n\ninduced antigen technology (IVIAT) to discover potential viru-\nlence factors associated with E. tarda infection (10, 11). In the\ncurrent study, we examined the biological properties and function\nof a putative adhesin, Eta1, identified via IVIAT. We found that\nexpression of eta1 was drastically enhanced during infection of\nhost cells and that mutation of eta1 attenuates E. tarda virulence at\nthe cellular and tissue levels. In addition, we also observed inter-\naction between recombinant Eta1 and host lymphocytes, and\nblocking of this interaction inhibits the infectivity of E. tarda.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and growth conditions. E. coli BL21, BL21(DE3), and\nDH5\ufffd were purchased from Tiangen (Beijing, China). E. coli S17-1\ufffdpir\nwas purchased from Biomedal (Sevilla, Spain). E. tarda TX01 was isolated\nfrom the kidneys of diseased flounder (31) and is naturally resistant to\nrifampin. All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) (28) at 37\u00b0C\n(for E. coli) or 28\u00b0C (for E. tarda). Where indicated, appropriate antibiot-\nics were supplemented as follows: chloramphenicol, 30 \ufffdg/ml; polymyxin\nB, 100 \ufffdg/ml; and rifampin, 20 \ufffdg/ml. All antibiotics were purchased\nfrom Sangon, Shanghai, China.\n\nFish used for infection study. Japanese flounder (average weight, 12.1\ng) were purchased from a local fish farm and maintained at 22\u00b0C in aer-\nated seawater. The fish were acclimatized in the laboratory for 2 weeks\n\nReceived 24 January 2012 Returned for modification 16 February 2012\nAccepted 4 May 2012\n\nPublished ahead of print 14 May 2012\n\nEditor: B.

The putative amino acid\nsequence of Eta1 was analyzed using the BLAST program at the National\nCenter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Expert Protein\nAnalysis System. Domain search was performed with the conserved do-\nmain search program of NCBI. The signal peptide search was performed\nwith SignalP 3.0. The theoretical molecular mass and theoretical isoelec-\ntric point were predicted using EditSeq in the DNASTAR software pack-\nage (Madison, WI).\n\nPreparation of flounder HK lymphocytes. To prepare flounder head\nkidney (HK) lymphocytes, HK was removed from three flounder (average\nweight, 796 g) under aseptic conditions and washed 3 times with phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 U of penicillin and strepto-\nmycin (Solarbio, Beijing, China). The tissue was passed through a metal\nmesh, and the cell suspension was overlaid on 1.070 and 1.077 discontin-\nuous density of Percoll solution (Solarbio, Beijing, China). After centrif-\nugation at 300 \ufffd g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the interface fraction containing\nlymphocytes was collected and washed 3 times with PBS. The lymphocytes\nwere resuspended in L-15 medium (Thermo Scientific HyClone, Beijing,\nChina), and the viability of the cells was examined by the trypan blue dye\nexclusion method. The cells were adjusted to 2 \ufffd 105 viable cells/ml in\nL-15, distributed into 96-well tissue culture plates, and cultured at 22\u00b0C.\n\nqRT-PCR analysis of eta1 expression. To examine eta1 expression in\nLB medium, E. tarda TX01 was grown in LB medium at 28\u00b0C to optical\ndensities at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.25, 0.5, 0.9, 1.25, and 1.5. The cells were\nharvested by centrifugation and used for total RNA extraction with an HP\nTotal RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek). One microgram of total RNA was used\nfor cDNA synthesis with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA). Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-\nPCR) was carried out as described previously (48) in an Eppendorf Mas-\ntercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the SYBR ExScript\nqRT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) with 16S rRNA as a reference, as\ndescribed previously (43). The PCR primers for eta1 were RT-F1 (5=-GT\nCAGGAAAGTGATTGGTGGC-3=) and RT-R1 (5=-TCCAATACTCCTT\nCTCGGTGC-3=). The PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene were 16S933F\n(5=-GCACAAGCGGTGGAGCAT-3=) and 16SRTR2 (5=-GCCATGCAG\nCACCTGTCTC-3=). The PCR analysis was performed four times. All data\nare given in terms of relative mRNA expressed as means plus or minus\nstandard errors of the means (SE).\n\nTo examine eta1 expression during infection of host cells, TX01 was\ncultured in LB medium to an OD600 of 0.8; the cells were collected by\ncentrifugation and resuspended in PBS to 107 CFU/ml. For cellular infec-\ntion, TX01 (106 CFU/well) was added to HK lymphocytes cultured in\n96-well culture plates (105 cells/well) or, as controls, to 96-well culture\nplates containing L-15 medium without lymphocytes. The plates were\nincubated at 25\u00b0C for 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h at 25\u00b0C. After the\nincubation, the plates containing lymphocytes were washed 3 times with\nPBS to remove unattached bacteria, and the cells were then used for total\nRNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis of eta1 expression as described\nabove. The TX01 in the control plates was collected by centrifugation and\nused for total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis as described above.\n\nPlasmid and strain construction. To construct pEtEta1, which ex-\npresses eta1, eta1 was amplified by PCR with primers 81F1 (5=-CGCATA\nTGGAGAATAATTTACTCGGCGA-3= [underlined sequence, NdeI site])\nand 81R1 (5=-CTCGAGTTCCCCCACTTCCTTATTTCT-3= [underlined\nsequence, XhoI site]); the PCR products were ligated with the T-A cloning\nvector pBS-T (Tiangen, Beijing, China), resulting in pBSEta1, which was\ndigested with NdeI/XhoI, and the fragment containing eta1 was retrieved\nand inserted into pET258 (32) between NdeI and XhoI sites. To construct\nthe eta1-defective strain TXeta1, an internal fragment of eta1 (positions 67\nto 303) was generated by PCR with primers KOF1 (5=-GGATCCGCACA\nATCCTAGAATCAGTA-3= [underlined sequence, BamHI site]) and\nKOR1 (5=-GGATCCTAACTTCCATTGGCTATCT-3= [underlined se-\n\nquence, BamHI site]). The PCR products were inserted into the suicide\nplasmid pDM4 (18) at the compatible BglII site, resulting in pDMEta1.\nS17-1\ufffdpir was transformed with pDMEta1, and the transformants were\nconjugated with TX01 as described previously (43). The transconjugants\nwere selected on LB agar plates supplemented with polymyxin B and\nchloramphenicol. One of the selected mutants was named TXeta1. Muta-\ntion of eta1 in TXeta1 was confirmed by PCR analysis and subsequent\nsequencing of the PCR products and by Western blot analysis. To con-\nstruct TXeta1C, pBSEta1 was digested with NdeI/XhoI, and the fragment\ncontaining eta1 was retrieved and inserted into the expression plasmid\npBT3 (45) between NdeI and XhoI sites, resulting in pBT3Eta1. TXeta1\nwas transformed with pBT3Eta1 via electroporation, and the transfor-\nmants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (re-\nsistance marker of pBT3Eta1). One of the transformants was named\nTXeta1C.\n\nPurification of recombinant protein and preparation of antiserum.\nRecombinant Eta1 (rEta1) was purified as follows. E. coli BL21(DE3) was\ntransformed with pEtEta1; the transformants were cultured in LB me-\ndium at 37\u00b0C to mid-logarithmic phase, and expression of eta1 was in-\nduced by adding isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final\nconcentration of 1 mM. After growing at 37\u00b0C for an additional 5 h, the\ncells were harvested by centrifugation, and His-tagged rEta1 was purified\nunder native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (GE\nHealthcare, Piscataway, NJ) as recommended by the manufacturer. The\npurified protein was dialyzed in PBS and concentrated with Amicon Ultra\nCentrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated\nprotein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-\ntrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized after staining with Coomassie\nbrilliant blue R-250. The concentration of the protein was determined\nusing the Bradford method (3) with bovine serum albumin as the stan-\ndard. Preparation of rat anti-rEta1 serum and determination of the titers\nand specificities of anti-rEta1 antibodies were performed as described\npreviously (32).\n\nDetermination of the subcellular location of Eta1. (i) Western blot-\nting. TX01 and TXeta1 were grown in LB medium to an OD600 of 0.5 and\nharvested by centrifugation at 6,000 \ufffd g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Extracellular\nproteins were prepared by concentrating the supernatant 100 times using\nAmicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cyto-\nplasmic and periplasmic proteins were prepared as reported previously\n(45). To prepare outer membrane proteins, the cell pellet was washed 3\ntimes with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold buffer I (50 mM Tris \u00b7 Cl, 1\nmM EDTA, pH 7.5). The cells were broken by sonication on ice, followed\nby centrifugation as described above. The supernatant was collected and\ncentrifuged at 100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1\nM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothre-\nitol (DTT), and 2% Sarkosyl and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with mixing\nevery 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C,\nand the pellet was resuspended in buffer I. The concentration of the pu-\nrified proteins was determined using the Bradford method (3). Western\nblotting was performed as follows. The proteins were subjected to electro-\nphoresis in 0.1% SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the\nproteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes\nwere blocked for 3 h with 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA)-0.1%\n(wt/vol) azide-PBS containing 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (PBS-T), fol-\nlowed by washing with PBS-T three times. The blocked membranes were\nincubated for 2 h with antiserum against rEta1 or antiserum against re-\ncombinant LuxS (rLuxS), an intracellular protein of E. tarda (43). The\nantisera were diluted in PBS-T containing 2% (wt/vol) BSA to 1/500. The\nmembranes were washed three times with PBS-T. Primary antibodies\nwere detected by incubating the membranes with anti-rat IgG-horserad-\nish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Tiangen, Beijing, China) (1/1,000 dilu-\ntion in PBS-T) for 1 h in PBS-T\u2013BSA. The membranes were washed three\ntimes with PBS-T, and the antibody was detected with the HRP-DAB kit\n(Tiangen, Beijing, China). The color reaction was stopped after 30 min by\nseveral washes with water, and the membranes were air dried.\n\nAn E. tarda Antigen Involved in Host Infection\n\nAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2949\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\n(ii) immunofluorescence study. TX01 and TXeta1 were cultured in\nLB medium to an OD600 of 0.5. The cells were washed and diluted in PBS\nto 108 CFU/ml. Three hundred microliters of bacterial suspension was\ndropped onto a glass slide, and the slide was incubated at room tempera-\nture for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min,\nfollowed by washing 3 times with PBS. Rat anti-rEta1 serum, preimmune\nserum, and rat anti-rLuxS serum were diluted 500 times in PBS, and 300\n\ufffdl diluted serum was added to the bacterial cells on the slide. The slide was\nincubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h and washed 3 times with PBS. Fluorescein iso-\nthiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Bioss, Beijing, China) was\ndiluted 1,000 times, and 300 \ufffdl of the diluted antibody was added to the\nslide. The slide was incubated and washed as described above and ob-\nserved with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon E800; Japan).\n\nTissue dissemination and mortality analysis. For tissue dissemina-\ntion analysis, TXeta1, TXeta1C, and TX01 were cultured in LB medium to\nan OD600 of 0.8. The cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in\nseawater. Japanese flounder were divided randomly into four groups (n \ufffd\n35) and immersed in seawater containing or not containing (control) 108\n\nCFU/ml of TXeta1, TXeta1C, or TX01. The blood, liver, kidney, and\nspleen were taken aseptically from the fish (five from each group) at 12 h\npostinfection. Bacterial recovery from the tissues was determined as re-\nported previously (43). The rest of the infected fish were monitored daily\nfor mortality for 20 days.\n\nE. tarda infection of host cells and bacterial-recovery analysis. To\nexamine E. tarda infection, TXeta1 and TX01 were cultured in LB me-\ndium to an OD600 of 0.8. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in\nL-15 to 107 CFU/ml. HK lymphocytes cultured in 96-well cell culture\nplates were supplemented with TXeta1 or TX01 (106 CFU/well). The\nplates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h, followed by washing\n3 times with PBS. The cells were incubated with penicillin and streptomy-\ncin (100 U) for 2 h at 25\u00b0C to kill extracellular bacteria. Bacterial recovery\nwas determined as reported previously (43). The experiment was per-\nformed four times.\n\nqRT-PCR analysis of the expression of immune genes in E. tarda-\ninfected flounder. Flounder were infected with TXeta1 or TX01 as de-\nscribed above for tissue dissemination analysis. Total RNA was extracted\nfrom HK at 1 h and 4 h postinfection with an HP Total RNA kit (Omega\nBio-Tek) and used for qRT-PCR as described above with 18S rRNA and\nubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCE) as internal references (48). The\nprimers used to amplify the genes of interleukin 1\ufffd (IL-1\ufffd), IL-6, IL-8,\ngamma interferon (IFN-\ufffd), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\ufffd), inter-\nferon-induced Mx protein (Mx), major histocompatibility complex\n(MHC) class I\ufffd, CD40, and CD8\ufffd have been reported previously (12).\n\nInteraction between rEta1 and flounder lymphocytes. Flounder HK\nlymphocytes (\ufffd105) were placed onto a glass slide, and the slide was\nincubated at room temperature for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by washing 3 times with PBS.\nThree hundred microliters of 10 \ufffdM rEta1 or recombinant EthR, an in-\ntracellular protein of E. tarda (40), was added to the lymphocytes, fol-\nlowed by incubation at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. After the incubation, the slide was\nwashed 3 times with PBS and supplemented with 300 \ufffdl of 1/1,000 mouse\nanti-His antibody (Bioss, Beijing, China) or serum from an unvaccinated\nmouse (negative-control serum). The slide was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h\nand washed as described above, followed by adding 300 \ufffdl of 1/1,000\nFITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Bioss, Beijing, China). The slide was\nincubated and washed as described above and observed with a fluores-\ncence microscope (Nikon E800, Japan). The ability of anti-His antibody\nto react with rEthR was demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis\n(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).\n\nEffect of anti-Eta1 antibodies on E. tarda infection. TX01 was di-\nluted in PBS to 108 CFU/ml. Anti-Eta1 serum and preimmune serum were\ndiluted 1,000 times, 500 times, and 100 times in PBS. TX01 suspension\nwas mixed with each of the diluted sera at an equal volume, followed by\nincubation at room temperature for 0.5 h. As a control, TX01 was mixed\nand incubated in the same manner with an equal volume of PBS. After the\n\nincubation, the TX01-containing mixture was added to flounder HK lym-\nphocytes cultured in 96-well cell culture plates as described above (5 \ufffd 105\n\nCFU bacterial cells/well). The plates were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 4 h, fol-\nlowed by washing 3 times with PBS. The number of bacterial cells associ-\nated with lymphocytes was determined as described above by plate count.\nThe assay was performed four times.\n\nVaccination. rEta1 was resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 200\n\ufffdg/ml and mixed at an equal volume with aluminum hydroxide as de-\nscribed previously (12). As a control, PBS was also mixed similarly with\naluminum hydroxide without rEta1 (PBS-aluminum hydroxide). Floun-\nder (as described above) were divided randomly into two groups (n \ufffd 35)\nand injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 \ufffdl of rEta1 suspension or\nPBS-aluminum hydroxide (control). At 1 month postvaccination, 25 fish\nwere taken from each group and challenged via i.p. injection with 100 \ufffdl\nTX01 that had been cultured as described above to an OD600 of 0.8,\nwashed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS to 2 \ufffd 106 CFU/ml. The fish\nwere monitored for mortality for a period of 20 days. Dying fish (5 from\nthe PBS-injected group and 3 from the rEta1-vaccinated group) were\nexamined for bacterial recovery from liver, kidney, and spleen as de-\nscribed above (see \u201cTissue dissemination and mortality analysis\u201d). The\nrelative percent survival (RPS) was calculated according to the following\nformula: RPS \ufffd [1 \t (percent mortality in vaccinated fish/percent mor-\ntality in control fish)] \ufffd 100 (1). The vaccination trial was conducted in\nduplicate.\n\nELISA. Sera were taken from vaccinated fish and control fish at 4\nweeks postvaccination and diluted 20-fold in PBS. Serum antibody\nagainst rEta1 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) analysis as described previously (34).\n\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) of the SPSS 15.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In\nall cases, the significance level was defined as a P value of \n 0.05.\n\nNucleotide sequence accession number. The nucleotide sequence of\neta1 has been deposited in the GenBank database under accession number\nJN802138.\n\nRESULTS\nCharacterization of the sequence of Eta1. The deduced amino\nacid sequence of Eta1 contains 226 amino acid residues and is\npredicted to have a molecular mass of 23.6 kDa and an isoelectric\npoint of 4.7. In silico analysis identified no apparent conserved\ndomain in Eta1. No putative signal peptide sequence was found in\nEta1. BLAST analysis showed that Eta1 shares the highest se-\nquence identities (60% and 53%, respectively) with the C-termi-\nnal 217-residue region of the putative adhesins of Erwinia sp.\nstrain Ejp617 (GenBank accession no. ADP11523) and Escherichia\ncoli strain CL3 serovar O113:H21 pathogenicity island I (GenBank\naccession no. AAQ19127). These data suggest the possibility that\nEta1 is a novel type of adhesin.\n\neta1 expression under in vitro conditions and during infec-\ntion. To examine eta1 expression under in vitro conditions, E.\ntarda TX01 was cultured in LB medium to OD600 of 0.25, 0.5, 0.9,\n1.25, and 1.5, and eta1 expression was determined by qRT-PCR.\nThe results showed that eta1 expression peaked at an OD600 of 0.5\nand dropped afterward, reaching the lowest level at OD600 of 1.25\nand 1.5 (Fig. 1A). Compared to the expression level at an OD600 of\n0.25, which, for convenience of comparison, was set as 1, the ex-\npression levels at OD600 of 0.5, 0.9, 1.25, and 1.5 were 2.3-, 0.7-,\n0.5-, and 0.5-fold, respectively. To examine eta1 expression during\ninfection, flounder HK lymphocytes were infected with TX01, and\neta1 expression was determined by qRT-PCR at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h,\nand 5 h postinfection. The results showed that, compared to eta1\nexpression before infection (0 h), eta1 expression after infection\nwas significantly induced and reacheda maximum (69-fold) at 1 h\n\nSun et al.\n\n2950 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=JN802138\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=ADP11523\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=AAQ19127\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\npostinfection (Fig. 1B). The eta1 expression level dropped as in-\nfection progressed but remained significantly higher at 2 h and 3 h\npostinfection than before infection. In contrast, in TX01 incu-\nbated under the same conditions but without host cells, no appar-\nent alteration in eta1 expression was observed at all the examined\ntime points.\n\nSubcellular localization of Eta1. To examine the subcellular\nlocalization of Eta1, TX01 was cultured in LB medium to an OD600\nof 0.5, which, as shown above, is the growth point at which a\nrelatively high level of eta1 expression was observed. Proteins were\nprepared from the cytoplasm, periplasm, outer membrane, and\nextracellular fractions of the culture and subjected to Western blot\nanalysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant\nEta1 (rEta1), which was prepared as a His-tagged protein from E.\ncoli (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). The results showed\nthat Eta1 was found in the preparations of the cytoplasm,\nperiplasm, and outer membrane proteins but not in that of the\nextracellular proteins (Fig. 2A and B). To examine whether the\nouter membrane preparation had been contaminated with cyto-\nplasmic proteins, the preparations of the outer membrane and\ncytoplasmic proteins were blotted with antibodies against recom-\nbinant LuxS (rLuxS), a cytoplasmic protein of E. tarda (43). The\nresults showed that LuxS was detected in the cytoplasmic prepa-\nration but not in the outer membrane preparation (Fig. 2C), sug-\ngesting that the outer membrane faction was not contaminated\nwith cytoplasmic proteins. These results indicated that the Eta1\nobserved in the outer membrane preparation was most likely due\nto natural outer membrane localization. To further examine\n\nwhether Eta1 was exposed on the cell surface, TX01 was incubated\nwith rat anti-rEta1 serum or preimmune serum, and the bound\nantibodies were detected with FITC-labeled goat anti-rat IgG.\nSubsequent microscopic examination showed that fluorescence\nwas detected in TX01 treated with anti-rEta1 serum, but not in\nTX01 treated with preimmune serum (Fig. 3). In contrast, TX01\ntreated with antibodies against rLuxS failed to show fluorescence.\nThese results suggest that Eta1 was exposed on the surface of E.\ntarda and able to interact with anti-rEta1 antibodies.\n\nEffect of eta1 mutation. (i) Effect on tissue dissemination and\ngeneral bacterial virulence. To examine the biological impor-\ntance of Eta1, a genetic variant of TX01, TXeta1, which bears an\ninsertion mutation at eta1, was constructed. Western blot analysis\nshowed that, unlike the wild type, TXeta1 was unable to produce\nEta1 (Fig. 2B). Compared to the wild-type strain TX01, TXeta1\nwas unaffected in growth when cultured in LB medium. To exam-\nine whether the eta81 mutation affected pathogenicity, flounder\nwere infected via immersion with or without (control) TXeta1 or\nTX01, and bacterial infection of host tissues was analyzed by bac-\nterial-recovery analysis, which showed that at 12 h postinfection,\nthe numbers of bacterial cells recovered from the blood, liver,\nkidney, and spleen of TXeta1-infected fish were significantly less\nthan those recovered from TX01-infected fish (Fig. 4A). No bac-\nteria were recovered from the control fish. These results suggest\nthat TXeta1 was impaired in its ability to disseminate into and\ncolonize host tissues. Furthermore, in TX01-infected fish, mortal-\nity began to occur at 3 days postinfection, and 90% accumulated\nmortality was reached before the fish became stabilized, whereas in\nTXeta1-infected fish, no mortality was observed (Fig. 4B). In contrast\nto TXeta1, TXeta1C, a variant of TXeta1 that expresses eta1 in trans\nfrom a plasmid, was able to disseminate into and colonize flounder\ntissues and to cause mortality in the infected fish in a manner similar\nto that of TX01 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the defect in the virulence of\nTXeta1 could be rescued by eta1 complementation.\n\n(ii) Effect on infection of host cells and on cellular immune\nresponse. To examine the effect of eta1 mutation on the infectivity\n\nFIG 1 Expression of eta1 under different conditions.

The results showed that bacterial recovery rates from\nTXeta1-infected cells at all the examined time points were sig-\nnificantly lower than those from TX01-infected cells (Fig. 5).\nqRT-PCR analysis of immune gene expression in flounder HK\nat 1 h and 4 h after TXeta1 and TX01 infection showed that,\ncompared to TX01, which is known to inhibit the host immune\n\nresponse, TXeta1 infection induced a significant increase in the\nexpression of IL-1\ufffd, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\ufffd, IFN-\ufffd, Mx, MHCI\ufffd,\nCD8\ufffd, and CD40 in a manner that was dependent on the in-\nfection time (Fig. 6).\n\nBinding of recombinant rEta1 to flounder lymphocytes.\nSince Eta1 is a surface-exposed protein and its production is re-\nquired for effective infection of host cells, we wondered whether\nEta1 was capable of direct interaction with host cells. To investi-\ngate this question, the His-tagged rEta1 or rEthR, an intracellular\nE. tarda protein prepared under the same conditions as those un-\nder which rEta1 was prepared, was incubated with flounder HK\nlymphocytes, and the cells were subsequently subjected to fluores-\ncence immunodetection with anti-His antibody or serum from an\nunvaccinated mouse (control serum). The results showed that for\ncells treated with anti-His antibody, fluorescence was detected in\ncells preincubated with rEta1, but not in cells preincubated with\nrEthR (Fig. 7). In contrast, for cells treated with the control serum,\n\nFIG 3 Exposure of Eta1 on the surface of E. tarda.

To fur-\nther examine whether the interaction between Eta1 and host cells\nwas required for bacterial infection, flounder HK lymphocytes\nwere infected with TX01 in the presence or absence of anti-rEta1\nserum or preimmune serum in different dilutions. The results\nshowed that the presence of anti-rEta1 serum significantly re-\nduced the number of bacterial cells that invaded lymphocytes in a\nmanner that was dependent on the dose of the antiserum (Fig. 8).\nIn contrast, the presence of preimmune serum had no effect on\ncellular infection.\n\nImmunoprotective potential of rEta1. The above results, i.e.,\nthat Eta1 is a surface-exposed protein that is highly induced dur-\ning infection and interacts directly with host cells, led us to wonder\nwhether rEta1 could induce protective immunity if used as a vac-\ncine. To examine this possibility, flounder were vaccinated with\nrEta1 and challenged with a lethal dose of TX01 at 4 weeks post-\nvaccination. The fish were subsequently monitored for mortality\nfor 20 days, and the results showed that the accumulated mortal-\n\nities of rEta1-vaccinated fish and the control fish were 12% and\n72%, respectively. Hence, the protective efficacy, in terms of RPS,\nof rEta1 was 83.3%. Comparable results were obtained in the du-\nplicate vaccination trial. Microbiological examination of dying\nfish indicated that TX01 was the only type of bacterium recovered\nfrom the liver, spleen, and blood of the fish, suggesting that mor-\ntality was caused by TX01 infection. ELISA analysis showed that\nspecific serum antibodies were produced in rEta1-vaccinated fish\n(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). These results indicate\nthat rEta1 is a protective antigen.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we analyzed the function of an in vivo-induced an-\ntigen, Eta1, from the pathogenic E. tarda strain TX01 isolated\nfrom diseased flounder. Expression analysis showed that when\nTX01 was cultured under in vitro conditions in the rich LB me-\ndium, the eta1 expression level changed with the growth phase.\nHowever, the magnitude of the change was relatively small, as the\npeak expression level was only 4.6-fold that of the bottom level. In\ncontrast, expression of eta1 was significantly induced during in-\nfection of host lymphocytes, particularly at the early stage of in-\n\nFIG 6 Effect of TXeta1 and TX01 infection on the expression of immune\ngenes.

These results indicate that eta1 expression is strongly in-\nduced during the process of host cell invasion, which is consistent\nwith the identification of Eta1 as an in vivo-induced antigen in the\nfirst place, and they suggest a potential involvement of Eta1 in host\ninfection.\n\nTo examine whether Eta1 was required for E. tarda pathogen-\nesis, an Eta1-deficient mutant, TXeta1, was constructed. TXeta1\nwas comparable to the wild type in growth when cultured in LB\nmedium, suggesting that Eta1 is not an essential protein during in\nvitro growth. It is known that E. tarda possesses a strong tissue\ninvasion and dissemination capacity that enables the pathogen to\novercome the innate immunity barrier and eventually reach the\ninternal organs of the host (16, 33). In this study, we found that\nfollowing immersion infection of flounder, both TXeta1 and\nTX01 were able to spread to the liver and spleen; however, the\nnumbers of TXeta1 bacteria recovered from these tissues were\nmore than 10-fold less than those of recovered TX01, suggesting\nthat mutation of eta1 impairs the ability of TXeta1 to disseminate\ninto and colonize host tissues. Consistent with these observations,\nTX01 infection induced 90% accumulated mortality, while no\nmortality was observed in TXeta1-infected fish. These results in-\ndicate that TXeta1 was attenuated in overall virulence. The obser-\nvation that introduction of a functional eta1 gene into TXeta1\nrestored the virulence of TXeta1 suggests that the virulence atten-\nuation of TXeta1 was indeed due to eta1 mutation. In agreement\nwith these observations made in a live-fish model, cellular-infec-\ntion analysis showed that, compared to TX01, TXeta1 exhibited\nsignificantly reduced ability to invade host lymphocytes.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that one of the prominent viru-\nlence features of E. tarda is its capacity to interfere with the normal\nimmune response of host phagocytes, and this capacity is essential\nto the intracellular survival of E. tarda (23, 47). In this study, we\nfound that the expression profiles of the immune genes in TX01-\nand TXeta1-infected flounder HK differed remarkably. Com-\npared to TX01, TXeta1 stimulated the expression of a wide spec-\ntrum of immune genes that are involved in proinflammatory and\nspecific immune responses, which probably accounts for the re-\nsistance of the host to TXeta1 infection. Hence, it appears that\nunlike the wild-type TX01, the eta1-defective mutant TXeta1 is no\nlonger able to inhibit the general immune response of the host.\n\nAccumulating studies have indicated that for many human\npathogens, adhesins play a vital role in infection by mediating host\ncell adhesion and invasion (7, 15, 20, 30, 36). These proteins bind\nto receptors on the surfaces of host cells, thereby facilitating bac-\nterial translocation into the targeted cells (13). In our study, we\nfound that recombinant Eta1 was localized to the cell surface.\nSince no apparent signal peptide was identified in Eta1, it is pos-\nsible that translocation of Eta1 may be through a nonclassical\npathway. Eta1 was able to interact with flounder lymphocytes,\nwhich, together with the observation that Eta1 expression was\nupregulated during lymphocyte infection, suggests a possibility\nfor Eta1 to act as an adhesin. Consistent with this hypothesis, the\npresence of anti-rEta1 antibodies reduced TX01 invasion into\nlymphocytes. Since preimmune serum had no effect on TX01 in-\nfection, it is likely that the reduced infectivity of TX01 observed\nin the presence of anti-rEta1 antibodies is due to specific binding\nof the antibodies to Eta1 on the pathogen, which may have masked\nthe region of Eta1 that is essential to host cell interaction.\n\nIt is known that in some bacterial pathogens, surface proteins,\nsuch as invasins, that are involved in direct interactions with the\n\nhost system possess vaccine properties (2, 38, 39). In our study, we\nfound that rEta1 induced a protection rate of 83.3% upon lethal E.\ntarda challenge, suggesting that rEta1 is a strong protective im-\nmunogen. The immunoprotective property of rEta1 is in line with\nits virulence role played during infection. It is likely that, as shown\nby ELISA analysis, vaccination of rEta1 induced production of\nspecific antibodies, which upon E. tarda infection bind to the in-\nfected pathogen via Eta1, which is highly expressed in vivo and\nlocalized on the cell surface. Since Eta1 is essential to effective host\ncell infection, binding of Eta1 by its antibodies very likely inter-\nferes with the normal function of Eta1, as was observed under in\nvitro conditions with flounder lymphocytes, resulting in a marked\nelevation in the survival rate of the vaccinated fish.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study indicate that Eta1 is an in\nvivo-induced antigen that is highly expressed upon encountering\nthe host system during infection. With flounder as a model, it was\nfound that mutation of eta1 reduces the ability of E. tarda to infect\nhost cells, disseminate into host tissues, and cause mortality of the\ninfected fish. Purified recombinant Eta1 is able to interact with\nflounder lymphocytes, and blocking this interaction inhibits cel-\nlular infection. Consistent with these observations, Eta1 induces\nstrong immunoprotection in flounder when used as a subunit\nvaccine. These results suggest that Eta1 possibly functions as an\nadhesin during E. tarda infection and, as a result, is required for\noptimal bacterial invasion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (31025030), the Ministry of Science and Technology\n(2011AA10A216), the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences (KZCX2-EW-Q213), and the Taishan Scholar Pro-\ngram of Shandong Province.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

We hypothesized\nthat this susceptibility may be associated with a decreased response by leukocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\nIn this study, we compared LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\ufffd) by mononuclear\ncells (MNC) from adult peripheral blood and newborn umbilical cord blood in vitro and attempted to\ndetermine the mechanisms involved in its regulation. At a high concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml) and in the\npresence of autologous plasma, MNC from adults and newborns secreted similar amounts of TNF-\ufffd. However,\nin the absence of plasma, MNC from newborns secreted significantly less TNF-\ufffd compared to MNC from\nadults. Moreover, at a low concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) and in the presence of plasma, TNF-\ufffd secretion\nwas significantly lower for newborn MNC compared to adult MNC. Adults and newborns had similar numbers\nof CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-positive cells as measured by flow cytometry. However, the intensity\nof the CD14 marker was greater for adult than for newborn cells. Incubation of cells with LPS led to an increase\nin CD14 and TLR-4 intensity for adult cells but not for newborn cells. The effect of LPS stimulation of adult\nor newborn cells was similar for ERK, p38, and I\ufffdB\ufffd phosphorylation, as well as I\ufffdB\ufffd degradation. Finally,\nwe assessed levels of the TLR-4 adapter protein, the myeloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88). We found a\ndirect relation between adult and newborn TNF-\ufffd secretion and MyD88, which was significantly decreased in\nnewborn monocytes. Since TLR-4 signals intracellularly through the adapter protein, MyD88, we hypothesize\nthat MyD88-dependent factors are responsible for delayed and decreased TNF-\ufffd secretion in newborn\nmonocytes.\n\nPhagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils\n(PMNs) and monocytes play a key role in host defense against\nbacterial infection. During infection, phagocytic cell activity is\nmodulated by cytokines (from the host) and toxins (from the\ninvading microorganism). For example, after exposure to lipo-\npolysaccharide (LPS), PMNs are primed for increased oxida-\ntive radical production (1, 45), and monocytes are activated to\nproduce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\ufffd) (4, 35). Since\npriming of PMNs and activation of monocytes are key stages of\nthe early response to infection, any altered or delayed response\nto LPS may interupt the host\u2019s response to infection.\n\nWe have shown previously that PMNs from newborns are\nprimed less effectively in vitro with LPS compared to PMNs\nfrom adults (7, 38). Similarly, some authors have found that\nmonocytes from newborns have a lower response than adult\nmonocytes in the secretion of cytokines, such as TNF-\ufffd, after\nLPS stimulation (11, 36). This diminished response to LPS by\nnewborn monocytes and PMNs may contribute to the observed\nincreased incidence and susceptibility of newborns to gram-\nnegative bacterial infection (22, 42).\n\nOver the past decade the mechanism of LPS interaction with\n\nthe phagocytic cell membrane has become more clearly under-\nstood. For adult PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages, CD14 is\nthe principal cell membrane receptor for the LPS/LPS-binding\nprotein (LBP) complex (40). Indeed, the presence of CD14\nand LBP greatly enhance cellular activation with LPS (25, 27,\n37, 41, 48, 50, 51, 54). In addition to CD14, a family of trans-\nmembrane receptors with homology to Toll proteins of Dro-\nsophila are known to trigger inflammatory reactions, including\nsecretion of proinflammatory cytokines (32, 39). The Toll-like\nreceptor-4 (TLR-4) imparts ligand-specific recognition of LPS\nfor mammalian cells (18, 28). Through CD14\u2013TLR-4 interac-\ntions, LPS induces several intracellular responses, including\nactivation of nuclear factor \ufffdB (NF-\ufffdB) and activation of the\nmitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, particularly\nextracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 (49).\nHowever, the intracellular processes involved in TNF-\ufffd tran-\nscription, translation, and secretion into the extracellular space\nafter stimulation by LPS are less well understood.\n\nUsing an in vitro model of the mononuclear cell (MNC)\nresponse to LPS, Cohen et al. (11) showed that cells derived\nfrom cord blood of newborns secrete lower amounts of TNF-\ufffd\ncompared to MNC from adults. A decreased response to LPS\nmay be even more marked in preterm infants (17, 24). How-\never, the mechanism underlying the hyporesponsiveness of\nnewborn cells has not been determined. We hypothesized that\nnewborn cells have an inherent deficiency in the production of\n\n* Corresponding author.

We investigated surface expres-\nsion of CD14 and TLR-4 on adult and newborn monocytes and\nLPS-induced TNF-\ufffd secretion. We also compared intracellular\nfactors in adult and newborn mononuclear cells, including my-\neloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylation\nof ERK-1 and ERK-2 (ERK-1/2) and p38, as well as I\ufffdB phos-\nphorylation and degradation. We report here that diminished\nLPS-induced TNF-\ufffd protein secretion by monocytes from human\nnewborns is associated with diminished MyD88 expression.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nReagents.

Red blood cell lysing solution and paraformaldehyde were pur-\nchased from Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, Calif.) and from Cedarlane\nLaboratories Ltd., respectively. Flat-bottom multiwell plates for the enzyme\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were purchased from Costar (Cambridge,\nMass.). SuperScript II, random hexamers, deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix,\ndithiothreitol, HEPES buffer, sodium bicarbonate solution, and Hanks balanced\nsalt solution were obtained from Gibco-BRL (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).\nRPMI 1640 medium and 32P-labeled dCTP were purchased from ICN Biomedi-\ncals Canada, Ltd. (St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada). An RNeasy kit was obtained\nfrom Qiagen, Inc. (Chatsworth, Calif.). E-Toxate kits, ABTS [2,2\ufffdazinobis(3-\nethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)], and all other chemicals were purchased from\nSigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). Buffers and plasma were checked for\nendotoxin by a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay to ensure that LPS was not\ndetectable (limit of detection of \ufffd12 pg/ml).\n\nAntibodies. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) MY4 (immunoglobulin G\n2b [IgG2b]) directed against CD14, and isotypic control (IgG2b) were purchased\nfrom Coulter Immunology (Hialeah, Fla.). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\nconjugated to rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Serotec (To-\nronto, Ontario, Canada). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), biotin-\nconjugated mouse anti-human TNF-\ufffd (MAb 11 IgG1) and purified mouse anti-\nhuman TNF-\ufffd (MAb 1 and IgG1) were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego,\nCalif.).

Rabbit anti-p38 protein, anti-ERK2 protein, anti-\nMyD88 antibodies, and mouse antiphosphorylated ERK1/2 MAb were pur-\nchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, Calif.). Rabbit anti-\ufffd-actin and\nHRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Sigma Chem-\nical Co. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Anti-human TLR-4 (IgG2a) MAb was a\nkind gift of Kinsuke Miyake (Department of Immunology, Saga Medical School,\nNabeshima, Saga, Japan). Mouse IgG2a isotype control MAb (3H11) was a gift\nof Andrew Issekutz (Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University, Halifax,\nNova Scotia, Canada).\n\nMNC preparation. Fresh peripheral venous blood from healthy adult volun-\nteers and umbilical cord blood from normal, full-term newborns delivered by\ncaesarean section, were collected aseptically and anticoagulated with heparin (10\nU/ml). MNC were isolated by using a Percoll gradient technique described\npreviously (34). MNC were routinely purified to \ufffd95% purity and \ufffd98% via-\nbility in approximately 2 h and were assayed immediately afterward. After en-\nrichment, MNC were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 without serum. In\npreliminary experiments, MNC from adult venous and from newborn cord blood\nwere characterized by using flow cytometry (FACS) for surface CD14. The\npercentage of CD14 positive monocytes in MNC was similar for adult and\nnewborn cells (10 and 12%, respectively).\n\nAdherent cells (monocytes) were prepared by culturing MNC (3.5 \ufffd 106/ml)\nin RPMI 1640 with 5% autologous plasma in the wells of a 24-well plate at 37\u00b0C\nand 5% CO2 for 2 h. The nonadherent cells were removed by a wash with\nmedium without plasma. Adherent cells were stimulated with LPS (at concen-\ntrations indicated in Results) in RPMI 1640 culture medium with or without 5%\nautologous plasma. Supernatants of adherent cells were collected at 1, 3, 6, and\n24 h and stored at \t70\u00b0C until assayed. In some experiments, MNC were also\ncultured and stimulated with LPS in suspension (i.e., nonadherent).\n\nFlow cytometry. For CD14 assessment healthy adult venous or full term new-\nborn cord blood (50 \nl) samples were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1\nor 10 ng of LPS/ml for 30 min at 37\u00b0C before being stained with anti-CD14 (MY4\n\nclone; final concentration, 12.5 \ng/ml) or isotype control antibody (12.5 \ng/ml)\nfor 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks balanced salt\nsolution and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at\n4\u00b0C, and then 1 ml of red blood cell lysing solution was added. The cells were washed\nthen fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\nFor TLR-4 staining, leukocyte-rich plasma was incubated in the presence or\nabsence of 5 ng of LPS/ml for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed twice with PBS\nand labeled with a mouse anti-human TLR-4 (IgG2a) MAb or IgG2a isotype\ncontrol antibody for 1 h and then washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated\ngoat anti-mouse IgG. Red blood cells were then removed by hypotonic washing,\nand the remaining cells were suspended in 1% paraformaldehyde. Cell prepa-\nrations were stored at 4\u00b0C until FACS analysis. Cells were analyzed by using a\nBecton Dickinson FACScan by using the Lysis II software program. Lympho-\ncytes, PMNs, and monocytes were identified on the basis of front and side light\nscatter. Specific CD14 and TLR-4 was expressed as the mean value of the\nfluorescence intensity on samples minus that of the isotype control.\n\nMeasurements of adult and newborn TNF-\ufffd. Bioactivity of TNF-\ufffd was as-\nsessed with L929 cells as described previously (19). TNF-\ufffd protein concentra-\ntions were measured by using an ELISA as described by the manufacturer\n(Pharmingen) by using MAb 1 (2 \ng/ml) as capture and biotin-conjugated MAb\n11 for detection. TNF-\ufffd standards and adult and newborn MNC supernatants\nwere diluted in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. The lower limit of detection\nwas 15 pg/ml in the assay. For intracellular TNF-\ufffd, standards were diluted in lysis\nbuffer. The lower limit of detection with lysis buffer was 30 pg/106 cells.\n\nMeasurements of adult and neonate mRNA for TNF-\ufffd. Isolation of total adult\nand newborn cellular RNA was achieved by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. One microgram each of adult and\nnewborn MNC RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by using Superscript II\nreverse transcriptase in the presence of [\ufffd-32P]dCTP. Then, equal amounts of\nacid-precipitable counts per minute of each cDNA were used for PCR. PCR was\nrun for 35 cycles for \ufffd-actin detection and 40 or 45 cycles for TNF-\ufffd detection\nin the presence of specific primer. The sequences for the sense and antisense\nprimers for TNF-\ufffd are 5\ufffd-TTG TTC CTC AGC CTC TTC TCC-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-AGG\nGTT TGC TAC AAC ATG GGC-3\ufffd, respectively, and the sense and antisense\nprimer for \ufffd-actin are 5\ufffd-ACA TCC GCA AAG ACC TGT ACG-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-TTG\nCTG ATC CAC ATC TGC TGG-3\ufffd, respectively. The antisense primer for\nTNF-\ufffd spans an intron-exon boundary and thus cannot amplify a product from\nDNA. Neither TNF-\ufffd primer cross-reacts with human TNF-\ufffd. PCR products\nwere electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.5 \ng of ethidium\nbromide/ml and photographed under UV light.\n\nWestern blot assays. Adherent monocytes from adults and newborns were\nprepared and incubated in the absence or presence of LPS (0.1 or 10 ng/ml) as\ndescribed above for 20 min at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. After the incubation, the\nmedium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS con-\ntaining 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The PBS was then replaced with 0.5\nml of M2 buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.0], 0.5% NP-40, 250 mM NaC1, 3 mM EGTA,\n3 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 \ng of\nleupeptin/ml, 5 \ng/ml of pepstatin A, 10 \ng of aprotinin/ml, 0.1 mM Na3VO4).\nAfter incubation for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the lysates were transferred to microcentri-\nfuge tubes and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 \ufffd g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to\nremove insoluble materials. The protein concentrations in the lysates were de-\ntermined by using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. Twenty micrograms of\nprotein from each sample was analyzed by Western blotting after sodium dodecyl\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer, with antibodies\nspecific for phosphorylated I\ufffdB\ufffd, I\ufffdB\ufffd protein, MyD88, TLR-4, phosphorylated\np38, or ERK1/2. The binding of the antibodies were detected with HRP-conju-\ngated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG and ECL Western blotting reagents, fol-\nlowed by exposure to Kodak X-ray films. The equality of loading was confirmed\nby stripping the membranes and reblotting with p38, ERK2 protein antibodies as\ndescribed earlier (6). Band density was quantified by densitometry analysis by\nusing NIH Image J software and calculated as the corrected density of MyD88\nbands related to that of \ufffd-actin on the same blots.\n\nStatistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean \ufffd the standard deviation\n(SD) (see Fig. 1, 3, and 5) or the mean \ufffd standard error of mean (SEM) (see Fig.\n2). For comparison between adult and newborn samples, a nonpaired t test was\nused; a P value of \ufffd0.05 was considered significant. Statistical determinations\nwere done by using Statistix (Analytical Software, Minneapolis, Minn.).\n\nRESULTS\n\nTNF-\ufffd secretion by adult and newborn MNC.

In agreement with\nearlier reports that newborn monocytes secret fewer cytokines\nthan adult monocytes upon LPS stimulation (11, 36), in our\nexperimental system, we also observed that the secretion of\nTNF-\ufffd from both adherent monocytes and nonadherent MNC\nof newborns was less than that from adults early in incubation\n(\ufffd6 h) (Fig. 1). For adult cells the concentration of TNF-\ufffd in\nthe supernatant of adherent monocytes peaked between 3 and\n6 h, whereas the maximum for newborn cells was not reached\nuntil 6 h of incubation. Excellent correlation between bioassay\n\nand ELISA was found for cells from adults and newborns (Fig.\n1A and B) (r \ufffd 0.94).\n\nSince adherence of monocytes to glass or plastic may signal\ncells to produce inflammatory cytokines (26) and to develop\ncharacteristics of tissue macrophages, we undertook experi-\nments with nonadherent MNC in the presence or absence of\nplasma. Using this model we compared LPS-induced TNF-\ufffd\nproduction by adult venous and newborn cord blood MNC. As\nshown in Fig. 1C, neither adult nor newborn MNC secreted\ndetectable TNF-\ufffd protein (\ufffd15 pg/ml) after stimulation with a\nlow concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) in the absence of plasma.\nIn the presence of plasma (5%), however, this low concentra-\ntion of LPS did induce both adult and newborn MNC TNF-\ufffd\nsecretion. Levels achieved by adult MNC were significantly\nhigher than that of newborn cells at 3 h (5.38 \ufffd 0.56 ng/ml\nversus 0.97 \ufffd 0.85 ng/ml; P \ufffd 0.01). The difference between\nadult and newborn cellular response was still seen after 6 h of\nincubation (6.60 \ufffd 0.97 ng/ml versus 1.52 \ufffd 1.30 ng/ml; P \ufffd\n0.05).\n\nIn the absence of plasma and at a higher LPS concentration\n(10 ng/ml), both adult and newborn MNC produced TNF-\ufffd\n(Fig. 1C), but MNC from newborns again secreted less TNF-\ufffd\ncompared to adult MNC (0.72 \ufffd 0.33 ng/ml versus 2.05 \ufffd 0.72\nng/ml; P \ufffd 0.05). As expected, when 5% plasma was present,\nMNC from both adults and newborns secreted higher amounts\nof TNF-\ufffd. Under these conditions (10 ng of LPS/ml plus 5%\nplasma) adult and newborn MNC secreted similar amounts of\nTNF-\ufffd (5.80 \ufffd 1.01 ng/ml for adult and 5.65 \ufffd 0.57 ng/ml for\nnewborn MNC).\n\nIn order to better understand TNF-\ufffd regulation in new-\nborns, we examined the levels of mRNA for TNF-\ufffd in stimu-\nlated MNC. Newborn and adult MNC consistently showed\ndetectable mRNA for TNF-\ufffd in the presence of 0.1 ng of\nLPS/ml alone, although we failed to detect secreted or intra-\ncellular TNF-\ufffd protein under this condition. When plasma and\nLPS (0.1 ng/ml) were both present in the cultures, steady-state\nmRNA levels slightly increased but remained similar in both\nadult and newborn cells (Fig. 2). Thus, differences in TNF-\ufffd\nexpression could not be attributed to major differences in\nTNF-\ufffd mRNA levels between adults and newborns.\n\nCD14 and TLR-4 of adult and newborn monocytes. Since\nmembrane-bound CD14 and TLR-4 is required for effective\nLPS induced TNF-\ufffd production from monocytes/macro-\nphages, we characterized CD14 on monocytes from adults and\n\nFIG. 1.

As shown in Fig. 3,\nadult and newborn monocytes expressed similar levels of\nTLR-4 and CD14 before LPS stimulation; however, newborn\ncells demonstrated significantly lower levels of both TLR-4 and\nCD14 than adult cells after LPS stimulation (Fig. 3).\n\nResponses of MAP kinases and I\ufffdB\ufffd in monocytes from\nadults and newborns to LPS stimulation. The inducible ex-\npression of the gene for TNF-\ufffd by monocytes is regulated by\nMAP kinases and I\ufffdB/NF-\ufffdB nuclear transcription factors (14,\n49). Because the LPS-induced secretion of TNF-\ufffd from new-\nborn MNC was remarkably decreased compared to adult cells,\nwe assessed the signaling molecule activation in adult and\nnewborn monocytes after LPS stimulation. The basal levels of\n\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in newborn monocytes\nwere slightly higher than in adult monocytes (Fig. 4A and C).\nAfter LPS stimulation, incremental changes in levels of phos-\nphorylated ERK1/2 were somewhat greater in adult than new-\nborn monocytes (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, LPS activated\np38 to a similar extent in monocytes from both adults and\nnewborns (Fig. 4C). Similar results were observed in MNC that\nwere incubated in suspension (Fig. 5). These patterns of MAP\nkinase responsiveness suggest that MAP kinase signaling, by\nitself, was unlikely to be responsible for the attenuation of\nnewborn TNF-\ufffd production.\n\nA critical step during induction of many cytokines is the\nactivation of NF-\ufffdB. This occurs as a result of phosphorylation\n\nFIG. 3. LPS-stimulated newborn monocytes have lower amounts of\nTLR-4 and CD14 than adult cells.

As shown in\nFig. 4E and F, I\ufffdB\ufffd phosphorylation and I\ufffdB\ufffd protein deg-\nradation were similar for both adult and newborn monocytes.\nThese data correspond with the reverse transcription-PCR re-\nsults showing similar levels of TNF-\ufffd mRNA in adult and\nnewborn cells (Fig. 2).\n\nExpression of MyD88 in monocytes from adults and new-\nborns. MyD88, a cytosolic adapter protein, has been reported\nas an essential mediator for LPS receptor signaling (3, 21, 43,\n46). Thus, we investigated whether there was any difference in\nthe expression of MyD88 in adult versus newborn monocytes\nby using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, there was a\nmarked difference in protein levels of MyD88 in lysates pre-\npared from newborn compared to adult monocytes (58.7% \ufffd\n9.8% of adult monocyte MyD88 protein; P \ufffd 0.0003 as deter-\nmined by paired t test). This was not linked to any detectable\ndifference in total cellular TLR-4 protein on the same analyzed\nsamples (Fig. 6), although the surface expression of this recep-\ntor was higher in LPS-stimulated adult cells compared to new-\nborn cells (Fig. 3A).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt is generally understood that newborns have increased\nsusceptibility to gram-negative bacterial and viral infection. A\nnumber of mechanisms may contribute to this, including hu-\nmoral and cellular factors. In recent years cytokines critical in\nthe early stages of inflammation, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n\n(36) and IL-12 (20, 31), have also been assessed in newborns.\nMost of this work was done with primary cell cultures stimu-\nlated in vitro with live organisms or bacterial LPS. Diminished\nand delayed secretion of these cytokines has been reported for\nnewborn cells.\n\nThe results of studies comparing TNF-\ufffd secretion by new-\nborn animals or cells after stimulation with LPS or bacteria\nhave been variable. Although most studies have reported di-\nminished responsiveness of newborns (9, 11, 36), some inves-\ntigations have found similar or increased responsiveness of\nnewborns compared to juvenile or adult animals after LPS\nstimulation (13).\n\nIn our study, significantly lower amounts of TNF-\ufffd were\nsecreted by human newborn MNC compared to adult MNC\nafter LPS exposure. This was evident when cells were stimu-\nlated with a high concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml) in the ab-\nsence of plasma and at a low concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml)\nin the presence of plasma.\n\nDiminished TNF-\ufffd secretion correlated directly with levels\nof MyD88 in newborn cells. Our findings with MNC and our\nprevious report with PMNs from normal newborns (38) are\nremarkably similar to observations with cells from MyD88\t/\t\n\nmice and MyD88 truncated cells. Mice with the MyD88 gene\ninactivated (MyD88\t/\t) lack LPS-induced cytokine produc-\ntion and NO2\n\n\t release but preserve NF-\ufffdB and JNK activation\n(2, 21, 23). TLR signaling is also suppressed when MyD88\nmolecule is truncated (10). The diminished LPS responses that\nwe observed in newborn MNC are therefore consistent with\n\nFIG. 6. Expression of MyD88 and TLR-4 in adult and newborn monocytes. (A) Adherent monocytes were harvested and lysed as described in\nthe text. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-MyD88 antibody. (B and C) The same membranes were stripped and\nreblotted with a rabbit anti-TLR-4 antibody (B) and then repeatedly with the stripping-reblotting cycle for \ufffd-actin (C). A pooled result of the\ndensitometry analysis of MyD88 bands in panel A is shown in panel D as means \ufffd the SD of arbitrary units normalized by the density of \ufffd-actin\nbands (n \ufffd 7). \u274b, P \ufffd 0.0003 (paired t test).\n\nVOL. 72, 2004 TNF-\ufffd PRODUCTION BY NEWBORN MONONUCLEAR CELLS 1227\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\n\n\nreports of decreased expression of MyD88. Because of its cen-\ntral place in signaling pathways, MyD88 may become a \u201cbot-\ntleneck\u201d affecting TLR-triggered cytokines in general (44).\nThis possibility should be explored through assessment of\nother stimuli linked to MyD88 processing and other cytokines.\n\nThe differences between newborn and adult TNF-\ufffd secre-\ntion are most evident in suboptimal conditions of stimulation,\nsuch as low concentrations of LPS in the presence of plasma or\nhigher concentrations of LPS in the absence of plasma. How-\never, with high concentrations of LPS in the presence of\nplasma, newborn and adult MNC secrete similar amounts of\nTNF-\ufffd. The reason for this difference is currently not clear.\nWe hypothesize that, at high concentrations, LPS may over-\nwhelm deficits of MyD88 by signaling through a MyD88-inde-\npendent pathway, resulting in similar amounts of TNF-\ufffd se-\ncretion in adult and newborn MNC.\n\nProduction and secretion of TNF-\ufffd may be controlled or\nmodulated at several steps: cell receptors, intracellular mes-\nsengers, mRNA transcription, protein translation, intracellular\nstorage, and/or secretion. In addition, LPS can interact with\ncells via at least two pathways that are either dependent or\nindependent of plasma proteins (5, 11, 12, 30, 47, 52, 53). The\ntwo pathways of LPS activation may serve different roles in\ngram-negative bacterial infection. Plasma-dependent LPS ac-\ntivation may be the predominant pathway for monocytes and\nPMNs in the bloodstream, where plasma proteins are at high\nconcentrations and LPS levels are low early in sepsis. In con-\ntrast, the plasma-independent pathway may be important at\nthe local site of infection, where plasma proteins levels are low\nand the LPS concentration may be high. Understanding both\npathways of cellular activation by LPS will be important in\norder to understand the host response to gram-negative infec-\ntion.\n\nAt low concentrations of LPS, LBP facilitates the binding of\nLPS to CD14 and greatly enhances TNF-\ufffd secretion. Thus,\none possible explanation for our finding is that LBP or some\nother constituents of plasma may be more active in adult than\nin newborn plasma. However, LBP is unlikely to be responsi-\nble, since we have shown previously that concentrations in\nnewborn and adult plasma are similar (8). We also speculated\nthat the difference between adult and newborn MNC protein\nproduction might be related to mRNA transcription. However,\nwhen mRNA for TNF-\ufffd was assessed, no striking difference\nwas observed. This observation is consistent with the report of\nHan et al. (16) showing that TNF-\ufffd secretion after LPS stim-\nulation is controlled primarily by posttranscriptional mecha-\nnisms.\n\nCD14 is a critical LPS receptor on human MNC. Most LPS\nresponses including activation of MAP kinases depend primar-\nily on CD14 (15, 29). Because CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidy-\nlinositol-anchoring molecule, it lacks an intracellular domain\nneeded to transmit the LPS signal. As presently understood,\nLPS, with the extracellular proteins LBP and MD2, binds to\nCD14, which then clusters with TLR-4. The CD14\u2013TLR-4\ncomplex then signals intracellularly through the adapter pro-\nteins MyD88 and/or Mal (MyD88 adapter-like protein) to in-\nduce activation of IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase),\nwhich triggers signal cascades through MAP kinase and other\npathways (3, 21, 33, 43, 46). We found that TLR-4 expression\nin the monocytes of adults and newborns is similar before cells\n\nare stimulated with LPS. The MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38\nwere phosphorylated in both adult and newborn monocytes in\nresponse to LPS. However, more studies should be done on\nMAP kinases to determine whether subtle differences between\nadults and newborns are present. The LPS induced I\ufffdB\ufffd phos-\nphorylation and degradation were also similar in adult and\nnewborn monocytes.\n\nThe finding of greatly diminished MyD88 in cells of human\nnewborns provides some insight into the role this molecule\nmay play in the diminished inflammatory responses in new-\nborns. Although the suppression of inflammation and acquired\nimmunity may be advantageous for survival of the fetus, innate\nand acquired immune processes must be acquired rapidly after\nbirth. Further study on regulation of MyD88 should be done to\nprovide insight into the ontogeny of the innate immune system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Chris Waterhouse and Linda Best for their technical\nassistance, Kim Barrett for transcribing the manuscript, and the Case\nRoom nurses of the IWK Health Centre for their assistance in collect-\ning newborn umbilical cord blood.\n\nThis research was supported by Hospital for Sick Children Founda-\ntion (Toronto) and the Canada Institute of Health Research\n(MT14439).

This critical role of OCT4 is maintained in\n\nembryonic stem cells [7\u201310], the developing germline [11\u201313],\n\nand germline tumors, such as seminomas and embryonic\n\nteratocarcinomas [14\u201318]. When inducing pluripotency in differ-\n\nentiated cells, OCT4 appears to be an essential, but not the only\n\nrequired transcription factor [19,20]. OCT4 acts as a transcrip-\n\ntional activator of genes involved in maintenance of undifferen-\n\ntiated state and as a repressor of differentiation-specific genes\n\n[7,21,22].\n\nIn addition to its presence in embryonic and germ-derived cells,\n\nexpression of OCT4 and other pluripotency markers has been\n\nreported in cancers, adult stem cells and various adult somatic\n\ntissues. The most abundant reports about OCT4 expression can\n\nbe found for hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells\n\nfrom umbilical cord blood and bone marrow [23\u201328]. Detection\n\nof OCT4 transcripts in these compartments has led to a suggestion\n\nthat embryonic OCT4A may participate in maintenance of\n\nstemness in adult stem cell compartments [29], somatic tissue\n\ncancers (bladder [30], squamous cell carcinoma [31], breast\n\ncarcinoma [32,33] and may even be expressed in normal\n\ndifferentiated tissues [34,35]. Most astoundingly, existence of true\n\npluripotent embryonic stem-like cells in adult organs has been\n\nproposed [23\u201325,36,37]. We have described expression of OCT4\n\nin adult human fibroblasts undergoing induction into a regener-\n\nation competent cell type (iRC) using low oxygen culture and\n\nmedium supplementation with FGF2 [35,38,39]. iRC cells display\n\nincreased life span, maintain normal karyotype, express a number\n\nof stem cell genes, participate in in vivo regeneration of skeletal\n\nmuscle, but do not form tumors [39]. While we observed that the\n\namount of OCT4 transcript does not change before and after\n\ninduction, we at the time did not examine whether the transcript\n\nbelonged to the OCT4A or its pseudogenes.\n\nThe POU5F1 gene produces three transcripts by alternative\n\nsplicing [40,41] and three protein isoforms by alternative codon\n\nuse [42] (Figure 1). Only the OCT4A transcript contains the first\n\nexon at its 59 sequence and only protein translated from this\n\ntranscript consequently contains the unique N-terminal transacti-\n\nvation domain that regulates DNA binding of OCT4A to target\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\npromoters. It is only this full length OCT4A - a 360 amino acid\n\nprotein - that localizes to the nucleus, binds to OCT4-regulated\n\npromoters, and contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency\n\nand self-renewal [43]. OCT4A transcript and protein can be\n\ndistinguished from the non-pluripotency variants (OCT4B) using\n\nprimers specific for 59 sequence of OCT4A mRNA and N-\n\nterminal-recognizing antibodies, respectively, as well as by their\n\ndistinct subcellular localization [41,42,44,45].\n\nWith a more recent description of OCT4 pseudogenes and their\n\nexpression [46\u201348], however, studies examining OCT4 expression\n\nhave to consider an additional level of complexity (Table S1,\n\nFigure S1). Eight OCT4 pseudogenes have been identified using\n\nbioinformatics approach [47] and several of these are expressed\n\nand translated into proteins in somatic tumors, but not in\n\nembryonic carcinomas, fibroblasts or normal tissues [48\u201351].\n\nAmong the OCT4 pseudogenes, OCT4-pg1, OCT4-pg3 and\n\nOCT4-pg4 pseudogenes share a high sequence homology to\n\nOCT4A and share the unique N-terminal coding sequence.\n\nSimilarly, cell types isolated from umbilical cord or adult bone\n\nmarrow express OCT4-pg3, OCT4-pg4, and OCT4-pg5 but do\n\nnot express embryonic OCT4A [52], and reports identifying these\n\ntranscripts as OCT4A may have been erroneous. The only adult,\n\nnon-cancer cell type that has been reported to express pseudo-\n\ngenes are cells derived from peripheral blood [36]. It has been\n\nsuggested that pseudogenes may play regulatory roles in expres-\n\nsion of genes from which they originate, potentially by an RNA\n\ninterference-like mechanisms [53,54] or even as weak transcrip-\n\ntional activators [48].\n\nWhen studying expression of OCT4 it is therefore critically\n\nimportant to account for OCT4 transcripts, OCT4 pseudogene\n\ntranscripts and all the possible protein products, the majority of\n\nwhich have no demonstrated DNA-binding activity. While\n\nmethods and reagents to distinguish between OCT4A and\n\nOCT4B transcripts and protein variants are available, unavail-\n\nability of similar reagents to distinguish between embryonic\n\nOCT4A and its pseudogene transcripts and proteins remains an\n\nobstacle to studying activity of these genes in more detail. Here we\n\ndescribe unique endonuclease restriction sites within OCT4A and\n\nits pseudogenes that enable differentiation between their tran-\n\nscripts, and investigate their expression in undifferentiated and\n\ndifferentiated human cells.\n\nWe demonstrate that embryonic stem cells express exclusively\n\nOCT4A and that during differentiation this expression ceases and\n\nis replaced by expression of pseudogenes. Similar regulation,\n\nhowever faster, takes place in teratocarcinoma cells. We also show\n\nthat all differentiated cell types express exclusively pseudogenes,\n\nbut this expression can shift to predominantly embryonic OCT4 in\n\nadult human fibroblasts undergoing induction of regenerative\n\ncompetence (iRC) by FGF2 and low oxygen.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell Culture\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESCs, WA09) and induced\n\npluripotent stem cells (iPSCs, DF19-9-7T) were obtained,\n\ncultured, and maintained as recommended by the supplier\n\n(WiCell). For differentiation into embryonic bodies (EBs), stem\n\ncells were either trypsinized (hESCs) or mechanically dissociated\n\n(iPSCs) and plated onto low attachment culture plates in\n\ndifferentiation medium consisting of DMEM-F12, 7.5% serum\n\nreplacement, 10% FBS, 0.56NEAA (Gibco), 0.005% b-mercap-\ntoethanol (Gibco), and 2 mmol of retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium\nwas changed with fresh medium twice a week. On day 5 of\n\ndifferentiation, EBs were transferred to cell culture plates where\n\nFigure 1.

NTERA, NCCIT (both\n\nteratocarcinoma), HeLa, and NHSY (glioblastoma) cells were\n\nobtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC).\n\nFor differentiation, NTERA cells were seeded at density 16106\n\ncells per 75 cm2 in expansion medium (DMEM +10% FBS). After\nattachment the medium was changed to differentiation medium\n\nconsisting of DMEM +10% FBS supplemented with 0.01 mM\ntrans-retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium was changed twice a week\n\nand samples for RNA isolation taken during 21 days post-\n\ndifferentiation.\n\nOther cell types or their total RNA was obtained from Lonza\n\n(human mesenchymal stem cells \u2013 hMSCs, human umbilical cord\n\nvascular endothelium - HUVEC), Clontech (testis RNA), Lonza\n\n(smooth muscle cells, and Clontech (RNA from heart). All cell\n\ntypes were cultures as recommended by suppliers. Control adult\n\nprimary human fibroblasts CRL-2352 (ATCC) were cultured in\n\nDMEM-F12, 10% FBS at ambient oxygen, or in 2% oxygen in the\n\nsame medium, supplemented with 4 ng/mL of FGF2 (Pepro-\n\nTech).\n\nTotal RNA Extraction and RT-PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen).\n\nRNA integrity was examined on 1% agarose gel. 1 mg of total\nRNA was reverse transcribed using QuantiTech Reverse Tran-\n\nscription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nTotal RNA was first treated with DNA Wipeout buffer to remove\n\npotential contamination of genomic DNA and then used for\n\nreverse transcription. The cDNA samples were stored at 220uC.\nThe polymerase chain reaction contained 26 GoTaq Green\nMastermix (Promega), 20 pmols of primers and PCR water. The\n\nPCR primers used for PCR were: NANOG F: 59-\n\nTGTCTTCTGCTGAGATGCCTCACA-39 and R: 59-\n\nCCTTCTGCGTCACACCATTGCTAT-39; CRIPTO1 F: 59-\n\nGACGAGCAAATTCCTGATGG-39 and R: 59-\n\nGCCTCTTTTCCCCCTAATTG-39; GAPDH F: 59-ATCAC-\n\nCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-39 and R: 59-\n\nTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACG-39; OCT4 F, 59-\n\nGTTGATCCTCGGACCTGGCTA-39; R, 59-\n\nGGTTGCCTCTCACTCGGTTCT-39. The OCT4 primers\n\nwere designed to bind at nucleotides 142\u2013162 and 768\u2013788 of\n\nthe coding OCT4 sequence and amplify OCT4 as well as\n\npseudogene 1, 3 and 4 transcripts (Figure 1). PCR cycling\n\nparameters consisted of an initial cDNA denaturation of 2 min at\n\n95uC, followed by 15 sec at 94uC, 30 sec at annealing temperature\n60uC, and DNA extension for 1 min at 72uC for 31 cycles. A final\nextension step was performed at 72uC for 10 min and held at 4uC\nuntil analysis. All PCR reactions included no template controls or\n\nno RT reaction. PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel\n\nelectrophoresis and were visualized by exposure to 535 nm light\n\non Kodak MM4000 image analyzer.\n\nPCR Clean-up\nFour 25 microliter reactions were combined and PCR product\n\ncleaned using NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). Briefly,\n\nPCR reactions were diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer NT and\n\nloaded on NucleoSpin Extract II column and centrifuged 1 min at\n\n11,0006g. Flow-through was discarded and column washed with\n700 mL of buffer NT3 and then the membrane was dried for\n2 min at 11,0006g. DNA was eluted into a new 1.5 mL tube and\nDNA concentration was determined with Nanodrop.\n\nRestriction Digest\nSequence alignments between OCT4A and OCT4-pg1,\n\nOCT4-pg3 and OCT4-pg4 were used to identify restriction sites\n\nthat were then used for differentiation between the transcripts\n\n(Figure 2). A previously described ApaI restriction site specific for\n\nembryonic OCT4A [55] and three novel restriction sites for\n\npseudogenes were selected (HinfI for OCT4-pg1; BglI for OCT4-\n\npg3, XhoI for OCT4-pg4; all from NEBiolabs). 500 ng of PCR\n\namplicons were digested with 12.5U ApaI, 10U XhoI, 10U BglI,\n\nor 10U HinfI. ApaI digestion reaction was incubated for 1.5 h at\n\nroom temperature and the other three for 1.5 h at 37uC. Digested\nproducts were separated on 2% agarose gel with ethidium\n\nbromide and visualized by exposure to 535 nm light on a Kodak\n\nMM4000 image analyzer.\n\nCloning and Sequencing\nPCR amplicons were cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (TOPO\n\nTA Cloning Kit for Sequencing, Invitrogen), were transformed\n\ninto TOPO10 competent E. coli, and were then plated onto LB-\n\nagar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Antibiotic resistant\ncolonies were selected, expanded, and plasmid was isolated, and\n\nbi-directionally sequenced from both T3 and T7 promoters\n\n(Genewiz). Three clones were sequenced for OCT4A from ESCs,\n\n3 clones for each pseudogene from control fibroblasts and 6 clones\n\nfor OCT4A from treated fibroblasts.\n\nWestern Blotting\nTotal cell lysates were prepared using common procedures.\n\nNuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as follows: cells\n\nwere collected using 0.05% trypsin (Cellgro) and washed twice\n\nwith PBS and pelleted. Buffer A (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES\n\npH8.0, 500 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine,\n\n0.15 mM spermine, 0.2% Triton X-100, 7 mM 2-mercaptoeth-\n\nanol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail\n\n(Roche) was used to isolate cytoplasmic fractions. The cell pellets\n\nwere then washed with buffer B (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES\n\npH8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine,\n\n0.15 mM spermine, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented\n\nwith complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Buffer C\n\n(350 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mM\n\nEDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 7 mM 2-\n\nmercaptoethanol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor\n\ncocktail (Roche) was used to isolate nuclear extracts. Protein\n\nconcentration was quantified using Bradford Protein Assay Kit\n\n(Thermo Scientific). Lysates, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions\n\nwere separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF\n\nmembrane using Towbin\u2019s transfer buffer. Membranes were\n\nblocked with 5% dry milk and 5% FBS in TTBS and incubated\n\nwith primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Primary anti-\n\nhuman OCT4 antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal ab19857\n\nderived against the C-terminus of human OCT4, rabbit polyclonal\n\nab18976 derived against amino acids 1\u201314 (both from Abcam);\n\nand mouse monoclonal sc-5279 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)\n\ndeveloped against the N-terminus. The anti-a-tubulin antibody\n(Sigma) was used as a loading control. Appropriate secondary\n\nHRP-conjugated antibodies were used and signal detected by\n\nenhanced chemilluminescence (Amersham, BioRad) on Kodak\n\nMM4000.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nThe same three anti-OCT4 antibodies were used for ICC: sc-\n\n5279 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ab19857, and ab18976 (both\n\nfrom Abcam). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-\n\nmouse AlexaFluor568 and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor568.

As expected, strong\n\nexpression of all three stem cell genes was maintained during\n\nhESC (Figure 3A) and iPSC maintenance culture (data not\n\nshown). Starting 10 days after induction of differentiation, the\n\nexpression of these embryonic markers gradually decreased and\n\nwas undetectable for CRIPTO1 on day 14 and NANOG on day\n\n17. Low levels of OCT4 transcript, however persisted and were\n\nstill detectable on day 21 (Figure 3B). Expression of the same genes\n\nin control adult human fibroblasts resembled the expression of\n\nthese genes in day 21 differentiated hESCs. We next examined\n\nwhether expression of these genes can be detected in adult human\n\nfibroblasts cultured in 2% oxygen culture in the presence of FGF2.\n\nRT-PCR amplified transcripts could be detected for all three\n\ngenes after 3 days and increased on day 7 (Figure 3C), confirming\n\nour previously published observations [37].\n\nIn addition to recognizing the OCT4A, our OCT4 primers\n\nwere designed to amplify a fragment including 59 region which is\n\ncommon for OCT4A and pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, but which is\n\nmissing in all other pseudogene transcripts and OCT4B transcripts\n\n(Figure 1). The expected 646 bp amplicon, therefore could contain\n\nany of the four transcripts. This allowed us to examine the OCT4\n\namplicon in these cells in more detail. To identify the composition\n\nof the transcripts that could contribute to the 646 bp OCT4\n\namplicon at any time and to distinguish between the individual\n\ntranscripts, we searched otherwise highly homologous sequences of\n\nOCT4 and OCT4-pg1, 3 and 4 for potentially unique endonu-\n\nclease restriction sites. In addition to previously described ApaI\n\nsite, that is specific only for OCT4A [55], we were able to identify\n\nthree restriction sites that were then selected for differentiation\n\nbetween pseudogene transcripts (Figure 2). Restriction analysis of\n\nthe amplicon from hESCs during differentiation is presented in\n\nFigure 3D. ApaI restriction analysis of the 646 bp PCR product\n\nidentified the persistence of OCT4A until day 14 of differentiation,\n\nas evident by ApaI restriction of the amplicon into 146 and 500 bp\n\nfragments. By day 17 the amplicon could not be digested by ApaI\n\nany longer. This indicated that the embryonic OCT4A transcript\n\nwas no longer present and the entire 646 bp amplicon on day 17\n\nand after consisted of pseudogene transcripts. Digestion of the\n\namplicon with XhoI, which digests all but the OCT4-pg4\n\nindicated very low amounts of this transcript in hESCs and\n\nstarted gradually increasing between days 10 and 14 after\n\ndifferentiation. Digestion with BglI which cuts only OCT4-pg3\n\n(412 and 232 bp fragments) revealed a gradual increase of this\n\ntranscript 14 days after differentiation. Lastly, digestion with HinfI\n\nwhich cuts all transcripts into 5 fragments except OCT4-pg1 (4\n\nfragments) similarly indicated the start of OCT4-pg1 transcription\n\non day 14 by the virtue of the longer, 424 bp fragment unique to\n\nOCT4-pg1. Overall, the amount of all pseudogene transcripts\n\nincreased with a concomitant decease in transcription of OCT4A\n\nover the 21 days of hESC differentiation. The pattern of OCT4A\n\nand pseudogenes expression in control fibroblasts resembled the\n\npattern observed in differentiated hESCs and control fibroblasts,\n\nwhich expressed only OCT4 pseudogenes (Figure 3E). However,\n\nApaI digestion of the OCT4 amplicon from fibroblasts grown in\n\n2% oxygen and with 4 ng/ml FGF2\u2013 the conditions we have\n\npreviously used to induce a phenotype switch to a regeneration\n\ncompetent cell [38] - identified embryonic OCT4A transcript at\n\nboth day 3 and day 7 of culture in these conditions, indicating a\n\nreversal of expression from OCT4 pseudogenes to embryonic\n\nOCT4A (Figure 3G), resembling the pattern of ApaI digestion in\n\nhESC and iPSCs (Figure 3D and 3F). When a variety of other cell\n\ntypes were examined, only hESCs and teratocarcinoma cell lines\n\n(NTERA and NCCIT) expressed ApaI-sensitive OCT4A tran-\n\nscript (Figure 3H). Similar downregulation of OCT4A transcript\n\nwas observed during differentiation of teratocarcinoma cells\n\n(Figure 4), however, simultaneous expression of pseudogenes\n\nstarted increasing much earlier during differentiation, and could\n\nbe observed from day 5 onward.\n\nTo confirm our restriction digestion results, the 646 bp PCR\n\namplicons from hESCs, 2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts and\n\ncontrol fibroblasts were cloned into TOPO vector and three clones\n\nfrom each sample for each pseudogene and six clones from\n\n2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts were sequenced. Sequencing\n\nconfirmed our restriction data; hESCs and 2%O2/FGF2 treated\n\nfibroblasts expressed only embryonic OCT4A, while control\n\nfibroblasts expressed OCT4-pg1, pg3 and pg4 (Tables S2\u2013S7).\n\nTranslation and Localization of Protein Products of OCT4\nGene and its Pseudogenes\nTo determine whether any of the OCT4 transcripts were, in\n\nfact, translated into detectable proteins, Western blotting was\n\nperformed. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, the OCT4 sc-5279\n\nantibody, directed against N-terminal protein sequence, recog-\n\nnized several bands in teratocarcinoma cells (NCCIT) and in\n\nfibroblasts, regardless of culture conditions. The doublet that\n\nmigrated at 45/43 kDa (OCT4A or OCT4pg1) and a band\n\nmigrating around 37 kDa (likely somatic OCT4B) were present in\n\nall samples, while the two faster migrating proteins (30 and\n\n20 kDa) were present only in fibroblasts gown in ambient oxygen,\n\nregardless off FGF2 supplementation. The proteins were detected\n\nin both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of fibroblasts. Knowing\n\nthat FGF2/2%O2 fibroblasts express OCT4A, however, it is\n\nreasonable to assume that some of the slower migrating doublet\n\nrepresents embryonic OCT4A. In control fibroblasts these bands\n\nare likely contributed by pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, as the antibody\n\nshould recognize sequences in the N-terminal of these proteins\n\n(Figure 5A). The second antibody, ab19857 (against C-terminal),\n\nsimilarly recognized the doublet of 45/43 kDa and a protein\n\nmigrating around 37 kDa, but failed to recognize any other\n\nprotein products. The amount of detected protein at 37 kDa was\n\nsignificantly higher in cells grown in low oxygen and potentiated\n\nby addition of FGF2 (Figure 5B). The third antibody ab18976,\n\nderived against the N-terminal OCT4 sequence could, in principle\n\ndetect OCT4A and pseudogenes 1 and 3. Intensity of the band in\n\ntreated fibroblast was significantly lower than in hESCs\n\n(Figure 5C). A 31 kDa band was detected in both control and\n\ntreated fibroblasts and could represent OCT4pg4. The identity of\n\nthe 26 kDa band detected with this antibody remains unknown.\n\nAn additional 19 kDa protein, that could be the product pf\n\nOCT4pg3, was recognized in control fibroblasts, but was absent in\n\nstem cells and treated fibroblasts.\n\nImmunocytochemistry revealed OCT4 presence in cell nuclei of\n\nhESCs regardless of the antibody used, as expected (Figure 6). The\n\nN-terminal specific antibody sc-5279 recognized weak nuclear\n\nsignal in 2%O2/FGF2 fibroblasts. The C-terminal ab19857\n\nrecognized nuclear localized protein in hESCs, and nuclear and\n\ncytoplasmic proteins in control and treated fibroblasts. As none of\n\nthe OCT4B variants localize to the nucleus, the nuclear signal can\n\nExpression of OCT4 and Its Pseudogenes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546\n\n\n\nbe contributed only by OCT4A or pseudogene OCT4-pg1\n\nderived protein [48,51]. Considering the individual cell type\n\ntranscript profile, it is possible that in treated fibroblasts the\n\nantibody recognized OCT4A. The OCT4-pg4 protein has yet to\n\nbe detected by any anti-OCT4 antibody, and OCT4-pg3 localizes\n\nto the cytoplasm [51]. The sc-8629, another C-terminal specific\n\nantibody, recognized nuclear OCT4A in hESCs and cytoplasmic\n\nproteins in both control and treated fibroblasts. Cytoplasmic\n\nstaining in both fibroblasts may be identifying OCT4A, OCT4B,\n\nOCT4pg1 [42], and/or OCT4-pg3 [51]. These data corroborate\n\nour previously published results [35] and indicate that expression\n\nof OCT4 in somatic cells is under the control of an oxygen and\n\nFGF2-sensitive mechanism.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOCT4 has received considerable attention during the past years\n\nand its expression has been reported in various cell types and\n\nacross a spectrum of differentiation cell states. Due to the\n\npossibility of multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms, as\n\nwell as expressed pseudogenes being detected, more rigorous\n\nanalyses of OCT4 are required [44,46]. Existence of high number\n\nof pseudogenes for OCT4 is not an exception. Excessive frequency\n\nof pseudogenes for embryonic stem cells-specific genes was also\n\ndescribed for Nanog (10 pseudogenes), Stella (16 pseudogenes),\n\nand Cripto-1 (6 pseudogenes) [47,52].\n\nWe identified expression of Oct-4pg1, Oct-4pg3 and Oct-4pg4\n\npseudogenes in normal adult human fibroblasts using PCR based\n\napproach followed by pseudogene-specific restriction digestion and\n\nsequencing. Our study confirms that expression of OCT4A\n\nprotein is exclusive to hESCs and germ cell-derived tumor cell\n\nFigure 3. RT-PCR for expression of embryonic stem cell specific genes.

None of the other examined somatic cells, somatic tumor cell\n\nlines or adult stem cells expressed OCT4A. In an exact opposite\n\npattern, all cell types examined except hESCs and germ cell\n\ntumor-derived cell lines expressed pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4.\n\nMonitoring the relationship between OCT4A expression and\n\nexpression of pseudogenes in hESCs during differentiation, an\n\ninteresting pattern emerges; a gradual decrease of OCT4A occurs\n\nin a parallel with an increase in expression of pseudogenes. This\n\nmay indicate a tight regulatory relationship between OCT4A and\n\nits pseudogenes, even though the OCT4 gene and all the\n\npseudogenes are located on different chromosomes [47]. One of\n\nthe pseudogenes, namely OCT4-pg3 is located within the 445 kb\n\nof NANOG, STELLA and GDF3 locus on chromosome 12 [56],\n\nsignificance of which still needs to be examined.\n\nIt is interesting that similar changes occur in reverse during\n\nacquisition of regeneration competence in adult human fibroblasts.\n\nAfter a short term culture in reduced oxygen and supplementation\n\nwith FGF2 [35,38] human fibroblast cease expressing OCT4\n\npseudogenes in favor of OCT4A. We have reported previously\n\nthat these cells do not acquire the pluripotent phenotype [35], but\n\nrather undergo a phenotype switch that demonstrates regeneration\n\ncompetence in vivo [38]. Cells demonstrate an increased life span,\n\ndoubled population doubling capacity, maintain a normal\n\nkaryotype and do not form tumors in SCID mice. They do,\n\nhowever, demonstrate long term engraftment and acquire PAX7\n\npositive phenotype when transplanted into a skeletal muscle defect\n\nin mice [38]. Significance and relevance of OCT4A expression, if\n\nany, during acquisition of regeneration competence, is not clear\n\nand is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, this is the first\n\nstudy in which a switch from pseudogene to OCT4A expression\n\nhas been reported and induced by selective manipulation of\n\nculture conditions. We speculate that pseudogene silencing is\n\ninduced in adult somatic cells using our culture system, an event\n\nthat may be required for re-activation of OCT4A. While clearly\n\nnot pluripotent, regeneration-competent cells express low levels of\n\nOCT4A. It has been shown that OCT4 is controlling pluripotency\n\nin a quantitative manner [57]. Specifically, high level of OCT4\n\nexpression drives ES cells to endoderm and mesoderm lineages,\n\nwhile stem cells with low level of OCT4 differentiate into\n\ntrophoectoderm. Only a specific level of OCT4 can maintain\n\nstem cells in a pluripotent state. These observations suggest that\n\nOCT4 is different from many known transcription regulators that\n\nappear to function in an on-off manner. Consequently, low levels\n\nof embryonic OCT4A may not be functionally relevant for either\n\ninduction or maintenance of pluripotency, but may be relevant for\n\ninduction of this novel regeneration-competent cell phenotype.\n\nOur data indicate that chromatin plasticity may be an inherent\n\nfeature of adult fibroblasts and that the manifestation of this\n\nplasticity may be influenced by the extracellular environment. Our\n\ndata also support the notion that regeneration competence does\n\nnot depend on cell pluripotency and may be regulated by a novel,\n\nOCT4A-dependent mechanism.

Neither OCT4 nor its\n\npseudogenes, for example, are required for multipotency of human\n\nstromal cells from different tissues [49]. There is no common\n\nregulatory network that has been shown to exist between the\n\nvarious somatic stem cell types and that can be compared to gene\n\nregulatory network that maintains pluripotency in ES cells with\n\nOCT4 as its cornerstone [52,58]. It is more likely that\n\nFigure 5. Protein expression of stem cell specific genes.

Misidentification of OCT4 in\n\nsomatic tissues and cancer cell lines can also result from detection\n\nof pseudogene transcripts by RT-PCR and/or nuclear detection of\n\npseudogene proteins by ICC. Most studies indeed do not exclude\n\nthe possibilities of pseudogene expression [16,44,46,59] and do not\n\ndistinguish between OCT4 isoforms [46]. All OCT4 protein\n\nisoforms are identical in their C-terminal region and distinct in N-\n\nterminal region so the location of the epitope recognized by any\n\nanti-OCT4 antibody should be considered first [42,46] and\n\ncombined with a diligent analysis of the OCT4 transcript. Adding\n\nthe possibility that OCT4 pseudogenes translate into proteins and\n\nthat OCT4-pg1 can localize to the nucleus [51] and confer\n\ntranscriptional activation of some reporter gene constructs [48],\n\ndiligent analysis should be employed. This may likely require a\n\ncombination of experimental approaches, such as RT-PCR,\n\nrestriction analysis for various pseudogenes, and protein analysis.\n\nAdditional functional studies, such as chromatin immunoprecip-\n\nitation, electromobility shift assay and/or transcription analysis of\n\ndownstream genes may need to be included to reach a valid\n\nconclusion.\n\nBesides accurately characterizing OCT4 expression, relevance\n\nof OCT4 expression should be considered for each chosen\n\nexperimental system. While OCT4A expression may be critically\n\nimportant when studying pluripotency and self-renewal, examin-\n\ning expression of OCT4A in studies involving stem cells from adult\n\ncompartments or in somatic cell cancers may be of little functional\n\nrelevance [59,60].\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Differences between Oct4 pseudogenes based\non the coding sequences.

However, the identity of its gene product\nhas remained undiscovered. We now show that mgr encodes the\nPrefoldin subunit counterpart of human von Hippel Lindau bind-\ning-protein 1. Depletion of Mgr from cultured cells also leads to\nformation of monopolar and abnormal spindles and centrosome\nloss. These phenotypes are associated with reductions of tubulin\nlevels in both mgr flies and mgr RNAi-treated cultured cells. More-\nover, mgr spindle defects can be phenocopied by depleting \u03b2-tu-\nbulin, suggesting Mgr function is required for tubulin stability.\nInstability of \u03b2-tubulin in the mgr larval brain is less pronounced\nthan in either mgr testes or in cultured cells. However, expression\nof transgenic \u03b2-tubulin in the larval brain leads to increased tubu-\nlin instability, indicating that Prefoldin might only be required\nwhen tubulins are synthesized at high levels. Mgr interacts with\nDrosophila von Hippel Lindau protein (Vhl). Both proteins interact\nwith unpolymerized tubulins, suggesting they cooperate in regu-\nlating tubulin functions. Accordingly, codepletion of Vhl with Mgr\ngives partial rescue of tubulin instability, monopolar spindle for-\nmation, and loss of centrosomes, leading us to propose a require-\nment for Vhl to promote degradation of incorrectly folded tubulin\nin the absence of functional Prefoldin. Thus, Vhl may play a pivotal\nrole: promoting microtubule stabilization when tubulins are cor-\nrectly folded by Prefoldin and tubulin destruction when they are not.\n\nfolding | chaperone | Gim | E3 ubiquitin ligase\n\nEukaryotes have a complex molecular machinery that promotesthe folding and assembly of the actin and tubulin subunits\nof microfilaments and microtubules (MTs). Several protein\ncomplexes and ancillary proteins are involved in assembling\n\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers: chaperonin containing tailless protein (CCT),\nthe prefoldin complex, phosducin-like CCT regulatory proteins,\nand five cofactors [reviewed by Lundin et al. (1)]. Prefoldin is\na hexameric protein complex (2) thought to bind to partially\nfolded tubulin and actin molecules from the ribosome (3\u20135).\nOne component of the prefoldin complex also interacts with\n\nthe tumor suppressor Von Hippel Lindau (Vhl) protein and is\nknown as Von Hippel Lindau binding protein 1 (VBP1) (6). The\nVhl protein is a multifunctional adapter protein that influences\nmultiple transcriptional pathways (for review, see refs. 7 and 8),\nas well as the functions of the collagen IV and fibronectin ex-\ntracellular matrix and MTs. Its best-characterized function is in\na complex with Cullin2 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that\ntargets hypoxia-inducible factor \u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) for destruction (9, 10).\nVhl interacts with the CCT to mediate the formation of the Vhl-\nElonginB/C-Cullin2 complex (VBC) (11\u201315). Therefore, the in-\nteraction between Vhl and the prefoldin complex could be rele-\nvant for the folding of the VBC. However, Vhl also interacts with\ncytoplasmic MTs: in mitosis to influence spindle orientation (16)\nand in interphase to inhibit catastrophe and promote rescue (17,\n18). Such an effect could account for the role of Vhl in stabilizing\n\nMTs in Drosophila follicle cells to maintain the integrity of this\nepithelium (19). Vhl is also required with the GSK-3\u03b2 protein\nkinase to maintain the stability of the ciliary axoneme (20\u201322).\nGenetic studies first identified prefoldin in yeast through\n\nmutants that could still fold tubulin but more slowly (hence the\nname GIM: genes involved in microtubule biogenesis) (23). Loss\nof prefoldin in Caenorhabditis elegans is lethal because of a high\ndemand for tubulin in mitotic cells in the embryo (24). In plants,\nprefoldin 6 has been shown to be required for normal MT\ndynamics and organization (25). Knockout of Prefoldin 1 or\nmutation in Prefoldin 5 of mice lead to a variety of defects\ncharacteristic of tubulin functions in cilia or in the CNS (26, 27).\nWe now identify merry-go-round (mgr), a Drosophila gene\n\nidentified over two decades ago, as encoding the prefoldin 3\n(Pfdn3)/VBP1/Gim2 subunit. We show that the characteristic\nmonopolar mitotic spindles of this mutant arise because of di-\nminished levels of tubulin subunits. We also show that mgr\nmutants cannot stabilize tubulin following overexpression of\na tubulin transgene. Finally, our studies show that Mgr can\nphysically interact with Vhl. Moreover, depletion of Vhl rescues\nthe destabilization of tubulin resulting from loss of Mgr. This\nfinding leads us to suggest that the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase\nproperties of Vhl may be required for the degradation of in-\ncorrectly folded tubulin, suggesting that Vhl can also contribute\nto MT dynamics through the regulation of tubulin degradation.\n\nResults\nMgr Is a Subunit of the Highly Conserved Gim Complex/Prefoldin. The\nmgr gene was originally recovered as an X-ray\u2013induced mutant\nresulting in lethality late in development associated with circular\nmitotic figures in larval neuroblasts (28). We confirmed this\nphenotype by immunostaining the CNS to reveal MTs and cen-\ntrosomal antigens in several mutant alleles of mgr and by counting\nproportions of cells at different stages of mitosis (Fig. 1 A and B,\n\nAuthor contributions: N.

The prometaphase-like cells in such\npreparations could have bipolar spindles that may lack one or\nboth centrosomes or monopolar spindles having one or two\n\ncentrosomes at the single pole (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 A and B).\nThese centrosomes were positive for several known Drosophila\ncentrosomal antigens (Fig. S1B). The mitotic index was elevated\nsome twofold over that in wild-type larval brains and the ratio of\nmetaphase:anaphase figures was elevated by two- to threefold\nover wild-type, depending upon the allelic combination (Fig. 1B).\nTaken together, these data are indicative of a delay in pro-\ngression through the mitotic cycle. Previous phase-contrast\nimages of spermatocytes of mgr mutants suggested the absence\nof meiotic spindles (28). To determine whether this suggestion\nwas correct, we used an antibody recognizing both the \u03b21-tubulin\nisoform and the \u03b22-tubulin male germ-line\u2013specific isoform to\nimmunostain the testes of mgrl4/mgr5 transheterozygotes, a strong\nhypomorphic mutant combination that shows pharate lethality\nbut gives some sterile adults. This process revealed thatmgrl4/mgr5\n\nhad sufficient MTs to permit the premeiotic mitosis (arrowheads\nand magnification in Fig. 1C). However, mature (white dashed\noutlined cysts) but not young primary spermatocyte cysts had\nreduced MTs (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C) such that the meiotic spin-\ndles were either absent or highly abnormal (Fig. 1D). Western\nblotting with antibodies specific for \u03b1-tubulin, \u03b21-tubulin, and \u03b22-\ntubulin (29) showed that the levels of all three tubulins were re-\nduced in mgrl4/mgr5 mutant testes (Fig. 1E), thus accounting for\nthe spindle defects.\nTo understand why reduction in levels of the mgr gene product\n\nmight have such an effect on tubulin levels, we set out to identify\nthe mgr gene product. Small deficiencies [Df(3R)thoR1, Df(3R)\npros235, and Df(3R)pros640] (30), which each fail to complement\nmgr, placed the mgr gene to 86E4 in a region containing 14\npredicted genes (Fig. S2 A and B). Using a combination of RNAi\nto identify mitotic phenotypes resulting from the knockdown of\neach of these genes (Fig. S2 C\u2013F) together with the sequencing\nof candidate genes from chromosomes carrying mgr mutant\nalleles, we identified the predicted gene CG6719 as mgr. We\nconfirmed its identity by showing that lethality of mgrl4/mgr1\n\nmutant, a combination showing pharate lethality, could be res-\ncued with a CG6719 transgene. In addition to the mitotic phe-\nnotype, RNAi-mediated knockdown of mgr led to a reduction of\ncytoplasmic MTs in interphase cells (Fig. S2G).\nSequencing of the mgr mutant alleles revealed them to repre-\n\nsent a variety of deletion, frame-shift, and nonsense mutations\n(Fig. S2H and SI Materials and Methods). In this study we focused\non two mutant alleles:mgrl4, a null mutant having a deletion in the\n5\u2032UTR; and mgr5, which because of a nonsense mutation, pro-\nduces a truncated protein (not detectable by Western blot) and\nadditionally carries a 41-bp deletion in its 3\u2032UTR. Immunostain-\ning on wild-type cells using the anti-Mgr antibody we generated\nshowed that the protein localizes throughout the cytoplasm in\ntestis, brain, and cultured cells at all cell-cycle stages (Fig. S3).\nWestern blots on protein extracts of testes and larval CNS con-\nfirmed that the protein was not detectable in mgrl4/mgr5 mutants\n(Fig. 1F). The sequence of mgr revealed it to encode a subunit of\nthe Gim/prefoldin complex; Mgr shows 37% amino acid identity\nwith its yeast homolog PAC10 and 57% with its human homolog\nVBP1/Pfdn3/Gim2. Thus, the phenotypes of mgr mutants would\nbe consistent with the improper folding and degradation of tubulin\nin the absence of the Prefoldin complex. The greater reductions in\ntubulin levels in the testes than in the CNS would account for the\nstronger phenotype in the spermatocytes (Fig. 1F).\n\nSpindle Abnormalities Result from Tubulin Destabilization Following\nMgr Depletion. To gain further insight into how Mgr depletion\naffects spindle formation, we turned to RNAi in the DMEL-2\nDrosophila cell line (Fig. 2). Transfection with mgr dsRNA for\n6 d increased the proportion of cells with monopolar spindles\nsimilar in appearance to those seen in mgr mutant neuroblasts\nand greatly above the background level of mitotic abnormalities\ntypical of this cell line (Fig. 2 A and B).

Codepletion of BubR1 or\nMad2 and Mgr led to a decrease of abnormal spindles and a\nrestoration of a normal mitotic index compared with mgr RNAi\nalone (Fig. S4). These results suggest that cells are delayed in\nmitotic progression after Mgr depletion in response to the spindle\nassembly check point. To determine whether spindle abnormali-\nties were related to centrosome defects, we counted Dplp+ punc-\ntae in interphase cells after the same period of Mgr depletion.\nThis process revealed a progressive loss of centrosomes from\ncells lagging behind the appearance of spindle defects such that\n40% of cells had no centrosomes by day 12 (Fig. 2 C and D). This\nlag in the loss of centrosomes could be because of either or both\ndefects in centrosome duplication or segregation as a conse-\nquence of the spindle defects. To address whether Mgr depletion\naffected centriole structure, we carried out electron microscopy,\nwhich revealed abnormalities typical of centriole duplication/\nformation defects; 20% of the centrioles were incomplete and\ncomposed of singlet MTs rather than doublets or triplets, as in\ncontrol cells (Fig. 2E).\nImmunoblotting revealed that Mgr depletion led to a reduc-\n\ntion in \u03b2-tubulin levels by \u223c70% (Fig. 2F), also apparent by\nimmunofluorescence (Fig. S2G). Depletion of the Pfdn4 Pre-\nfoldin subunit also led not only to a similar reduction in \u03b2-\ntubulin, but also in Mgr levels, indicating the importance of\ninteractions between subunits of the complex for its stability.\nLevels of \u03b3-tubulin were reduced by \u223c50%, whereas actin was\nunaffected (Fig. S5 A and B). To determine whether the spindle\nand centrosome defects resulting from Mgr depletion might re-\nflect the reduction in tubulin levels, we performed partial de-\npletion of \u03b2- and \u03b3-tubulin (Fig. 2 G\u2013K and Fig. S5 C\u2013J). DMEL-\n2 cells were treated with varying amounts of \u03b2- or \u03b3-tubulin\ndsRNA and assayed for spindle defects and centrosome numbers\nafter 6 d. An increase in monopolar and disorganized spindles\nand in centrosome loss mirrored the extent of \u03b2- and \u03b3-tubulin\nknockdown. However, only the \u03b2-tubulin knockdown recapitulated\nthe small spindle size observed after mgr RNAi (Fig. S5D).\nMoreover, \u03b3-tubulin knockdown leads to a population of bipolar\nspindles with the centrosomes at one pole only (Fig. S5E), which\nwas not observed after mgr RNAi or partial depletion of \u03b2-tu-\nbulin. Thus, the mitotic defects that follow loss of Mgr appear to\nbe largely a consequence of tubulin destabilization. To assess if\nthe structural defects observed on the centrioles after mgr RNAi\nwas a consequence of \u03b1\u03b2- or \u03b3-tubulin depletion, we carried out\nelectron microscopy in cells partially depleted for 6 d for \u03b2- or\n\u03b3-tubulin. These analyses failed to reveal any centriolar structural\ndefects in either case (Fig. S5 I and J). However, the difficulties in\nassessing the level and timing of \u03b2- or \u03b3-tubulin depletion that\nwould be equivalent to that seen following mgr RNAi, together\nwith the restricted numbers of centrioles that can be observed by\nelectron microscopy in such experiments, makes it difficult to\nreach a firm conclusion about the effects on centrioles.\n\nLevels of Free \u03b1\u03b2-Tubulin Sensitize Mgr Activity. The above studies\nshowed that MTs of different tissues present different sensitivity\nto reduced Mgr levels (Fig. 1). Moreover, even in mgr testes,\nwhere disruption of the MT network is most pronounced, it only\noccurs once primary spermatocytes have reached a late stage in\ntheir development.

This finding\nsuggests that the onset of synthesis of the \u03b22-tubulin testes spe-\ncific isoform in late spermatogenesis might bring a particular\nrequirement for Mgr (31, 32). If this were the case, we wondered\nwhether increased synthesis of \u03b21-tubulin from a transgene might\ntrigger a stronger requirement for Mgr in larval neuroblasts (Fig.\n3). We found that in mgrl4/mgr5 mutant neuroblasts the level of\nendogenous \u03b2-tubulin was only slightly reduced (by 25% com-\npared with wild-type levels). The additional expression of \u03b21-\ntubulin\u2013GFP did not drastically affect endogenous \u03b2-tubulin\nlevels if one wild-type copy of mgr was present (mgr5/+;\u03b21-\ntubulin\u2013GFP, a reduction of 15% compared with wild-type).\nHowever, in mgrl4/mgr5 mutants, expression of \u03b21-tubulin\u2013GFP\nleads to a further decrease in levels of endogenous \u03b2-tubulin by\n60% compared with wild-type levels (Fig. 3 A and B). There was\nalso a dramatic loss ofMT staining in immunostained preparations\nof the larval CNS of such organisms (Fig. 3C). Taken together,\nthese results suggest that if tubulin levels exceed a certain thresh-\nold, this overproduced tubulin may change the complex balance of\nfolding, causing a synthetically lethal phenotype with mgr.\n\nA 5\n\nmg\nr5\n\nmg\nrl4;\n\n;\n\nCtrl\n\n\u03b2-tub\n\nGFP\n\nW\nT m\n\ngr\nl4\n\nmg\nr5 \u03b2tu\n\nb-G\nFP\n\n\u03b2tu\nb-G\n\nFP\n\u03b2tu\n\nb-G\nFP\n\n\u03b2tu\nb G\n\nFP\nmg\n\nr\n+;\n\n;\n\nC\n\n\u03b2tub-GFP;\nmgr5/+\n\n\u03b2tub-GFP;\nmgr5/mgrl4\n\nmgr5/mgrl4WT\n\n%\n o\n\nf \u03b2\n-tu\n\nbu\nlin\n\n le\nve\n\nls\n re\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne \nto\n\n c\non\n\ntro\nl\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nWT \u03b2tub\n-GFP;\n\nmgr5\nmgrl4\n\nmgr5\n+\n\n\u03b2tub\n-GFP;\nmgr5\nmgrl4\n\nB\n\n\u03b2-tubulin\n\n148\n\n50\n\nFig. 3.

Several lines of evidence in-\ndicated that Mgr was able to interact with Drosophila Vhl and\nthat both proteins could interact with tubulin monomers and\ndimers. First, beads carrying Maltose binding protein (MBP)-Mgr\nor MBP-Vhl fusion proteins synthesized in bacteria could bind\n35S-labeled Mgr or Vhl synthesized by coupled transcription-\ntranslation in vitro (Fig. 4A). This experiment also indicated that\nboth proteins could undertake self-self interactions. Second,\nboth Mgr and Vhl synthesized in bacteria were able to bind\n35S-labeled \u03b21-tubulin synthesized by coupled transcription-\ntranslation in vitro (Fig. S6 A and B). Conversely \u03b21-tubulin\nsynthesized in bacteria would interact with 35S-labeled Vhl or\nMgr (Fig. S6 C and D). Third, MBP-tagged Mgr or MBP-tagged\nVhl immobilized on beads directly bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers (Fig.\n4 B and C). Fourth, we were unable to disrupt a complex formed\nbetween bacterially expressed MBP-Vhl and 35S-labeled Mgr by\nadding dimeric \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (Fig. 4D). Instead the Vhl:Mgr com-\nplex also bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer. However, whereas Drosophila\nVhl, like mammalian Vhl, could interact with MTs (Fig. S6 E and\nF), Mgr could not. This finding suggests that Mgr can interact\nwith free, but not with polymerized, tubulin.\nTo test whether the interaction between Vhl and Mgr played\n\nany part in the control of tubulin degradation, we asked what the\nconsequences would be if Mgr and Vhl were to be codepleted.\nVhl RNAi alone had little effect on the levels of \u03b2-tubulin in\ncultured cells (Fig. 4 E and F), confirming the recent finding of\nDuchi and colleagues (19). Moreover, Vhl depletion resulted in\nonly a slight increase in the proportion of mitotic cells with\nmonopolar or disorganized spindles or lacking centrosomes (Fig.\n4 G\u2013J). In contrast, Mgr depletion resulted in a clear decrease in\n\u03b2-tubulin levels, formation of monopolar/disorganized spindles\nin the majority of mitotic cells, and an increase of the number of\ncells without centrosomes. We found all three of these pheno-\ntypes were significantly rescued by the codepletion of Vhl (Fig. 4\nE and J). Thus, the proteolytic destruction of tubulin, which takes\nplace when tubulin cannot be correctly folded by the Prefoldin\nchaperone, requires the function of the Vhl protein.\n\nDiscussion\nThe finding that the Drosophila merry-go-round gene encodes\na subunit of the Prefoldin complex has allowed us to account for\naberrant structure and function of spindles and centrosomes in\ncells depleted of its gene product. The inability to correctly fold\ntubulins in Prefoldin-deficient cells leads to tubulin instability\nand, hence, defects that can be phenocopied by depleting \u03b2- or\n\u03b3-tubulin. However, whereas \u03b2-tubulin depletion phenocopied all\nof the defects observed, \u03b3-tubulin depletion only recapitulated\nsome of them. The more dramatic phenotypes seen in Mgr-de-\nficient cells expressing high levels of tubulin (primary spermato-\ncytes and neuroblasts expressing a \u03b2-tubulin transgene) suggest\nthat the Prefoldin complex is critical to maintain tubulin levels\nabove a certain threshold of tubulin expression. This finding could\nbe a consequence of the impact of an excess of tubulin upon its\ncomplex folding pathway. Interestingly, in mammalian cells, in-\ncreased soluble tubulin, in response to a MT-destabilizing agent,\nleads to the rapid degradation of tubulin (33, 34). In Drosophila,\ntubulins in the testes are the most affected by the absence of\nMgr compared with other tissues. Indeed, it may be of particular\nimportance to regulate tubulin levels at the late stages of\n\nspermatogenesis, where the very large meiotic cells are provided\nwith proportionally large amounts of tubulin that are used in the\nmeiotic spindle but have a major additional purpose: the building\nof the sperm tail. Similarly, in the mouse, the effects of depletion\nor mutation of prefoldin subunits are largely restricted to the\nbrain, where tubulin levels are also very high (26, 27). Whether\nthis tissue specificity is a consequence of tubulin levels will be an\ninteresting question to address. Finally, our demonstration that\nVhl is required for tubulin destruction in the absence of Mgr and\nthe ability of Vhl to interact with tubulin monomers and dimers\nraises the possibility that its role as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase\ncould come to play in regulating tubulin levels.\nThe idea that Vhl and Prefoldin can cooperate in regulating\n\nprotein stability was also raised by Mousnier et al. (35), who\nidentified the prefoldin subunit VBP1 as a binding partner of the\nHIV-1 viral integrase and suggested this mediated the interaction\nof the integrase with the Cul2-Vhl E3-Ubiquitin ligase. This\nfinding led these authors to suggest a role for prefoldin at a pivotal\npart of the pathway that would determine whether a protein was\npassed on to the CCT chaperonin for folding or to the protea-\nsome for degradation (35). Similarly, we can speculate that pre-\nfoldin as a partner of Vhl may well serve a key role in regulating\nthe equilibrium between tubulin targeted for destruction or for\nfolding and incorporation into MTs. The concentration of as-\nsembly-competent tubulin must be tightly controlled because it\naffects cytoskeletal dynamics. Vhl might contribute to this in-\nfluence by an effect on MT dynamics through interaction with\nMAPs on the MT lattice (17, 18) and by intervening in the reg-\nulation of tubulin folding. There is growing evidence for a critical\nfunction of Vhl in stabilizing cytoplasmic MTs (16, 17) and axo-\nnemal MTs in response to levels of soluble tubulin (36). Re-\nciprocally, MT stability can contribute to regulating levels of\nproteins that are targets of the Cul2-Vhl E3-Ubiquitin ligase, such\nas the HIF proteins, the levels of which fall when their mRNAs\naccumulate in cytoplasmic P-bodies for translational repression\nfollowing MT disruption (37). It will be important in future to\nconsider the roles played by the Prefoldin complex and Vhl to\nunderstand the interrelationships between the machinery regu-\nlating tubulin levels in relation toMT stability, both in normal and\ntumor cells.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nBriefly, testes from pupae and CNS from third-instar larvae were dissected in\nPBS andfixedwithmethanol before proceeding to immunostaining. Cultured\ncells were pre-extracted before fixation with paraformaldehyde and\nimmunostaining. Depletion of proteins in cultured cells was performed by\ntransfection of dsRNA with transfast reagent. Protein extracts were obtained\nafter homogeneization of cells, CNS or testes in lysis buffer. Protein inter-\nactions were tested in vitro using either recombinant commercially available\ntubulins (Cytoskeleton), proteins produced in bacteria, or proteins translated\nin reticulocyte lysate.\n\nA more detailed description of gene constructs, cell culture, immunocy-\ntochemistry, dsRNA, microscopy, protein purification, Western blot analysis,\nin vitro binding assays, fly genetics, and primers list can be found in the SI\nMaterials and Methods and Table S1.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

Crucial to the pathogenesis of this\nintracellular pathogen is its ability to subvert host cell defenses, permitting intracellular replication in\nspecialized vacuoles within host cells. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocates a large\nnumber of bacterial effectors into host cell, is absolutely required for rerouting the Legionella phagosome. Many\nLegionella effectors display distinctive eukaryotic domains, among which are protein kinase domains. In silico\nanalysis and in vitro phosphorylation assays identified five functional protein kinases, LegK1 to LegK5,\nencoded by the epidemic L. pneumophila Lens strain. Except for LegK5, the Legionella protein kinases are all\nT4SS effectors. LegK2 plays a key role in bacterial virulence, as demonstrated by gene inactivation. The legK2\nmutant containing vacuoles displays less-efficient recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum markers, which\nresults in delayed intracellular replication. Considering that a kinase-dead substitution mutant of legK2\nexhibits the same virulence defects, we highlight here a new molecular mechanism, namely, protein phosphor-\nylation, developed by L. pneumophila to establish a replicative niche and evade host cell defenses.\n\nLegionella pneumophila is the most common causative agent\nof the atypical and severe pneumonia legionellosis. Pathogenic\nLegionella strains emerge from the environment after intracel-\nlular multiplication in phagocytic protozoans. It has been pro-\nposed that its ability to exploit the basic cellular mechanisms of\nnumerous protozoal hosts also enables Legionella to infect\nhuman macrophages of alveolar lungs and consequently to\ncause disease (29, 63).\n\nMechanisms of infection of protozoans and macrophages by\nL. pneumophila are quite similar (24). Upon internalization of\nL. pneumophila, the bacteria containing phagosome avoids fu-\nsion with lysosomes and recruits mitochondria and endoplas-\nmic reticulum (ER) to establish a replication niche. The Dot/\nIcm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocates\nbacterial proteins called \u201ceffectors\u201d into host cell, is absolutely\nrequired to reprogram the endosomal-lysosomal degradation\npathway of the phagocytic cell and to lead to bacterial intra-\ncellular survival and successful replication (3, 5, 64, 67). Mul-\ntiple approaches have successfully identified more than 100\neffector proteins (reviewed by reference 22). Many Legionella\neffectors display distinctive eukaryotic domains, such as those\ninvolved in protein-protein interactions (e.g., ankyrin repeats,\nleucine-rich repeats, and coiled coils), and domains with more\ndefined activities (protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases, sphin-\n\ngosine-1-phosphate lyases, phospholipases, and guanine nucle-\notide exchange factors). In spite of the fact that L. pneumo-\nphila seems well equipped with proteins adapted to interfere\nwith a wide variety of host cell processes, only a minority of\nthese effectors have been functionally characterized (7, 18, 21,\n30, 40, 44, 48, 49, 54, 56, 61, 72, 73).\n\nThe genomes of the five sequenced L. pneumophila strains\u2014\nPhiladelphia, Lens, Paris, Corby, and Alcoy\u2014have been re-\nported to encode four eukaryote-like serine/threonine kinases\n(8, 15, 16, 26). Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of proteins\nat serine/threonine/tyrosine residues represents a powerful\nregulatory mechanism of cellular activity. Indeed, intensive\nresearch has revealed that eukaryotes contain numerous inter-\nconnected signal transduction networks in which protein phos-\nphorylation plays a dominant role. For many years, however,\nphosphorylation at serine/threonine/tyrosine has been consid-\nered a new addition to the cell\u2019s regulatory arsenal and be-\nlieved to be exclusive to eukaryotes. Due in large part to\ngenomic sequencing programs, some \u201cclassical\u201d serine/threo-\nnine/tyrosine protein kinases have been identified in several\nbacterial genomes, but the function of most of them remains\nunknown (13, 19). Interestingly, some of these enzymes have\nbeen recently described to play a critical role in virulence of\nseveral pathogenic bacteria: PknG of Mycobacterium tubercu-\nlosis (71), YpkA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (4), and SteC of\nSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (59) are translocated\ninto the host cell cytoplasm to modulate eukaryotic signal\ntransduction to the bacteria advantage and thus contribute to\nvirulence. Moreover, StkP of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a\nglobal regulator of gene expression that positively controls\nvirulence for lung infection and bloodstream invasion (20, 66),\nSP-STK of Streptococcus pyogenes has been reported to have\n\n* Corresponding author.

We report that the five putative\nprotein kinases identified by in silico analysis of the L. pneu-\nmophila genomes are functional in terms of phosphorylation;\nactually, they can autophosphorylate and undergo in vitro\nphosphorylation of classical eukaryotic protein kinase sub-\nstrates. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the protein kinase\nLegK2 plays a key role in the virulence of Legionella toward\namoebae. More precisely, we observed that the legK2 mutant is\nimpaired in ER recruitment and intracellular replication. Since\nLegK2 is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm during in-\nfection, we assume that this protein kinase would interfere with\nhost cell signal transduction pathways to subvert host cell de-\nfenses to the bacteria benefit, thus resulting in an effective\ninfectious cycle and virulence.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nGrowth of bacteria and phagocytes. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in\nthe present study are summarized in Table 1.\n\nL. pneumophila strains were grown at 30\u00b0C either on buffered charcoal yeast\nextract (BCYE) agar or in BYE liquid medium; each medium was supplemented\nwith kanamycin at 10 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 or chloramphenicol at 5 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 when appropri-\nate. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37\u00b0C in LB medium supplemented\nwith ampicillin at 100 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1, kanamycin at 20 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1, or chloramphenicol at\n5 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1. E. coli XL1-Blue was used to maintain plasmids and strain E. coli\nBL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL) was used for recombinant protein overproduction.\n\nAxenic Acanthamoeba castellanii cells were grown on PYG medium (proteose-\nyeast extract-glucose medium) at 30\u00b0C and split once a week. Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum expressing calnexin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (DBS0236184)\nwas obtained from the Dicty Stock Center (depositor A. Mu\u0308ller-Taubenberger\n[55]). D. discoideum cells were axenically grown in HL5 medium at 22\u00b0C, sup-\nplemented with G418 at 20 \ufffdg ml\ufffd1 when necessary.\n\nJ774A.1 macrophages were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640\nmedium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.\n\nGeneral DNA techniques. The oligonucleotides used in the present study are\nshown in Table 2.\n\nStandard techniques were used for nucleic acid cloning and restriction analy-\nsis. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Fermentas\n(Saint Re\u0301my-les-Chevreuses, France). Plasmid DNA from E. coli was prepared\nby rapid alkaline lysis (31). PCR amplifications were carried out with Phusion\npolymerase as recommended by the manufacturer (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland).\nPurification of DNA fragments from agarose gels for subcloning was carried out\nwith a QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France).\n\nExpression and purification of recombinant proteins. DNA fragments corre-\nsponding to the coding sequences of legK1 (lpl1545), legK2 (lpl2066), legK3\n(lpl2481), legK4 (lpl0262), and legK5 (lpl2476) were PCR amplified using genomic\nDNA of L. pneumophila Lens as the template and the following oligonucleotide\npairs: for legK1, 1/2; for legK2, 3/4; for legK3, 5/6; for legK4, 7/8; and for legK5,\n9/10. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and SalI or with\nSacI and PstI for legK5 and then inserted into PGEX-6P-3 for legK1, legK2, and\nlegK3 or pQE30 for legK4 and legK5. The resulting plasmids\u2014pGEX-legK1,\npGEX-legK2, pGEX-legK3, pQE30-legK4, and pQE30-legK5\u2014were introduced\ninto E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL). Transformants were grown at\n37\u00b0C until cultures reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.7. Gene\nexpressions were induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyrano-\nside) for 4 h at 20\u00b0C, and cell lysates were prepared by using a French pressure\ncell (SLM, Urbana, IL). GST and 6His recombinant proteins were purified under\nnative conditions by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads\n(GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) and a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen), respectively,\naccording to the manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. The purity of the eluted\nprotein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were deter-\nmined by using a protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-\nCoquette, France).\n\nIn vitro phosphorylation assay. In vitro phosphorylation of about 2 \ufffdg of\npurified recombinant protein was performed for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in 20 \ufffdl of a\n\nbuffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol,\n10 \ufffdM ATP, and 5 \ufffdCi of [\ufffd-32P]ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France). In\nsome assays, MgCl2 was replaced with MnCl2. In eukaryotic substrate phosphor-\nylation assays, 1 \ufffdg of myelin basic protein (MBP) was added. In each case, the\nreaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2\ufffd Laemmli loading\nbuffer (41).\n\nTEM translocation assays. J774A.1 cells grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10%\nfetal calf serum were seeded in a black, clear-bottom 96-well plate at 105 cells per\nwell 24 h prior to infection. L. pneumophila strains carrying the various TEM\n\ufffd-lactamase fusions were grown on BCYE plates containing chloramphenicol.\nSingle colonies were then streaked onto BCYE plates containing chloramphen-\nicol and 0.5 mM IPTG and grown for 24 h to induce production of the hybrid\nproteins. Then, 10 \ufffdl of bacteria resuspended in RPMI at 5 \ufffd 108 cells ml\ufffd1 was\nused to infect J774A.1 cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] \ufffd 50). After cen-\ntrifugation (600 \ufffd g, 10 min) to initiate bacterium-cell contact, the plate was\nshifted to 37\u00b0C, followed by incubation for 1 h with CO2 exchange. Cell mono-\nlayers were loaded with the fluorescent substrate by adding 20 \ufffdl of 6\ufffd\nCCF4/AM solution (LiveBLAzer-FRET B/G loading kit; Invitrogen, Cergy Pon-\ntoise, France) containing 15 mM Probenecid (Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier,\nFrance). The cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature.\nFluorescence was quantified on a Victor microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer) with\nexcitation at 405 nm (10-nm band-pass), and emission was detected via 460 nm\n(40-nm band-pass, blue fluorescence) and 530 nm (30-nm band-pass, green\nfluorescence) filters. The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using\nan inverted microscope equipped with the \ufffd-lactamase ratiometric filter set\n(Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) (17).\n\nGene inactivation in L. pneumophila. To obtain L. pneumophila Lens mutants\ndefective for legK genes, a homologous recombination strategy was chosen as\npreviously described (23). The 400-bp upstream and downstream regions of the\ngene of interest were amplified by PCR, digested by NotI and SalI, and then\ncloned into pAV695. A kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified from pKD13\n(with the primers 11 and 12), digested by SalI, and cloned inside the encoding\nsequence of each legK gene in pAV695. The resulting construct was introduced\ninto L. pneumophila for chromosomal recombination.\n\nConstruction of a kinase-dead LegK2-producing strain. In order to obtain the\ncatalytic mutant of LegK2, namely, LegK2(K112M) defective in phosphate do-\nnor ATP binding, substitution in the legK2 gene was performed with a\nQuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using primers 40 and\n41 listed in Table 2, and the pXDC50 derivative vector in which legK2 is cloned\nunder its own promoter, namely, plegK2 plasmid, as a template (Table 1). The\nfinal construct was used to transform the L. pneumophila \ufffdlegK2 mutant strain.\n\nPigment production. For quantifying pigment accumulation, 1-ml portions of the\nsamples, obtained from 5-day-old BYE cultures grown at 30\u00b0C, were centrifuged at\n16,000 \ufffd g for 10 min, and the OD550 of the supernatants was measured (65).\n\nCytotoxicity to A. castellanii. For measurement of the number of viable A.\ncastellanii cells remaining after infection, the monolayers were treated with 10%\nAlamar blue (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). At the time point indicated, the\nmonolayers were washed four times with protease-yeast extract (PY), and then 100\n\ufffdl of PY containing 10% (vol/vol) of Alamar blue was added to each well. After an\novernight incubation, the OD570 values were determined. The relative degree of amoeba\nmortality was expressed as the ratio of the OD value of infected monolayer to that of\nuninfected one, calculated as [1 \ufffd (mean ODinfected/mean ODuninfected)] \ufffd 100.\n\nMeasurement of released extracellular bacteria. L. pneumophila was grown on\nBCYE agar for 5 days at 30\u00b0C prior to infection. A. castellanii cells were seeded\nin multiwell plates to a final concentration of 5 \ufffd 105 cells ml\ufffd1. After adhesion,\nthe cells were infected at an MOI of 10 with L. pneumophila. The plates were\ncentrifuged at 880 \ufffd g for 10 min, followed by incubation for 1 h at 30\u00b0C.\nMonolayers were then washed four times with PY to remove extracellular bac-\nteria. The time at the end of the final wash was the initial time point. After 24 h,\nextracellular bacteria were numbered by plating them on BCYE.\n\nIntracellular growth in A. castellanii. Intracellular growth was monitored as\npreviously described (36). L. pneumophila cells harboring a fluorescent mCherry\nprotein-producing plasmid were grown on BCYE agar containing 0.5 mM IPTG\nand chloramphenicol for 5 days at 30\u00b0C. A. castellanii cells were grown as\nadherent cells in 96-well microplates (105 cells/well) and then infected with 106\n\nfluorescent legionellae (MOI \ufffd 10). Infection was synchronized by spinning the\nbacteria at 880 \ufffd g for 10 min. Intracellular growth was automatically monitored\nby measuring the fluorescence of mCherry at an excitation of 587 nm and an\nemission of 610 nm in a Xenius Safas plate reader every hour for 66 h (Safas,\nMonaco). Fluorescence data were subjected to background subtractions (unin-\nfected cells).\n\nBacteria uptake assay by trypan blue quenching. L. pneumophila phagocytosis\nwas measured by trypan blue quenching as previously described (10).

After centrifugation (880 \ufffd g for 10 min) to initiate cell-bacterium\ncontact, the plate was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min.

D. discoideum cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in\n6-well plates at 5 \ufffd 106 per well in HL5 and allowed to adhere overnight.\nMonolayers were infected at an MOI of 100 with bacteria grown for 5 days at\n30\u00b0C. The plates were spun at 880 \ufffd g for 10 min, followed by incubation at 25\u00b0C.\nThe monolayers were then washed two times with 2 ml of SorC buffer (2 mM\nNa2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM CaCl2; pH 6.0) and fixed with 3.7% para-\nformaldehyde (30 min, 4\u00b0C). Coverslips were examined with an inverted confocal\nmicroscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss, Thornwood, NJ) equipped with a \ufffd63 phase-\ncontrast objective lens (Plan Neofluar [Zeiss]; aperture, 1.4, oil).\n\nLocalization of LegK2 within the host cell. The \ufffdlegK2 mutant strain was\ncotransformed with p3041 and pEP73 plasmids (Table 1), which encode mCherry\nand the GFP-LegK2 hybrid protein, respectively. The obtained strain was used to\ninfect D. discoideum DH1 at an MOI of 100 for 1 h. Fluorescent GFP-LegK2\nprotein and mCherry-labeled bacteria were observed with an inverted confocal\nmicroscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss) equipped with a \ufffd63 phase-contrast objec-\ntive (Plan Neofluar). Alternatively, D. discoideum DH1 harboring pEP46 vector\n(Table 1), which ectopically express legK2(K112M)-c-myc, were seeded onto\ncoverslips and infected with mCherry-labeled L. pneumophila legK2 and dotA\nmutant strains or E. coli XL1-Blue as described above. After 1 h of infection, the\ncells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline\nsupplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were then\n\nstained with \r-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (1/5,000, clone 9E10; Sigma) for 1 h\nand visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular\nProbes, Eugene, OR) at a 1/300 dilution for 30 min. Microscopic observations of\nmCherry-labeled bacteria and LegK2 protein were performed with an inverted\nconfocal microscope (Axiovert 200M).\n\nStatistical analysis. The results were statistically analyzed by using a Student\nt test. The t test results obtained correspond to the comparison between legK\nmutants with the parental strain values in the same conditions.\n\nRESULTS\n\nL. pneumophila Lens genome encodes five putative protein\nkinases.

Alignment with several prokaryotic and\neukaryotic protein kinases revealed residues that are highly\nconserved in the Hanks subdomains characterizing the eu-\nkaryote-like protein kinase family (28). These include the gly-\ncine-rich loop and the invariant lysine in subdomains I and II,\nwhich are essential for binding and correct orientation of the\nphosphate donor ATP (Fig. 1A). Consensus sequences in sub-\ndomains VI, VII, and VIII, involved in phosphotransfer and\nsubstrate recognition are also conserved in LegK1, LegK3, and\n\nLegK4; LegK2 and LegK5 lack subdomain VIII (Fig. 1A).\nFurther primary sequence analysis predicted an EF-hand do-\nmain in LegK5, which is known to be involved in calcium\nbinding (53). Moreover, hydropathy profiles suggest a trans-\nmembrane helix between amino acids 478 and 498 of LegK1,\nwhich is consistent with a membrane location of LegK1,\nwhereas LegK2 to LegK5 are likely cytoplasmic (Table 3).\n\nThe protein kinases encoding genes legK1 to legK5 are dis-\ntributed in various regions of the L. pneumophila Lens chro-\n\nTABLE 3.

Organization of the legK4 region is remarkable: legK4\nis located immediately upstream a gene (lpl0263) that encodes\na protein with a high degree of similarity (39% identity) with\nthe C-terminal domain (from amino acid 323 to amino acid\n910) of LegK4. This genetic organization is conserved in the\nfive sequenced L. pneumophila strains and suggests a partial\nduplication of legK4 homologous genes. On the other hand,\nwhereas genes legK1 to legK4 are conserved in all L. pneumo-\nphila sequenced strains, legK5 is specific of strain Lens. It is\nlocated in a chromosomal region containing four genes that\nare absent in Philadelphia, Paris, Corby, and Alcoy genomes\n(Fig. 1B). Compared to the average genomic GC content of\n38.4% for Lens strain (8), legK5 and its neighboring genes have\na significantly lower GC content of 35% (legK5), 34%\n(lpl2477), and 36% (lpl2478). Moreover, lpl2478 gene encodes\na putative transposase, and the region is flanked by two ho-\nmologous genes, namely, lpl2475 and lpl2479 (Fig. 1B). These\nobservations suggest that the legK5 chromosomal region has\nbeen acquired in Lens genome by a small insertion event as-\nsociated with horizontal transfer.\n\nLegK2 to LegK5 display autokinase and protein kinase ac-\ntivities. To determine whether LegK1 to LegK5 are functional\nprotein kinases, each protein was overproduced and purified as\na recombinant protein fused to either six-histidine or glutathi-\none S-transferase tags. The legK4 and legK5 genes were PCR\namplified using genomic DNA of L. pneumophila strain Lens\nand cloned into the expression vector pQE30 to allow the\nsynthesis of N-terminal six-histidine-tagged proteins. The re-\ncombinant proteins, with respective molecular masses of 110\nand 52 kDa, were overproduced in the E. coli strain\nBL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL) and highly enriched by a single-\nstep chromatography on Ni-NTA matrix (Fig. 2A). The full-\nlength legK2 and legK3 genes were synthesized by PCR ampli-\nfication and cloned into pGEX-6P-3 plasmid to produce GST\nN-terminal fused proteins. The truncated legK1 gene (nucleo-\ntides 4 to 1431) lacking the DNA fragment encoding the pu-\ntative transmembrane helix was cloned into the same expres-\nsion vector. The GST-tagged recombinant LegK1 (87 kDa),\nLegK2 (88 kDa), and LegK3 (79 kDa) proteins were purified\nto partial homogeneity from the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)\n(pREP4-groESL) by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix\n(Fig. 2A).\n\nThe purified tagged LegK1-LegK5 proteins were then sep-\narately assayed for autokinase activity. Each recombinant pro-\ntein was incubated with the phosphate donor [\ufffd-32P]ATP and\nthen separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiogra-\nphy (Fig. 2B). Except for GST-LegK1, all Legionella recombi-\nnant kinases were significantly radiolabeled and thus undergo\nautophosphorylation. Their autokinase activities are differently\ndependent of magnesium or manganese ions. Although LegK4\nused these ions as cofactor with the same efficiency, LegK2 and\nLegK5 autophosphorylated more efficiently in the presence of\nmanganese; conversely, the radiolabeling of LegK3 was higher\nin the presence of magnesium (Fig. 2B).\n\nThe recombinant LegK1 to LegK5 proteins were further\ncharacterized by studying their ability to phosphorylate pro-\nteins. They were assayed for in vitro phosphorylation of the\ngeneral eukaryotic protein kinase substrate, myelin basic pro-\ntein (MBP), in the presence of [\ufffd-32P]ATP.

Although\nLegK1, LegK2, and LegK3 have been recently identified as\nDot/Icm T4SS effectors (17, 25, 68), the translocation of LegK4\nand LegK5 has not been documented yet. In order to deter-\nmine whether these protein kinases are translocated during the\ninfectious cycle, the TEM-1 reporter system (\ufffd-lactamase) was\nused (17). Briefly, the TEM-1 was fused to the N-terminal of\nLegK4 and LegK5, and L. pneumophila strains efficiently ex-\npressing these fusions (Fig. 3A) were used to infect J774 mac-\nrophages. Host cells were then loaded with CCF4, which emits\ngreen fluorescence (520 nm) due to fluorescence resonance\n\nenergy transfer between the two fluorophores of this substrate\nwhen excited at 409 nm (Fig. 3B, uninfected). When the hybrid\nprotein was translocated, as expected for the fusion with the\nknown Dot/Icm effector VipA, it cleaved the \ufffd-lactam ring of\nCCF4, thus resulting in fluorescence changing from green to\nblue (447 nm), when excited at the same wavelength (Fig. 3B,\nTEM-VipA). Conversely, when TEM-1 was fused to the\nhousekeeping protein enoyl-acyl coenzyme A reductase FabI,\ncells still developed green fluorescence (Fig. 3B, TEM-FabI).\nEmission of blue fluorescence was observed when cells were\ninfected with wild-type L. pneumophila strains expressing the\nTEM-LegK4 fusion protein, while green fluorescence was still\nemitted when cells were infected with bacteria containing\nTEM-LegK5 fusion. These analyses establish that LegK4, but\nnot LegK5, is translocated into host macrophages during L.\npneumophila infection. When a dotA mutant L. pneumophila\nstrain producing TEM-LegK4 infected macrophages, no\nchange in fluorescence was observed [Fig. 3B, \ufffddotA(TEM-\nLegK4)]. This result demonstrates that translocation of the\nLegK4 protein kinase is Dot/Icm T4SS dependent.\n\nInactivation of legK1 to legK5 genes has no effect on medium\ngrowth neither intracellular life cycle switch of Legionella. To\nidentify the physiological role of Legionella protein kinases,\neach legK gene was separately inactivated, as described in Ma-\nterials and Methods. Genes were partially deleted and re-\nplaced by a unique insertion of a kanamycin cassette\n(legK::kan), verified by PCR and Southern hybridization (data\nnot shown). The five isogenic mutants displayed similar growth\ncharacteristics in liquid medium compared to the parental\nstrain L. pneumophila Lens, and analysis of mutant cell mor-\nphologies by light microscopy did not reveal any major differ-\nences (data not shown).\n\nSuccessful infection of host cells is strictly linked to a precise\ntiming of the life cycle of Legionella, namely, to the switch from\nthe replicative to transmissive bacteria. Intracellular acquired\ntransmissive traits can be mimicked by stationary medium\ngrowth phase (52). To check whether the LegK protein kinases\nare involved in the regulatory processes that control the intra-\ncellular life cycle of Legionella, each legK mutant was assayed\nfor the characteristic trait of the postexponential growth phase,\npigment production (65). The five legK mutants accumulated\npigment during growth, as did the wild-type strain (data not\nshown).\n\nLegK2 protein kinase activity plays a key role in the viru-\nlence of Legionella toward amoeba. In order to assess the vir-\nulence of each legK mutant strain, Acanthamoeba castellanii\namoebae were infected at an MOI of 10 with the wild-type L.\npneumophila Lens or the isogenic legK::kan mutants, and the\nviability of amoeba cells present in infected monolayers at 48 h\npostinfection was quantified by using the Alamar blue dye. The\ncytotoxicity of the legK2 mutant strain toward amoeba, esti-\nmated at 30%, was significantly lower (P \ufffd 0.01) than the value\nof 90% measured for the parental strain. Conversely, legK1,\nlegK3, legK4, and legK5 mutants displayed similar cytotoxicity\ntoward amoebae compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 4A).\n\nTo further evaluate the virulence of each Legionella strain,\nextracellular released bacteria were numbered after one infec-\ntious cycle, i.e., at 24 h postinfection. Compared to the parental\nstrain, 1.5-log fewer bacteria of the mutant strain legK2 (P \ufffd\n0.04) were released from A. castellanii at 24 h postinfection. In\n\nFIG. 3.

Fluorescence data were subjected to background subtractions (uninfected cells).\n\nVOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1943\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\n\n\ncontrast, extracellular bacteria quantified for the legK1, legK3,\nlegK4, and legK5 mutants were similar to the wild-type strain\n(Fig. 4B).\n\nTo check whether the legK2 phenotype is related to a defect\nof bacteria egress or intracellular multiplication, the Lens\nstrain or its legK mutant derivatives expressing the fluorescent\nmCherry protein on a plasmid were used to infect amoebas at\nan MOI of 10. Bacterial intracellular growth was monitored by\nfluorescence measurement during a 66 h-time course (Fig. 4C).\nAs expected, wild-type L. pneumophila started efficient intra-\ncellular growth (an \ufffd40-fold increase in fluorescence) from\n15 h postinfection, whereas the T4SS dotA mutant failed to\nreplicate. The legK1, legK3, legK4, and legK5 mutants showed\nintracellular multiplication from the same time, with the same\nor lightly reduced growth rates compared to Lens strain. On\nthe contrary, legK2 mutant was delayed for intracellular mul-\ntiplication since it started replicating 48 h after infection. After\nthat, its growth rate was not significantly different (P \ufffd 0.02)\nfrom that measured for the wild-type strain.\n\nTo confirm the link between legK2 deletion and the virulence\ndefect observed, complementation experiments were carried\nout. Complementation of the legK2 mutant by introducing a\n\ufffdmobA RSF1010 derivative vector expressing the intact legK2\ngene restored the cytotoxicity and the released extracellular\nbacteria of the parental strain (Fig. 5A and B). Complemen-\ntation assays of the legK2 intracellular multiplication defect\nwere performed by introducing the same vector, producing\nboth the intact LegK2 and the fluorescent mCherry proteins.\nThe intracellular replication kinetics observed for the comple-\nmented legK2 strain was similar to that observed for the Lens\nstrain (Fig. 5C).\n\nTo determine whether the protein kinase activity of LegK2\nis critical for Legionella intracellular multiplication, a substitu-\ntion kinase-dead mutant of LegK2, namely, LegK2(K112M)\ndefective in phosphate donor ATP binding, was generated by\nsite-directed mutagenesis of the legK2 gene cloned on the\nRSF1010 derivative vector. This construct, which stably pro-\nduces the same level of kinase-dead LegK2 compared to the\nwild-type protein (as checked by Western blotting experiments\n[data not shown]), was used to complement the \ufffdlegK2 mutant\ndefects in cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A), extracellular bacteria release\n(Fig. 5B), and intracellular multiplication (Fig. 5C). The sub-\nstitution legK2 mutant is not able to complement the defects of\nthe deletion legK2 mutant strain, suggesting that the protein\nkinase activity of LegK2 plays a key role in the virulence of L.\npneumophila.\n\nThus, L. pneumophila encodes five functional protein ki-\nnases that play a variable role in bacterial virulence toward\namoebae: a nondetectable role for LegK1, LegK3, LegK4, and\nLegK5, but a key role for LegK2. These results suggest that\nLegionella protein kinases are differentially expressed during\nthe Legionella infectious cycle or that they are not functionally\nequal, and they would control various host or bacterial func-\ntions. To answer this question, legK gene expression during the\nexponential and stationary bacterial growth phases, which\nmimic the replicative and transmissive bacterial forms, respec-\ntively, was established by performing real-time quantitative\nPCR experiments. All the five legK genes were expressed in\nlaboratory growth conditions, and expression patterns dis-\nplayed a similar slight downregulation of legK1, legK2, legK3,\n\nand legK4 genes when bacteria entered the postexponential\ngrowth phase (data not shown). Moreover, the legK2 virulence\ndefect was assayed for complementation by vectors expressing\nlegK1, legK3, legK4, or legK5 under the control of the endogenic\npromoter of the legK2 gene. None of these legK genes express-\ning plasmids can reverse the virulence phenotype of legK2\nmutant, as observed with the cytotoxicity of the corresponding\nstrains (Fig. 5A), the extracellular bacteria numeration (Fig.\n5B), and the intracellular replication (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly,\nexpression of these genes even led to an additional loss of\nvirulence. To check whether this observation is restricted to a\nlegK2 genetic background, the same legK genes expressing vec-\ntors were transformed into the wild-type strain Lens. Expres-\nsion of each legK gene on this plasmid resulted in a loss of\nvirulence (data not shown). Further experiments are under way\nto mechanistically examine this result, but we assume that this\neffect most likely results from nonspecific factors, such as the\nelevated expression level of legK genes, which may interfere\nwith the translocation of other T4SS substrates. Taken to-\ngether, these data demonstrate that LegK2 plays a unique role\nin the virulence of L. pneumophila and is not functionally\nredundant with the four tested Legionella protein kinases.\n\nLegK2 protein kinase activity is required for ER recruit-\nment on the LCV. To further characterize the virulence defect\nof legK2 mutant strain, the infectious cycle step altered was\ninvestigated. Intracellular survival at the onset of the A. cas-\ntellanii infection was assessed by counting the viable intracel-\nlular bacteria at 1 h 20 min, 2 h, and 4 h postinfection. The\nlevel of viable intracellular legK2 cells in amoebae corresponds\nto \ufffd10% of the parental strain (P \ufffd 0.02), as early as 1 h 20\npostinfection (Fig. 6A). This result points out the major role of\nthe protein kinase LegK2 in the early steps of the infectious\ncycle of L. pneumophila, namely, in bacterial uptake or in\nbacterial intracellular survival.\n\nBacteria uptake in amoebae was measured by trypan blue\nquenching of fluorescein-labeled L. pneumophila. Wild-type\nstrain or legK2 derivative were fluorescein-labeled and used to\ninfect A. castellanii. After contact, trypan blue was added to\nquench the fluorescence of noninternalized bacteria. Mea-\nsured fluorescence is representative of bacterial uptake, as\ndemonstrated by the effect of the actin polymerization inhibi-\ntor, cytochalasin D (Fig. 6B). The fluorescence of internalized\nlegK2 mutant was similar to that measured for the wild-type\nstrain (Fig. 6B), thus suggesting that LegK2 is not required for\nbacterial uptake but is more likely required for subsequent\ninfectious cycle steps, namely, host cell vesicular trafficking\ncontrol.\n\nThe unique intracellular fate of L. pneumophila involves ER\nrecruitment to the LCV to evade the endocytic pathway and\nreside in a specialized vacuole, allowing intracellular replica-\ntion. Recruitment of the ER by L. pneumophila was observed\nin the model amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum expressing the\nspecific marker of ER, namely, calnexin fused to the GFP.\nAmoebae were infected at an MOI of 100 with wild-type or\nlegK2 mutant strains that express the red fluorescent protein\n(mCherry), and calnexin-positive LCVs were visually scored by\nconfocal microscopy at 1 and 4 h postinfection. In D. discoi-\ndeum infected with the parental Legionella strain Lens, ca. 70%\nof the LCVs stained positive for calnexin-GFP as early as 1 h\nafter infection.

Together, these results indicate\nthat in the absence of LegK2, ER is recruited to LCVs less\nefficiently. To identify whether the protein kinase activity of\nLegK2 is involved in ER recruitment, complementation assays\nof the deleted legK2 mutant defect were performed with the\nsubstitution mutant legK2(K112M)-expressing vector. About\n11% of the legK2(plegK2K112M) mutant-containing vacuoles\nwere stained with the ER marker calnexin at 1 and 4 h postin-\nfection, which is very similar to that observed for the legK2\nmutant (Fig. 6C). The lack of complementation by the legK2\ncatalytic mutant points out the major role of LegK2 protein\nkinase activity in ER recruitment on the LCV.\n\nTo determine whether LegK2 anchors to the phagosomal\nmembrane to recruit ER on the LCV, cellular localization of\nLegK2 during infection was investigated. Legionella cells pro-\nducing the hybrid protein GFP-LegK2 were used to infect\namoeba cells, and cellular localization of the hybrid protein\nwas observed by confocal microscopy. Despite a good level of\ngfp-legK2 expression in bacteria, we could not detect GFP-\nLegK2 protein either in the host cell cytoplasm or on the LCV,\nprobably due to a low level of translocation into host cells (data\nnot shown). To circumvent this difficulty, a strain of the\namoeba D. discoideum that ectopically produces the C-termi-\nnal c-Myc-tagged LegK2(K112M) protein was constructed. Ec-\ntopic expression of the catalytic legK2 mutant, rather than the\nwild-type legK2 strain, was preferred to avoid possible aspecific\neffects of an active protein kinase overproduction on the\namoeba physiology and to facilitate stable binding of LegK2\nto its putative host cell interactants (35, 58), which may be\ncrucial for LegK2 localization. Immunofluorescence obser-\nvations suggested a diffused host cell cytoplasm localization\nof LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc (Fig. 6D). To determine whether\nthe localization of LegK2(K112M) could be dependent on\nother T4SS effectors, localization of LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc\nwas investigated during infection of amoebae by a \ufffdlegK2\nstrain of L. pneumophila. Interestingly, infection triggered\nthe localization of LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc into the plasma\nmembrane (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, the same observation was\nmade by incubating amoebae with Escherichia coli, suggest-\ning that localization of LegK2(K112M) to the plasma mem-\nbrane may be dependent on bacterial phagocytosis rather\nthan on T4SS effector translocation and efficient Legionella\ninfection (Fig. 6D). Thus, when LegK2 is ectopically over-\nproduced in amoebae, it is associated with the plasma mem-\nbrane but not with the phagosomal membrane.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe genomes of the five sequenced L. pneumophila strains\nare characterized by an unusual abundance of eucaryote-like\nproteins encoding genes; among them four protein kinases\nencoding genes have been identified (8). Our extensive in silico\nanalysis of the epidemic strain Lens genome identified one\nmore protein kinase encoding gene, namely, legK5 gene. It is\nnoteworthy that legK5 is specific to this strain. Interestingly, the\nLegK5 protein is homologous (50.99% identity) to a protein\n(UniprotKB entry number C6N1E1) from the strictly intracel-\nlular amoebal pathogen Legionella drancourtii (42). Moreover,\nlpl2477, located immediately downstream legK5, encodes a\n\nprotein that displays 27% identity with an uncharacterized\nprotein (UniProtKB entry number Q1RJU6) from Rickettsia\nbelii, another intracellular bacteria that infects amoebae. Fi-\nnally, the GC content of the legK5 genomic region and the\noccurrence of a transposase-encoding gene strongly suggest\nthat legK5 has been acquired by a small insertion event asso-\nciated with horizontal transfer during co-evolution with other\nbacteria in amoebae; it might represent a new instance of\ngenomic recombination in amoebae, which have been consid-\nered a gene melting pot for evolution in a recent review (50).\nMultiple sequence comparisons of the kinase domains of\nLegK1 to LegK5 with eukaryotic and procaryotic protein ki-\nnase domains revealed that LegK1 and LegK3 cluster in the\ngroup of eukaryotic protein kinases, close to protein kinases\nfrom protozoa (data not shown), as previously reported (8, 46).\nThis observation raises the possibility of their initial acquisition\nby L. pneumophila from the distant eukaryotic organisms that\nare natural hosts for Legionella. In contrast, LegK2, LegK4,\nand LegK5 are not closely similar to eukaryotic protein kinases\nor prokaryotic enzymes. It is noteworthy that protein kinases\nhave been identified in intracellular bacteria such as Mycobac-\nterium tuberculosis (1, 9) and nonpathogenic species such as\nMyxococcus xanthus and Anabaena cyanobacteria (47, 57, 74).\nThe occurrence of protein kinase-encoding genes in free non-\npathogenic bacterial species and in-depth analysis of GC content\nof various protein kinase encoding genes led researchers previ-\nously to conclude that bacterial protein kinases (\u201ceukaryote-like\u201d)\nexisted before the divergence between eukaryotes and pro-\nkaryotes during evolution (27). Thus, even though the presence of\nhorizontally acquired eukaryotic genes in amoeba pathogens such\nas L. pneumophila appears increasingly evident, the precise origin\nof protein kinase-encoding genes in L. pneumophila genomes has\nnot been completely deciphered.\n\nThe eukaryotic kinase family is characterized by 11 con-\nserved sequences, described as the Hanks subdomains, which\nare involved in ATP binding, and in phosphorylation reaction.\nLegK2 and LegK5 lack the Hanks subdomain VIII required for\nsubstrate recognition and phosphotransfer. However, both\nLegK2 and LegK5 are able to autophosphorylate and phos-\nphorylate the eukaryotic protein kinase substrate myelin basic\nprotein (MBP). More than 600 bacterial protein kinases have\nbeen identified through genome sequencing projects and ho-\nmology-based comparisons with eukaryotic kinases and, less\nfrequently, through direct experimental evidence (38, 39).\nGenerally, protein kinases from bacteria conserve the nucleo-\ntide binding region (subdomains I to III) and the core catalytic\ndomain (subdomain VII known as Brenner\u2019s motif H-X-D-\nX4-N [6]), but some of them display less homology as con-\nserved enzymatic activity; for instance, SteC, which is required\nfor host cell actin remodeling by Salmonella, is a functional\nprotein kinase that exhibits only subdomains I to III involved in\nATP binding (59). Moreover, although YihE from E. coli\nclearly possesses protein kinase activity, sequence analysis re-\nveals little similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases, whereas\ntridimensional structure analysis reveals a kinase-like fold sim-\nilar to that of choline kinase and aminoglycoside phospho-\ntransferase (75). Likewise but to a lesser extent, LegK2 and\nLegK5 are functional in terms of phosphorylation even though\nthey do not display all of the consensus domains of the eukary-\notic protein kinase family. In contrast, LegK1 was not in vitro\n\nVOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1947\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\n\n\nlabeled by autophosphorylation and could not phosphorylate\nthe MBP in standard in vitro assay conditions. It can be hy-\npothesized that LegK1 must be activated to be functional.\nIndeed, it was previously shown that YpkA from Y. pestis is\nproduced as an inactive protein kinase. This essential virulence\nfactor is then translocated by a T3SS into the host cell, where\nit is activated by the host cell actin (33). On the other hand, we\ncan assume that LegK1 cannot use the MBP as substrate but\ncould phosphorylate other specific protein substrates. Indeed,\nit has been recently reported that LegK1 can specifically phos-\nphorylate in vitro the eukaryotic I\ufffdB\r protein but not MBP in\ncells, thus activating the NF-\ufffdB pathway (25).\n\nThe bacterial protein kinases LegK1 to LegK4 are translo-\ncated into the host cell cytoplasm by the Dot/Icm T4SS during\ninfection of L. pneumophila. Conversely, LegK5 appeared not\nto be translocated. It is noteworthy that another intracellular\npathogen, M. tuberculosis, encodes 11 different protein kinases,\namong them one that is translocated into the host cell to\nsubvert the host cell defenses (70, 71), while others are tailored\nfor bacterial signal transduction pathways (1, 51). Likewise,\nLegK5 may be involved in bacterial transduction signaling\npathways that control Legionella metabolism rather than in the\ncontrol of host cell functions.\n\nInterestingly, inactivation and/or kinase-dead substitution of\nthe legK2 gene resulted in a significant decrease in the viru-\nlence of L. pneumophila toward amoebae. It is noteworthy that\nT4SS effectors mutants are usually not altered in Legionella\nvirulence, probably due to the high redundancy of these effec-\ntors genes (22). The legK2 mutant virulence defect is not com-\nplemented by other legK gene expression vectors, thus showing\na unique and key role for the LegK2 protein kinase in the\ncontrol of the infectious cycle of L. pneumophila. Although\nthe four other LegK proteins did not interfere individually with\nthe overall ability of Legionella to replicate in the host, they\nmight modulate subtle pathways of Legionella infectivity and/or\nhave complementary or redundant cellular and functional tar-\ngets. Indeed, although LegK1 has been reported to activate the\nNF-\ufffdB pathway and likely plays an important role in modulat-\ning macrophages defenses during L. pneumophila infection,\ndeletion of the legK1 gene has no notable effects on its intra-\ncellular replication (25, 45).\n\nThe legK2 mutant strain is defective for recruiting the ER to\nthe LCV, which results in delayed bacterial intracellular rep-\nlication. Remodeling its phagosome by the recruitment of ER\nis a characteristic trait of the unique intracellular fate of L.\npneumophila to evade the endocytic pathway (11, 34). Inter-\nestingly, two other Dot/Icm substrates, namely, SidC and SidJ,\nwhich do not display any homology with protein kinases, have\nbeen recently shown to be involved in ER recruitment (43, 62).\nMutation in sidJ results in a phenotype very similar to that of\nthe legK2 mutation, i.e., a sidJ mutant is considerably delayed\nin both ER recruitment on the LCV and intracellular growth.\nMoreover, SidJ was not associated with the phagosomal mem-\nbrane. These results led researchers to conclude that SidJ\nmodulates as-yet-unknown host cellular pathways to control\nthe trafficking or the retention of ER-derived vesicles to the\nLCV (43). It would be interesting to determine whether SidJ\nand LegK2 function synergistically and target the same or\nparallel pathways. On the other hand, SidC is an L. pneumo-\nphila effector protein that anchors to the host cell lipid phos-\n\nphatidylinositol-4 phosphate and could act as a \u201ctethering do-\nmain\u201d for ER vesicle recruitment to the LCV (62). Indeed, as\nwith sidJ and legK2 mutants, an LCV harboring the sidC mu-\ntant recruits ER less efficiently than does the wild type. How-\never, sidC mutant replicates at the same rate as the wild type,\nwhile localizing in calnexin-negative LCVs, thus indicating that\nthe interaction with the ER might not be a prerequisite to form\na L. pneumophila replication-permissive compartment. In a\nsimilar manner, ralF and drrA mutants replicate normally de-\nspite an inability to recruit the host GTPase ER-Golgi regula-\ntors Rab1 and Arf1 to the LCV, respectively (49, 54). This\nindicates that L. pneumophila simultaneously targets multiple\nand yet unknown functionally redundant pathways to contrib-\nute to the formation of replication-permissive LCVs, leading to\nthe absence of a phenotype when any single pathway is dis-\nrupted. If we consider that a kinase-dead legK2 mutant is\naltered both in ER recruitment and in intracellular Legionella\nreplication, it can be proposed that the LegK2 protein kinase\nplays a key role for modulating one or several of the host cell\nsignal transduction pathways that contribute to the formation\nof the LCV. Interestingly, this result highlights a new molec-\nular mechanism, namely, protein phosphorylation, developed\nby L. pneumophila to subvert host cell defenses. The relation-\nship between protein phosphorylation and virulence of L.\npneumophila will be investigated further by characterizing the\nhost cell pathways controlled by LegK2. Indeed, deciphering\nthe individual contribution of each Legionella effector to the\nintracellular lifestyle of the bacteria remains a major and per-\nhaps the principal challenge to understanding the molecular\nbasis of Legionella virulence.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was supported by the PEPS program from the Centre\nNational de la Recherche Scientifique and the Universite\u0301 Lyon 1.

Reddy, Nabil A. M. Bin Omar,\n\nSurya S. Singh*\n\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Osmania University, Hyderabad, A.P., India\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Profilins are actin-modulating proteins regulating many intracellular functions based on their multiple and\ndiverse ligand interactions. They have been implicated to play a role in many pathological conditions such as allergies,\ncardiovascular diseases, muscular atrophy, diabetes, dementia and cancer. Post-translational modifications of profilin 1 can\nalter its properties and subsequently its function in a cell. In the present study, we identify the importance of\nphosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 (S137) residue in breast cancer progression.\n\nMethods/Principal Findings: We found elevated profilin 1 (PFN) in human breast cancer tissues when compared to\nadjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of wild-type profilin 1 (PFN-WT) in breast cancer MCF7 cells made them more\nmigratory, invasive and adherent independent in comparison to empty vector transfected cells. Mutation in serine\nphosphorylation site (S137) of profilin 1 (PFN-S137A) significantly abrogated these properties. Mutation affecting actin-\nbinding ability (PFN-R74E) of profilin 1 enhanced its tumorigenic function whereas mutation affecting its poly-L-proline\nbinding function (PFN-H133S) alleviated these mechanisms in breast cancer cells. PFN-WT was found to activate matrix\nmetalloproteinases by zymography, MMP2 and MMP9 in presence of PDBu (phorbol 12, 13 dibutyrate, PI3K agonist) to\nenhance migration and invasion in MCF7 cells while PFN-S137A did not. Phosphorylation increased migration and invasion\nin other mutants of profilin 1. Nuclear profilin levels also increased in the presence of PDBu.\n\nConclusions: Previous studies show that profilin could be executing a dual role in cancer by either suppressing or\npromoting tumorigenesis in a context dependent manner. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that\nphosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 enhances oncogenic properties in breast cancer cells. Inhibitors targeting profilin\n1 phosphorylation directly or indirectly through inhibition of kinases that phosphorylate profilin could be valuable\ntherapeutic agents that can alter its activity and thereby control the progression of cancer.\n\nCitation: Rizwani W, Fasim A, Sharma D, Reddy DJ, Bin Omar NAM, et al.

Early detection and treatment is\n\nprolonging life expectancy in breast cancer patients. Mortality due\n\nto breast cancer has decreased significantly in the past decade;\n\nhowever, many patients die due to disease relapse and metastasis.\n\nWhile many nonmetastatic breast tumors are initially hormone\n\ndependent, most acquire hormonal autonomy at later stages to\n\nbecome metastatic [2]. Cell migration and invasion are important\n\nsteps towards breast cancer progression and metastasis that require\n\ndynamic cytoskeletal and cell membrane rearrangement for cell\n\nmotility. Profilin (PFN), an actin modulating protein, is an\n\nabundant cytoskeletal protein and widely distributed in eukaryotic\n\ncells [3]. Profilin and its isoforms are considered to be important\n\nregulators of the actin-based cytoskeleton. Under in vitro condi-\ntions, profilin in high amounts inhibits actin polymerization by\n\nsequestering actin monomer from F-actin or, inversely when\n\npresent in low amounts promotes actin polymerization in\n\nappropriate circumstances [4\u20136]. It has been shown that profilin\n\n1 promotes membrane protrusion, cell migration and invasion\n\nwhile profilin 2 suppresses these processes in breast cancer [7]. Its\n\ninteraction with PI(4,5)P2 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate),\n\na component of the phosphatidylinositol cycle, serves as a link\n\nthrough which the signaling pathways communicate with the\n\ndynamics of the actin cytoskeleton [8,9]. Post-translational\n\nmodifications (PTM), such as nitration and phosphorylation, of\n\nprofilin 1 have biological implications [10\u201312]. Phosphorylation at\n\nserine residue (S137) allows it to interact with greater affinity to\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nwww.cdc.gov\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0103868&domain=pdf\n\n\nactin and proline rich proteins such as p85a, the regulatory\nsubunit of PI3K (Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase), a lipid kinase with\n\ntumor promoting activity [12]. It is increasingly evident that\n\nprofilin is associated with important signaling proteins known to be\n\ninvolved in transformation, such as PI3K (apoptosis) and Protein\n\nKinase C (PKC) (tumorigenicity) [13,14]. However, the role of\n\nserine phosphorylation of profilin in cancer remains to be\n\nexplored.\n\nProfilin 1 has been extensively studied in breast cancer cell lines\n\nand mouse models for breast cancer [14\u201316]. Immunohistochem-\n\nical analysis of human breast cancers revealed intermediate to low\n\nlevels of profilin 1 expression [16]. Differential expression of\n\nprofilin was reported in different cancers suggesting the complexity\n\nin the role of profilin in cancer [17,18]. Studies supporting its role\n\nin cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancer\n\ndiffered suggesting a dichotomous role for profilin 1 in breast\n\ncancer progression thereby necessitating further studies in this\n\narea. Among its different ligands, it is reported that profilin\u2019s\n\nfunction as a tumor suppressor depends on its actin binding ability\n\n[17]. Our present data on human breast cancer tissues from\n\nIndian population revealed enhanced expression of profilin 1\n\nwhen compared to adjacent normal tissues of the breast. Previous\n\ndata from our lab demonstrated that phosphoprofilin (S137) binds\n\nto actin monomers with higher affinity and therefore might alter\n\nactin polymerization. Any change in actin polymerization affects\n\ncell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. A recent study\n\ndemonstrated similar effects due to phosphorylation of profilin at\n\ntyrosine Y129 and its potential role in facilitating adult angiogen-\n\nesis in tissue wound healing [10]. Phosphoprofilin (pY129) also\n\nfacilitated glioblastoma progression by endothelial secretion of\n\nangiocrine factors that induced hypoxia inducible factor 1a\n(HIF1a) stabilization and accumulation in normoxic conditions\n[19]. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137\n\ncould be crucial in breast cancer progression. Studies presented\n\nhere demonstrate that S137 phosphorylation of profilin 1 not only\n\naugment migration and invasion in breast cancer cells (MCF7) but\n\nalso enable them to become anchorage independent. Other\n\nmutations in profilin 1 that hinder profilin\u2019s interactions with actin\n\nor poly-L-proline (PLP) containing proteins demonstrated en-\n\nhanced tumorigenic properties indicating the significance of\n\nserine phosphorylation of profilin in cancer progression and the\n\npotential in making pS137 a chemotherapeutic target to curb\n\nbreast cancer.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nSubjects\nPrimary, non-invasive and invasive breast carcinomas following\n\nradical mastectomy at different tumor stages (T1-4N0-1M0) of\n\nfemale human subjects (27 ductal carcinoma and 3 lobular\n\ncarcinoma cases) belonging to varying age groups from 40\u201370\n\nyears were used for the study. Normal tissue adjacent to the tumor\n\nfrom the same breast was used as control. The nature of the tissue\n\nwas confirmed by histopathological studies. Prior written consent\n\nfrom patients was obtained before tissue samples were collected\n\nfollowing mastectomy and the samples were not exclusively used\n\nfor this study and not meant for commercial use. The study and\n\nthe method of tissue collection were approved by the \u2018\u2018Institutional\n\nEthics Committee for Biomedical Research\u2019\u2019, Hyderabad, India\n\nand Osmania University.\n\nCollection and processing of breast tissue samples\nAfter surgical resection (mastectomy), samples were collected in\n\nice-cold Tris- buffered saline (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2 and 0.9%\n\nNaCl) and immediately processed for future analysis. Tissues were\n\nground in Remi homogenizer on ice in tissue lysis buffer (40 mM\n\nTris buffer, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM b-\nME, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 130 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF,\n\n1 mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at\n\n160006g for 20 min at 4uC. The supernatant obtained was used\nfor western blotting analyses.\n\nIsolation of primary epithelial cells from breast tissue\n1 g of breast tissue (tumor and normal) derived after mastec-\n\ntomy was cut up manually into small pieces, approximately 0.5 cm\n\ncubed, collected and washed in ice-cold Kreb\u2019s Ringer buffer\n\n(116 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.6 mM\n\nNaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 22 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose,\n\npH 7.4). The tissue was digested overnight at 37uC in a shaking\nincubator at 50 rpm with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (Type IV, sigma)\n\nin 5 ml RPMI medium (RPMI 1640 media containing 2 mM L-\n\nglutamine, 100U of penicillin/ml, 100 mg streptomycin/ml and\n10% fetal calf serum). Following enzyme digestion, the fat layer\n\nwas decanted by centrifuging at 10006g for 5 min at room\ntemperature (RT) and washed several times with the buffer. The\n\ncell-rich supernatant was backflushed through 60 m and 50 m\nmeshes to isolate breast organoids from red blood cells, fibroblasts\n\nand endothelial cells. The cells were disaggregated by pipetting in\n\nmedia containing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA followed by filtration\n\nthrough 40 m meshes. The cell pellet was collected and washed\nthree more times to yield a predominantly single cell suspension\n\n[20]. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml media and the\n\ncells were counted on cytometer after trypan blue staining. The\n\ncells were lysed in M2 lysis buffer (20 mM tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% NP-\n\n40, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EGTA, 3 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaF,\n\n5 mM Na3VO4 and 5 mg/ml protease inhibitor cocktail) and\nthe lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 120006g for 15 min at\n4uC.\n\nCell Culture\nMCF7 cells were purchased from NCCS (National Center for\n\nCell Science), Pune, India (previously published in [21]). MCF7\n\ncells were grown in MEM supplemented with 0.01 mg/ml Insulin,\n\n10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.\n\nMCF7 cells transfected with profilin 1 and mutants were\n\nmaintained in the above media supplemented with 800 mg/ml\nG418. Insulin and G418 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,\n\nUSA.\n\nWestern blot analyses\nTotal protein in clear supernatants obtained from breast tissue\n\nand cell lysates was estimated by Bradford\u2019s method according to\n\nthe manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). 50 mg protein from\ntissue lysates and cell lysates was subjected to 10% tricine SDS-\n\nPAGE [22] and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The\n\nmembrane was blocked with 3% gelatin in TTBS buffer (10 mM\n\nTris, 154 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5) for 1 hr, then\n\nwashed with TTBS (4610 ml) and incubated with rabbit anti-\nprofilin 1 antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Novus biologicals) or rabbit\n\nanti-PKCf antibodies (1:500, in-house) and anti-actin antibodies\n(1:3000, Sigma) for 2 hr. After washings with TTBS, the blot was\n\nincubated with horse radish peroxidase conjugated secondary anti-\n\nrabbit/anti-mouse goat IgG for 2 hr. The blot was then\n\ncolorimetrically developed using NBT/BCIP (Amersham Phar-\n\nmacia Biotech).\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

GST clones\n\nof profilin-1 WT, R74E and H133S (characterized by [23,24]\n\nwere subcloned into EGFP-C1 vector using forward primer: 59-\n\nAGC CAA GCT AGT GCC GGG TGG AAC GCC- 39 and\n\nreverse primer: 59- CAG GGA TCC TCA GTA CTG GGA ACG\n\nCCG AAG-39. Similarly, S137A from pcDNA3 construct [25] was\n\nsubcloned into EGFP-C1 vector. All inserts were cloned between\n\nHindIII and BamH1 restriction sites (forward primer: 59- CCA\n\nAGC TTC GAT GGC CGG GTG GAA CG-39 and reverse\n\nprimer: 59- GCGGATCC CTA GTA CTG GGC ACG CCG A-\n\n39). All the constructs including empty vector (eGFP-N1) were\n\nconfirmed by plasmid sequencing (Invitrogen). These constructs\n\nwere then overexpressed by transfection in MCF7 cells.\n\nTransfection and generation of cell lines\nMCF7 cells were transfected with a control EGFP-N1 vector or\n\nfollowing profilin1 expressing constructs: GFP-PFN1-WT (Wild-\n\nType, human), GFP-PFN1-S137A (serine 137 phosphorylation\n\nmutant), GFP-PFN1-R74E (actin mutant) or GFP-PFN1-H133S\n\n(PLP binding mutant). For transfection, 0.5 mg plasmid DNA was\nmixed along with 1 ml of transfection reagent (chloroform:DT-\nDEAC lipid micelles made in laboratory) [26] in a total volume of\n\n200 ml serum-free MEM media. The transfection mix was\nincubated at room temperature for 30 min, following which it\n\nwas added to 20,000 MCF7 cells pre-incubated in serum-free\n\nMEM media for 1 hr. After 5 hr of transfection, media was\n\nchanged to complete MEM media and cells were allowed to grow\n\nfor 24 hr for protein expression. Selection media with 800 mg/ml\nG418 was added and polyclonal populations were selected over a\n\nperiod of two weeks.\n\nCell Viability Assay\nTo determine cell growth of transfected clones, 2000 cells of\n\neach clone were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and cell\n\nviability was assessed by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]- 2,5-\n\ndiphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay at 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr and\n\n7days. MTT reagent (diluted from a 4 mg/ml solution in PBS) was\n\nadded to all the wells at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml and\n\nthe cells were further incubated for 4 hr at 37uC. The reaction was\nterminated by adding 200 ml/well dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and\nabsorbance was read at 570 nm in an ELISA plate reader. Wells\n\ncontaining complete media alone was used as blank and the\n\naverage values subtracted from the average values of all clones.\n\nThe assay was repeated three times and analyzed using two-sided\n\nStudent\u2019s t test. Data points represent the mean6s.d and p,0.005\nwas considered significant.\n\nSoft agar growth assay\nAnchorage independent growth was assayed by the soft agar\n\ngrowth assay as described elsewhere [27]. The first step involved\n\nplating a bottom layer of 0.6% agar in serum-free media in 12-well\n\nplates. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min\n\nto solidify the agar. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and\n\n16104 cells were mixed with 0.3% agarose (made in complete\nmedia) and layered carefully on the top of existing 0.6% agarose.\n\nThe plates were covered with 1 ml of medium supplemented with\n\n10% FBS and incubated at 37uC in a 5% CO2 incubator for\n10days. Complete media was added every 2 days to the test wells.\n\nAt the end of 10days, cell colonies with .100 mm in diameter\nwere imaged and counted under a microscopic field at 2.56\nmagnification. Mean colony count was based on numbers from 5\n\ndifferent fields imaged under 2.56 magnification from two\nindependent experiments done in duplicate for each treatment\n\ncondition and was analyzed using two-sided Student\u2019s t test.\n\nWound healing assay\n56104 cells were plated in a 6-well plate in triplicate and\n\nallowed to grow to confluency. Cells were washed and left in\n\nserum-free media for 5 hr. A scratch was made and media was\n\nadded that was either only serum-free or with 200 nM PDBu\n\n(phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) or with 20 mM LY294002/200 nM\nPDBu. Images were captured at 106 magnification using Leica\nMicroscope at zero hour and again at 24 hr. The scratch area at\n\nzero hour and empty area not covered by migrated cells after\n\n24 hr was analyzed with ImagePro software. The assay was\n\nrepeated three times. Data points represent the mean6s.d. from\n\nfive fields of uncovered scratch area from three independent\n\nexperiments and p,0.05 was considered significant.\n\nCell Invasion assay\nInvasion assay was performed as per the protocol published by\n\nDasgupta et al [27]. MCF7 overexpressing profilin 1 and its\n\nmutant clones were harvested by trypsinization and 16105 cells\nwere placed in the top chamber of boyden filters as untreated/\n\ntreated with 200 nM PDBu or a combination of 20 mM LY294002\nand 200 nM PDBu in serum-free media. The filters were pre-\n\ncoated with 100 mg/ml ECM (BD Biosciences) and incubated for\n4 hr at 37uC before adding cells and the assay was performed\naccording to the protocol [27]. Invaded cells were stained with\n\nhematoxylin and images for 6 different fields per treatment were\n\ncaptured using 406magnification using a Leica microscope. The\nassay was repeated twice in duplicate and analyzed using two-\n\nsided Student\u2019s t test. Data points represent the mean6s.d. and\np,0.05 was considered significant.\n\nFlow cytometry\nAsynchronously growing MCF7 clones overexpressing profilin\n\nand its mutants were treated with hypotonic buffer (1 mg/ml\n\nsodium citrate and 0.3% Igepal) for 20 min. The buffer digests the\n\ncytoplasm and nuclei detach from the plate. Nuclei are gently\n\npipetted a few times and collected in an eppendorf for Green\n\nFluorescence acquisition [28]. Similarly, 105 cells of each clone\n\nwere plated and serum starved for 24 hr. Cells were then treated\n\nwith DMSO control/200 nM PDBu/a combination of 20 mM\nLY294002 and 200 nM PDBu for 24 hr.

Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo\n\nsoftware.\n\nResults\n\nHuman breast cancer tissues and primary cells derived\nfrom them express high levels of profilin 1\n\nPublished results on levels of profilin in different cancer tissues/cell\n\nlines are contradictory. Western blotting analyses was performed on\n\nlysates prepared from patient samples for breast cancer and adjacent\n\nnormal breast tissues. Profilin 1 levels were significantly higher in\n\nbreast cancer tissues compared to their adjacent normal counterparts\n\n(Figure 1A). Densitometric analysis of the western blots revealed\n\nprofilin 1 was 3.662.5-fold (*p,0.01) elevated in cancer tissues\n\n(Figure 1B). Simultaneously, primary epithelial cells were isolated\n\nfrom the same patient samples and lysates were subjected to western\n\nblot analysis for profilin 1. A representative western blot is presented\n\nin Figure 1D and densitometric analysis of the western blots show a\n\n1.660.3- fold (*p,0.03) increase in profilin 1 levels in cells isolated\n\ndirectly from the breast cancer tissues when compared to adjacent\n\nnormal tissues (Figure 1E).\n\nPost-translational modification such as phosphorylation can\n\nalter the function of cytoskeletal-associated proteins in tumorigen-\n\nesis; since profilin 1 is known to undergo phosphorylation at\n\nSer137 preferentially by PKCf, an enzyme with potential role in\nbreast cancer cell chemotaxis and tumor invasion [31\u201333]; we also\n\nexamined PKCf levels by western blotting in breast cancer and\nadjacent normal tissues (Figure 1A, middle panel). Figure 1C is a\n\ndensitometric representation of increased PKCf expression\n(1.660.5-fold, *p,0.05) in breast cancer tissues. Elevated protein\n\nlevels of PKCf in breast cancer tissues were indicative of a\nphosphorylation event targeting profilin 1 too. Therefore, we\n\nstudied the probable role of profilin 1 phosphorylation at serine\n\nresidue (S137) in breast cancer.\n\nOverexpression of profilin 1-wild type and profilin 1\nmutants in breast cancer cell line, MCF7\n\nSince profilin 1 levels were high in patients with breast cancer,\n\nwe overexpressed profilin 1 and some of its mutants in MCF7 cells\n\nto study their effect on cancer progression. MCF7 cells were\n\ntransfected with each of the following vectors individually: EGFP-\n\nN1 (Empty Vector, designated as EV), GFP-Profilin 1-wild type\n\n(PFN-WT), GFP-Profilin 1-S137A (mutant for serine 137 phos-\n\nphorylation site; PFN-S137A), GFP-Profilin 1-R74E (mutant for\n\nactin-binding site, PFN-R74E) and GFP-Profilin 1-H133S (mutant\n\nfor poly-L-proline (PLP) sequence binding, PFN-H133S). Expres-\n\nsion of profilin clones was studied by confocal microscopy. Left\n\npanel depicts images of GFP-Profilin and its mutants, middle panel\n\nshows DAPI images and right panel shows merged images for each\n\nclone (Figure 2). Each clone showed varying localization of GFP-\n\nProfilin. EV expression was observed in the nucleus and\n\ncytoplasm. PFN-WT, PFN-S137A and PFN-H133S showed\n\ncytoplasmic and nuclear expression. Of these, PFN-H133S was\n\npredominantly cytoplasmic and PFN-R74E was mostly nuclear\n\nwith little cytoplasmic expression. These results indicate that\n\ninteraction of profilin with actin is essential to maintain profilin in\n\nthe cytoplasm. PFN-H133S showed the least expression of nuclear\n\nprofilin suggesting that interaction with PLP-containing proteins\n\ncould be essential for its nuclear translocation. Simultaneously,\n\nlysates were prepared from MCF7 cells expressing different clones\n\nof profilin and subjected to western blotting with anti-profilin\n\nantibodies. EV did not show over-expressed profilin whereas all\n\nthe clones showed a band corresponding to GFP-profilin (41 kDa).\n\nEndogenous cellular profilin 1 (14 kDa) was observed in all the\n\nlanes including EV and actin was used as loading control (42 kDa)\n\n(Figure 3A). Next, we determined the nuclear expression alone of\n\nGFP-profilin and mutants in asynchronously growing MCF7 cells\n\nby subjecting them to hypotonic solution that bursts the cytoplasm\n\nbut leaves the nuclei intact and detached from the plate. The\n\nnuclei are collected as a single cell suspension and subjected to flow\n\ncytometric analysis (Figure 3B). Untransfected MCF7 cells were\n\nused to gate the positive nuclei from the clones. All the clones\n\nshowed similar numbers of nuclei that were positive for profilin 1.\n\nFigure 3C\u20133G show the flow cytometry dot plots of GFP-positive\n\nnuclei from asynchronously growing EV (96.1%), PFN-WT\n\n(85.9%), PFN-S137A (92.8%), PFN-R74E (94.6%) and PFN-\n\nH133S (91.3%) respectively. These clones were then selected in\n\nneomycin (G418) to obtain a 100% positive polyclonal population\n\noverexpressing profilin 1 and its mutants respectively.\n\nOverexpression of profilin 1 facilitates cell growth and\nanchorage independent growth that is further enhanced\nby its phosphorylation at Serine137\n\nWe first assessed the growth ability of transfected cells in culture\n\nat 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr and 7days of plating in complete media by\n\nMTT assay (Figure 4A). PFN-WT demonstrated the highest\n\nviability at all time points studied followed by PFN-R74E and\n\nPFN-H133S. PFN-S137A showed the least growth rate and was\n\ncomparable to EV transfected MCF7 cells (***p,0.005). Anchor-\n\nage independency is one of the hallmarks of cancer and this\n\nfeature allows tumor cells to invade adjacent tissues and lead to\n\nmetastasis [34]. To determine which of the profilin 1 mutants\n\nmight interfere with the tumorigenic property of MCF7 cells, soft\n\nagar assay was performed and colonies above 100 mm where\ncounted and plotted. Figure 4B shows representative images of\n\ncolonies in soft agar of different mutants of profilin 1 and\n\nfigure 4C is a graphic representation of the average number of\n\ncolonies for each clone from 5 different fields under 2.56\nmagnification. We observed that MCF7 cells expressing PFN-\n\nWT formed significantly more and larger colonies in soft agar\n\ncompared to EV-expressing MCF7 cells (**p,0.01). PFN-S137A\n\nformed smaller and less number of colonies than EV and 42\n\npercent less number of colonies (***p,0.005) than PFN-WT,\n\nthereby indicating that (S137) phosphorylation of profilin 1\n\nfacilitates anchorage independency in breast cancer cells. Actin\n\nmutant (PFN-R74E) formed 70 percent more colonies (**p,0.01)\n\nthan PFN-WT, consistent with previous reports demonstrating\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Defect in PLP binding ability of PFN (PFN-\n\nH133S) did not allow any colony formation in soft agar, though\n\nthe viability of these cells in monolayer cultures was fairly\n\ncomparable to PFN-R74E till 72 hr and decreasing by 7days.\n\nThese results were in corroboration with Wittenmeyer\u2019s study [17]\n\nreporting the inability of PFN-H133S to form tumors in mice.\n\nPhosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 leads to enhanced\nmigration and invasion\n\nWhether phosphorylation of profilin 1 affects migration and\n\ninvasion of breast cancer cells expressing various profilin 1 mutants\n\nwas next assessed by wound healing assays and boyden chamber\n\nassays respectively. PKCf activity can be reduced by the\npharmacological inhibitors of PI3K. Previous in vivo studies from\nour lab have demonstrated that phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu),\n\na protein kinase C activator (PKC), phosphorylates profilin 1 at\n\nSerine 137 and the effect is reversed by LY294002, an inhibitor of\n\nPI3K and subsequently PKCf [12,35]. We studied their effect on\nprofilin 1 mediated migration and invasion. MCF7 cells overex-\n\npressing profilin 1 and its mutants were grown to confluency and a\n\nscratch was made with a pipet tip. Images were captured at 206\nmagnification of the scratch at zero hour for each treatment. After\n\n24 hr following treatments, images were captured and non-\n\nmigrated area was analyzed. Figure 5 shows representative images\n\nof the wound and migrated cells into the wound for all the clones.\n\nAll clones migrated to some extent into the wound at 24 hr in\n\nserum-free media. PDBu induced significant migration in all\n\nclones but not in the PFN-S137A mutant clone, therefore\n\ndemonstrating that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at Serine 137 is\n\nan important event in promoting migration of MCF7 cells. PFN-\n\nWT and PFN-R74E expressing cells migrate more than EV\n\nexpressing cells upon treatment with PDBu (**p,0.05). Pre-\n\ntreatment of cells with LY294002 significantly abrogated migra-\n\ntion of MCF7 cells overexpressing PFN-WT, PFN-R74E and\n\nPFN-H133S (**p,0.05). PFN-S137A did not show much change\n\nin migration at 24 hr in either serum-free media or PDBu or LY/\n\nPDBu treated cells (***p,0.005) (Figure 6A). This result reinforces\n\nthe fact that serine phosphorylation of profilin 1 facilitates\n\nmigration of breast cancer cells.\n\nSimilarly, invasion assays using ECM (extracellular matrix)\n\ncoated boyden chamber filters revealed that PFN-WT and PFN-\n\nR74E cells invade more than EV cells in the presence and absence\n\nof PDBu. PFN-R74E showed more invasiveness than PFN-WT\n\n(**p,0.05). PFN-H133S invades the least (**p,0.05). However,\n\nPDBu- treated PFN-H133S showed 3 times more invasion when\n\ncompared to serum-free media, indicating that though PFN-\n\nH133S is defective in binding to any PLP containing proteins,\n\nphosphorylation at Ser137 made it more aggressive. Pre-treatment\n\nwith LY249002 inhibits invasion of all clones and in fact the\n\ninvasiveness is reduced further than serum-free media. PFN-\n\nS137A demonstrates significantly reduced invasion even in the\n\npresence of PDBu (**p,0.05) (Figure 6B).\n\nFigure 5.

Studies have also been\n\nreported showing colocalization of profilin with MT1-MMP\n\n(MMP14) at the leading edges of activated monocytes migrating\n\non a layer of activated endothelial cells [37]. MT1-MMP14, in\n\nturn, activates MMP2 and MMP9. In the present study, we make\n\nevident that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 plays a crucial\n\nrole in promoting migration and invasion by activating MMP2\n\nand MMP9. Conditioned media from clones growing in serum-\n\nfree media or 200 nM PDBu containing media were subjected to\n\nzymography to analyze MMP2 and MMP9 activity. We found\n\nthat serum-free clones produce very low MMP2 only, whereas\n\nPDBu-treated cells produced significant amounts of MMP9 and to\n\na certain extent MMP2 also. Among the clones, PFN-WT showed\n\nmaximum MMP2/9 activity. PFN-R74E also expressed increased\n\nMMP9 activity comparable to PFN-WT. PFN-H133S by itself was\n\nnot very migratory and invasive in nature but PDBu-treatment\n\nmakes this clone sufficiently pro-invasive. Consistent with that\n\ndata, we found MMP2/9 activity increasing in this clone in\n\nresponse to PDBu. PFN-S137A had the least MMP2 activity and\n\nremained same under all conditions tested. MMP9 activity in\n\nPFN-S137A was comparable to EV and considerably less than\n\nPFN-WT (Figure 7A).\n\nPhosphorylation increases translocation of a subset of\nprofilin 1 to the nucleus\n\nThough profilin 1 has been shown to be localized partially in\n\nthe nucleus, very few studies are available on its role in the\n\nnucleus. Recent studies carried out in dipteran Chironomas tentans\nhave shown that a fraction of profilin in located in the nucleus; is\n\nhighly concentrated in the nucleoplasm and nuclear periphery. It\n\nassociates with protein-coding transcriptionally active genes and is\n\nindependent of actin [38]. Similarly, we observed PFN-WT and its\n\nmutants to be localized in the nucleus, especially PFN-R74E,\n\nmutant for actin-binding was predominantly nuclear. We also find\n\nthat increasing amounts of profilin localizes to the nucleus upon\n\nphosphorylation by PDBu as early as 5 min and upto 18 hr when\n\nFigure 8. Schematic showing various pathways that triggers PI3K activity in breast cancer. These pathways can potentially lead to\nphosphorylation of profilin 1: (1) Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), (2) Insulin (Ins) and Insulin-like growth factors, (3) Estrogen receptor/Estrogen\ncomplex (ER/E), (4) Growth factors (GF) and (5) Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A) are well known pathways that activate PI3K\n(Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase) and most common to hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancers. PI3K can in turn activate PKC\u2019s\n(Protein Kinase C and its isoforms) including PKCf. Among all PKC isoforms, PKCf preferentially phosphorylates profilin 1 on Serine (S137) residue that\nleads to enhanced tumorigenic properties in breast cancer cells. VEGF-A can also lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of profilin 1 and increases\nangiogenic activity. It can be hypothesized that together these post-translational modifications could be instrumental in breast cancer progression.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103868.g008\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\ncompared to serum starved cells (Figure 7B). PFN-WT showed the\n\nmost nuclear concentrations of profilin 1 when compared to serum\n\nstarved cells. However, PFN-S137A, mutant for phosphorylation\n\nat serine 137, did not show any change in profilin localization with\n\nor without PDBu (Figure 7B). These results suggest that\n\nphosphorylation of profilin is importing profilin into the nucleus\n\nand probably facilitating in the binding of profilin to transcrip-\n\ntionally active genes relative to promoting tumorigenesis. This\n\nobservation will need more confirmatory studies and identification\n\nof nuclear proteins or genes regulated by profilin.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present study, we report elevated profilin 1 expression in\n\nnon-metastatic, primary breast carcinoma tissues from Indian\n\npopulation. Profilin levels have been found to be elevated in some\n\npathological states such as adipose tissue inflammation, liver and\n\nkidney diseases [39\u201341] though in cancers the reports have been\n\nambiguous. Profilin 1 was found to be downregulated in breast\n\ncancer cells CAL51 [16], in pancreatic cancer [42], and in\n\nhepatocarcinoma tissues [43] and upregulated in gastric cancer\n\n[44]. Analysis of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cell line for differenti-\n\nation related cytoskeletal proteins also indicated profilin 2 to be\n\nelevated in expression [45]. Profilin 1 was identified as a secreted\n\nprotein from tumor masses at progressive stage in skin fibromas\n\n[46], in oral cancer saliva proteome [47] and also in pancreatic\n\ncancer secretome [42]. Whether elevated profilin 1 levels alone are\n\nindicative of increased motility and aggressive cancers is debatable.\n\nVarious cell lines from different cancers behaved differently with\n\noverexpression or abrogation of profilin 1 with respect to cell\n\nmigration, invasion and proliferation [16,18,48,49]. Recent studies\n\nreport that profilin 1 is a potential biomarker for bladder cancer\n\naggressiveness and suppressing its expression in T24 bladder\n\ncancer cell line decreased their motility with a concomitant\n\ndecrease in actin polymerization [18]. Breast cancer MDA-MB-\n\n231 cells showed reduced migration upon overexpression of\n\nprofilin 1 [48], however, an in depth analysis carried out by\n\nsilencing profilin 1 showed suppressed endothelial cell prolifera-\n\ntion, migration and cord morphogenesis [50]. Likewise studies\n\ninvolving upregulation of profilin showed increased invasiveness\n\nand growth of smooth muscle cells [51] and also resulted in\n\nglomerular cell proliferation [41]. These observations support the\n\nnotion that profilin is directly associated with cell motility,\n\nmigration and proliferation. Hence the need to investigate the\n\ndifferent aspects that regulate profilin\u2019s function in breast\n\ntumorigenesis and cancer progression.\n\nEarlier studies indicate profilin 19s involvement in cell motility\n\nin the intracellular movement of pathogenic organisms [52] and\n\nmigration of lower eukaryotic organisms such as Dictyostelium and\nListeria [53,54]. It is known that the profilin-actin complex is\nrecruited at the barbed end of actin filaments at the protruding\n\nend of lamellipodia in migrating cells where actin polymerization\n\nis initiated. Impaired motility of intracellular pathogens was\n\nobserved in profilin-deletion experiments and revealed the\n\nimportance of profilin in bacterial motility [52], in migration\n\nand proliferation of lower eukaryotes [53]. Profilin-deficient mice\n\nwere embryonically lethal and profilin 1 null mice embryos did not\n\nsurvive indicating its necessity in cell division and survival during\n\nembryogenesis [55]. Profilins assist F-actin elongation at the\n\nleading edge of migrating cells through their interactions with a\n\nhost of actin-binding proteins like Ena (enabled)/VASP (vasodi-\n\nlator stimulated phosphoprotein) [56,57]. Profilin 1 and profilin 2\n\nprotein ratios in a cell can also determine the extent of actin\n\npolymerization and cellular motility [7]. Previously known facts\n\ninclude that both actin and polyproline interactions of profilin 1\n\nare essential for tumorigenesis and enhanced migration/invasion\n\n[17,36]. Studies published recently report that phosphorylation of\n\nprofilin at tyrosine 129 in endothelial cells facilitates secretion of\n\nangiocrine factors. These, in turn, stabilize HIF-1a in a hypoxia-\nindependent manner to promote glioblastoma progression [19].\n\nThrough our studies, we add a new dimension to the role of\n\nprofilin in cell motility, invasion and aggressiveness. Phosphory-\n\nlation at Ser137 of profilin 1 confers enhanced motility to MCF7\n\ncells by itself irrespective of its actin binding or (PLP) protein\n\nbinding capabilities.\n\nDynamics of profilin\u2019s interactions with its ligands, including\n\nactin polymerization changes upon PTM such as nitration and\n\nphosphorylation [12,58]. A number of signaling pathways\n\ntriggered by external factors such as hormones (estrogen) (reviewed\n\nin [59]), growth factors (Insulin, Insulin-like growth factors) [60],\n\nradiation [61] activate PI3K which is known to activate PKC\u2019s\n\nincluding the atypical PKCf and therefore could possibly lead to\nphosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 (Figure 8). Whether all these\n\npathways eventually culminate to phosphorylate profilin 1 needs\n\nfurther investigation but a probable regulatory loop might be\n\nexisting wherein profilin 1 activates PI3K [62] through its\n\nassociation with p85a subunit [63] which in turn increases the\nproduction of D3 phosphoinositides like PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) known\n\nto activate PKC\u2019s and Akt pathway. PKC\u2019s trigger survival,\n\nmotility and breast cancer progression (reviewed in [64]). We\n\nfound PKC elevated in the breast cancer samples and another\n\nstudy found increased PI3K levels in breast cancers [65] indicating\n\nthat profilin 1 phosphorylation could be an obligatory signaling\n\nevent in promoting breast tumorigenesis. ROCK (Rho-associated\n\nKinase) and PP1 (Protein phosphatase 1) are also known to\n\nregulate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of profilin 1 at\n\nSer137 [25]. Multiple kinases affect profilin phosphorylation\n\nthereby increasing the complexity in the nature of profilin 19s\n\nfunction; its interactions with its many isoforms and oligomers\n\n[35]. These in turn will affect the cascade of protein\n\ninteractions further and the biological consequences thereafter.\n\nFrom our studies in breast cancer cells using serine phosphor-\n\nylation mutant of profilin (PFN-S137A), it is evident that\n\nprofilin phosphorylation is crucial in promoting tumorigenesis.\n\nPFN-S137A overexpressing cells also showed significantly\n\nreduced growth, migration, invasion and colony formation\n\ncompared to PFN-WT.\n\nMMP9-mediated gelatin matrix degradation showed substan-\n\ntially higher expression in PDBu-stimulated breast cancer cells\n\nexpressing PFN and its mutants studied. MMP2-mediated gelatin\n\ndegradation was relatively lower than MMP9 in PDBu-stimulated\n\ncells. MT1-MMP (MMP14) has been shown to colocalize with\n\nprofilin in monocytes at leading edges [37]. It is well known that\n\nMT1-MMP self-activates and in turn activates MMP2 and MMP9\n\nalso. Together these are involved in degrading extracellular matrix\n\nand making cells more motile and invasive. PFN-S137A express-\n\ning cells demonstrated least activity of MMP9 and MMP2 thereby\n\nsuggesting that profilin phosphorylation is in part associated with\n\nactivating MMPs, consecutively facilitating cellular mobility.\n\nPDBu can stimulate MMP14 and inhibiting PKCf could reduce\nrecruitment of MMP9 to podosomes and its release and activation\n\n[66]. The coordinated action of PI3K, PKC and profilin\n\nphosphorylation to induce MMPs needs further investigation to\n\ncharacterize the sequence of events in breast cancer progression.\n\nAnother interesting finding was phosphoprofilin\u2019s translocation to\n\nthe nucleus that requires in-depth analysis focusing on the function\n\nof profilin in the nucleus and subsequent role in breast cancer\n\nprogression. Very little information is available on nuclear\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\nprofilin\u2019s role in mammalian cells. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear\n\ndistribution of profilin has been observed in cultured mammalian\n\ncells [67,68]. Recent evidence from Skare et al. [69] suggests that\nprofilin-actin complexes may play a role in pre-mRNA processing\n\nwithin the nucleus, due to extensive co-localization of profilin with\n\nthe small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-associated Sm\n\nproteins and Cajal bodies. It is believed that mammalian\n\nembryogenesis requires nuclear and cytoplasmic profilin to\n\nmaintain normal embryo development by interacting with actin-\n\nrelated proteins such as Arp 3, VASP, Dia1 and p80 coilin [70]. It\n\nwould be interesting to demonstrate the importance of nuclear\n\nprofilin and nuclear phosphoprofilin in breast cancer progression\n\nand targeting profilin 1 phosphorylation for cancer therapy could\n\nbe a prudent option.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dr. Jieya Shao, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri for\n\nthe generous gift of pcDNA3.PFN.S137A vector and Dr. Partha Roy,\n\nUniversity of Pittsburg, PA for gifting actin and PLP mutants of profilin.\n\nWe appreciate the help of technical staff, Central Facilities for Research\n\nand Development, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: WR SSS.

Introduction\n\nnumber of factors regulate tumour cell growth, migration\nnd proliferation, and a major role is played by interac-\nions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1]. Integrins are\nell membrane-spanning proteins that bind to the ECM and\nontribute to the assembly of the cellular focal adhesion\nites in which focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is located. FAK\ns a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein that was origi-\nally detected in Rous sarcoma virus (v-src)-transformed\nhicken embryo fibroblasts [2]. A primary autophosphory-\nation site (Tyr397) is located in the N-terminal region of\nAK and directs the interaction with the Src homology-2\nomain [3]. Two highly conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr576\nnd Tyr577) are part of the central catalytic domain that is\nnvolved in signalling events to downstream effectors [4],\nnd multiple protein\u2014protein interaction sites are present\nn the C-terminal region [5]. FAK is a point of convergence for\nhe signalling events mediated by both integrins and growth\nactor receptors [6] that regulate processes, such as cell\ndhesion [5], motility [7], migration [8], and apoptosis [9].\n\nFAK phosphorylation leads to the activation of various\nownstream intracellular signalling molecules such as Src\namily kinases [10], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [11], phos-\nholipase C [12] and Grb7 [13]. As all of these effectors\nctivate pathways that are intimately involved in neoplastic\nransformation, invasion and metastases, FAK may play an\nmportant role in tumourigenesis [14], a hypothesis that is\nupported by the original isolation of the human FAK gene\nrom a primary human sarcoma [15] and the high FAK lev-\nls found in several tumour cell lines of different origin [16].\nAK is also up-regulated in different primary human tumours\nncluding breast, colorectal [17], prostate [18], thyroid [19],\nvarian [20], and brain tumours [21]. The extent of its mRNA\nxpression has been linked to the progression of epithe-\nial and mesenchymal tumours to invasive and metastatic\nhenotypes [22], and to poor prognoses in patients with hep-\ntocellular carcinoma [23] and acute myeloid leukemia [24].\ninally, at cell level, FAK regulates matrix metalloproteinase\nxpression and secretion, and EGF-stimulated chemotaxis\notility [14].\nThe FAK signal transduction pathway may be a promising\n\narget for cancer therapy [14]. It has recently been shown\nhat inhibiting FAK expression and activation by inducing\nAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) increases the sensitivity of\nransformed human kidney epithelial cells to 5-fluorouracil,\nhich suggests that FAK may play a role in tumour chemore-\n\nistance [25]. The same has been found in pancreatic ade-\nocarcinoma cells, in which the suppression of FAK expres-\nion by means of mRNA interference enhances gemcitabine-\nnduced in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity, and increases\numour susceptibility to chemotherapy [26]. Moreover, the\nctivation of FAK and its molecular partners improves cell\nesistance to ionizing radiation in lung adenocarcinoma cells\n27]. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in\nestern countries: its incidence continues to increase [28]\n\nnd it has a poor prognosis as only 15% of affected subjects\n\nurvive for 5 years or more after diagnosis [29]. However,\nespite the increasing importance of FAK in human cancer,\nhere is still a lack of data concerning FAK expression in pri-\nary human NSCLCs. The aim of this study was to investigate\n\nhe expression and clinical significance of FAK in 60 surgically\n\nL\n\ufffd\nS\no\ni\n\nS. Carelli et al.\n\nesected stage I\u2014IV NSCLCs with known clinicopathological\neatures.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Patients and samples\n\nhe study population consisted of 60 NSCLC patients who\nnderwent curative surgical resection, without having pre-\niously received chemotherapy or radiation therapy; all of\nhe enrolled patients have their informed consent to the\ntudy.\n\nTissue samples representative of the tumour, non-\neoplastic lung parenchyma (normal tissue sections and\neactive lung parenchyma adjacent to carcinomas) and five\nicroscopically normal lung specimens were routinely fixed\n\nn 10% buffered neutral formalin, and processed for conven-\nional histopathological examination. Immediately adjacent\neoplastic specimens and 21 macroscopically non-neoplastic\nissue samples (taken as far as possible from the neoplastic\nrea) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 min of\nurgical resection, and standard 5 \ufffdm thick sections from\naraffin-embedded blocks were stained with hematoxylin\nnd eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Tumour his-\notype and stage were, respectively, determined according\no the WHO classification of lung and pleural tumours (1999)\nnd the TNM staging system (1997). All of the non-neoplastic\namples were microscopically judged to be benign.\n\nThe clinical follow-up of 43 patients was available for a\nean post-surgical period of 28 months (range: 12\u201445); the\n\nollow-up data were obtained by means of direct patient\nontact at 2-month intervals for the first 2 years and 4-\nonth intervals thereafter. At the time of the last follow-up,\n\n3 patients had died for cancer-related causes. The clinico-\nathological characteristics of the study patients are shown\nn Table 1.\n\n.2. Tissue homogenisation and protein\nuantification\n\nresh frozen lung tissues were homogenised under iso-\nonic condition (25 mM Tris\u2014HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose,\n% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1% NP-40 (v/v), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM\nGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, 1 mM aprotinin,\nmM leupeptin, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM sodium\noride) using an ULTRA-TURRAX T25 homogeniser (IKA-\n\nabortechnik GmbH, Staufen, Germany).

Results\n\n.1. FAK Western blotting\n\nestern blotting was used to evaluate p125FAK protein\nxpression in 16 NSCLCs (six stage I, six stage II, four stage III)\nTable 1) and paired non-neoplastic lung parenchymas. FAK\nxpression was significantly increased in 13 NSCLC samples\nn comparison with their non-neoplastic counterparts. The\nestern blotting of seven samples is shown in Fig. 1(panel\n); the ratio between the optical density of the neoplas-\nic (T) and non-neoplastic (N) tissues (OD T/N) of the same\natients was calculated and expressed graphically (Fig. 1,\nanel B). The increased expression of FAK in the NSCLCs\ns documented by the mean ratio of 2.98 (range 0\u20147.3),\nnd comparable results were obtained using a polyclonal\nntibody specific for the FAK N-terminal portion (data not\nhown). FAK activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphoryla-\n\nion [32], and so the phosphorylation status of FAK tyrosine\nesidues measured by specific antibodies can be considered\nn index of protein activation. All of the evaluated tyro-\nine residues (see Section 2) were phosphorylated in the\neoplastic and non-neoplastic specimens, with no quan-\n\nanalysis was made in all other 15 patients with similar results\n(data not shown).

Tissue localisation of FAK by\nimmunohistochemistry\n\nFAK immunoreactivity was detected in both normal and neo-\nplastic lung cells. In normal bronchus, FAK protein expression\nwas detected in epithelial ciliated and basal cells, chon-\ndrocytes, and the ductal and serous cells of the submu-\ncosal glands; FAK immunostaining was also detected in the\nendothelial cells of the vessels within the lung parenchyma.\nImmunoreactivity was greater in reactive lesions, such as\nsquamous metaplastic bronchial epithelium, and in the\nhyperplastic/reactive pneumocytes surrounding the neo-\nplasia. Fig. 2 shows FAK protein immunodetection in non-\nneoplastic lung parenchyma.\n\nIn comparison with the non-neoplastic lung parenchy-\nmas, FAK was overexpressed in every neoplastic tissue\nsection. Furthermore, FAK immunoreactivity was stronger\nin the NSCLCs than in previously described reactive lung\nlesions, with moderate-strong immunoreactivity in between\n40% and more than 90% of tumour cells. Forty-six of\nthe NSCLCs (77%) were HE (moderate-intense immunore-\nactivity in more than 70% neoplastic cells; scores 6\nand 9), 10 (17%) were IE (moderate immunoreactivity in\n40\u201470% of neoplastic cells; score 4), and 4 (7%) were LE\n(moderate-intense immunoreactivity in less than 40% neo-\nplastic cells; scores 2 and 3). FAK was also observed in\nthe endothelial cells of the vessels within the neoplastic\nstroma.\n\nFurthermore, as shown in Table 2, there was no sig-\n\nnificant difference in FAK immunostaining between the\ntwo most represented tumour histotypes (ADK versus SQ,\np = 0.947, \ufffd2-test).

Three tumour samples were discarded because\nof RNA degradation, but FAK mRNA was assayed in all of\nthe remaining 57 and ranged from 0.5n to 4.5n (mean 1.8n;\nmedian 1.5n).

Expression of \ufffd1-integrin and p53 in NSCLCs\n\nhe correlations between FAK up-regulation and changes in\nther adhesion- and apoptosis-related proteins were evalu-\nted by Western blotting in 12 of the above samples. The\nxpression of \ufffd1-integrin was comparable in the neoplastic\nnd non-neoplastic lung tissues (p = 0.13, t-test), as can be\neen in the example of Western blotting and densitomet-\nic analysis of all of the examined cases in Fig. 5 (panel\n). The up-regulation of FAK therefore seems to be spe-\nific among adhesion-related molecules. We also assessed\nhe pro-apoptotic p53 protein, which is capable of suppress-\nng FAK expression [31], and found that the increased FAK\nxpression in NSCLCs did not correspond to changes in p53\nxpression in any of the 12 cases (p = 0.3, t-test) (Fig. 5,\nanel B).\n\n. Discussion\n\nAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell motility\n7], migration [8], apoptosis [9] and cell matrix interac-\nions [6]. All of these processes are crucial for neoplastic\nransformation, invasion and dissemination, and suggest a\notential role of FAK in the development and progression\nf cancer [14]. FAK is overexpressed in a variety of human\numours including breast [17], colorectal [17,33], prostate\n18,34], thyroid [19], ovarian [20], endometrial [35], and\nrain cancers [21]. Agents aimed at inhibiting the FAK signal\nransduction pathway may be useful in the development of\nffective new anticancer therapies [14,36]. Inhibited FAK\nFig. 3 FAK protein overexpression in NSCLCs as detected by imm\nmous cell carcinoma. Original magnification: (A) \u00d7600 and (B) \u00d74\n\nimmunostaining. Considering all of the FAK protein expres-\nsion values, Western blotting showed a statistically signif-\nicant correlation between higher protein levels and a high\ntumour stage (stage I + II versus stage III + IV, p = 0.019). The\nFAK mRNA overexpression revealed by real-time RT-PCR not\nonly correlated with a high tumour stage (stage I + II ver-\nsus stage III + IV, p = 0.028), but there was also a statistically\nsignificant association between FAK mRNA level and tumour\nsize (T1 versus T2, T3 and T4, p = 0.046).\n\nThe association between FAK mRNA measured by real-\ntime RT-PCR and the presence of node metastases at the\ntime of resection was also observed. The 21 matched spec-\nimens were analysed separately and sub-classified on the\nctivity or modulated FAK expression have recently been\nssociated with the decreased resistance of human pan-\nreatic adenocarcinoma cells to acquired apoptosis with\netachment from the ECM [37], the increased sensitivity of\nransformed human kidney epithelial cells to 5-fluorouracil\n\n\n\nFAK in lung cancer 269\n\nFig. 5 FAK regulation in NSCLCs. \ufffd1-integrin (A) and p53 (B) expression in matched neoplastic (T) and non-neoplastic homogenates\nhown\ns are\nE. of\n\nc\nm\nn\nb\nt\nT\nt\no\ni\nb\np\nc\nr\no\n\nc\na\nm\nt\nt\ns\na\ns\ni\na\np\ns\nc\nt\np\n\n(N) of 12 NSCLC patients.

We analysed\n60 tumours by means of immunohistochemistry and quan-\ntitative real-time RT-PCR, 16 of which were also analysed\nby Western blotting, and provide immunohistochemical and\nmolecular evidence of FAK up-regulation in NSCLCs. FAK\ndistribution within neoplastic tissue was quite diffuse and\nhomogeneous, thus supporting its potential role in confer-\nring an advantage on growth and survival, and giving tumour\ncells more invasive behaviour [16]. We also found that FAK\nup-regulation is common in NSCLCs, regardless of tumour\nhistotype and grade: weak-moderate FAK immunostaining\nwas detected in ciliated basal epithelial cells, ductal cells\nof the submucosal glands of the bronchus, as well as in\nchondrocytes and vessel endothelial cells of non-neoplastic\nlung parenchyma. Interestingly, more intense FAK protein\nimmunostaining was observed in bronchial squamous meta-\nplastic epithelium and hyperplastic alveolar cells, which are\nconsidered reactive changes that may evolve into dysplastic\nand neoplastic transformations.\n\nThese immunohistochemical observations may partially\nexplain our quantitative Western blotting and real-time RT-\nPCR evaluations of FAK protein and mRNA in non-neoplastic\nlung tissues. FAK mRNA levels were significantly higher in the\nneoplastic than in the non-neoplastic lung samples, which is\nconsistent with previous observations of FAK overexpression\nin human malignancies [16]. Moreover, all of the neoplas-\ntic samples whose FAK overexpression was determined by\nWestern blotting and real-time RT-PCR came from patients\nwith a high tumour stage at the time of resection. Taken\n\ntogether, these findings suggest that FAK up-regulation may\nbe an early event in lung neoplastic transformation, and fur-\nther support previously published data favouring its crucial\nrole in the development and maintenance of human cancers\n[17,32,33].\n\nc\ns\ni\np\nt\n\n; the quantitative densitometric ratio between the neoplastic\nplotted under the gel images. As a gel loading control, the\ntwo independent experiments with similar results.\n\nWe also found that the expression of \ufffd1-integrin does not\nhange in NSCLCs, and so it is possible that FAK up-regulation\nay be specific to NSCLCs. Furthermore, the up-regulation is\n\not accompanied by any changes in FAK activity, as assessed\ny evaluating the extent of protein phosphorylation [32]:\nhe five tyrosine residues analysed (Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576,\nyr577 and Tyr861) proved to be equally phosphorylated in\nhe neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. It is known that\nne of the possible mechanisms involved in FAK regulation\ns the action of p53, which inhibits FAK transcription [31],\nut we found that the expression of p53 in our tumour sam-\nles overexpressing FAK was comparable with that in the\nontrol non-tumoural lung tissues. It is possible that the up-\negulation of FAK may be due to the amplification of its gene\nr p53 gene mutations.\n\nFAK overexpression in human malignancies has been asso-\niated with cancer cell migration and invasiveness, and more\nggressive tumour behaviour including distant and/or nodal\netastases [17,23,24,38,39]. The lack of FAK signalling in\n\nhe endothelial cells of FAK\u2212/\u2212 mice embryos has shown\nhat the function of this protein is crucial for morphogene-\nis and the formation of blood vessels [40]. In addition, FAK\nctivation in mouse microvascular endothelial cells is neces-\nary to regulate in vitro tube formation [41]. We found FAK\nmmunoreactivity in the endothelial cells of both neoplastic\nnd adjacent non-neoplastic lung parenchyma, similarly to\nreviously described findings in the vascular network of oral\nquamous cancers [41], and the microvascular endothelial\nells of malignant astrocytic tumours [42]. These charac-\neristics may explain the invasive and metastatic malignant\nhenotype of tumours overexpressing FAK.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides the first immunohisto-\n\nhemical and molecular evidence that increased FAK tran-\ncript levels and protein expression are common events\nn NSCLC. By immunohistochemistry, FAK protein overex-\nression was also detectable in reactive changes, such as\nhe squamous cell metaplasia of bronchial epithelial cells\n\n\n\n2\n\na\nt\nt\nr\nb\nt\nT\nl\ni\nn\nv\np\nf\n\nA\n\nT\nI\n\nR\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n70\n\nnd alveolar hyperplasia. The immunohistochemical detec-\nion of FAK overexpression in all of our cases regardless of\numour stage supports the hypothesis that FAK may play a\nole in maintaining the malignancy of the morphological and\niological characteristics of transformed lung cells, rather\nhan a crucial role in the later stages of NSCLC progression.\nhe detection of FAK overexpression, particularly at protein\n\nevel, may represent a novel target for inhibitory therapies\nn lung cancer [43]. However, the up-regulation of FAK could\not be statistically related to disease-free or overall sur-\nival in our patients probably because of the short follow-up\neriod. The prognostic significance of FAK in NSCLCs there-\nore requires further evaluation.\n\ncknowledgement\n\nhis work was supported in part by a grant from Associazione\ntaliana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC).\n\neferences\n\n[1] Aplin AE, Howe AK, Juliano RL.

MicroRNAs  (miRNAs)  can  act as  oncogenes  or tumor-suppressor  genes  in  human  malignancy.  The\nmiR-34  family  is comprised  of  tumor-suppressive  miRNAs,  and  its  reduced  expression  by  methylation\nhas  been  reported  in  various  cancers,  including  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  In  this  study,  we\ninvestigated  the alteration  and  tumor-suppressive  impact  of  miR-34s  in SCLC.  The  methylation  of  miR-\n34a and  miR-34b/c  was  observed  in  4 (36%)  and  7  (64%)  of  11  SCLC  cell  lines,  respectively.

The  frequency  of  miR-34b/c  methylation  was  significantly  higher  in  SCLC\nthan  in  NSCLC  (p  <  0.001).

We  examined  the  effect  of  miR-34b/c  introduction  on\ncell  proliferation,  migration  and  invasion.  The  transfection  of  miR-34b/c  to two  SCLC cell  lines  (H1048\nand  SBC5)  resulted  in  the  significant  inhibition  of  cell  growth,  migration,  and  invasion,  compared  with\ncontrol  transfectants.

Introduction\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in\nhe world at present. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggres-\nive tumor with a dismal prognosis among primary lung cancers\nnd accounts for approximately 13% of all lung cancers [1,2].\nhemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is generally the treatment\nf choice for SCLC patients because the clinical features of SCLC\nnclude a high rate of metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs\neginning at an early stage. A strong initial response but early\n\ncquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a unique feature\nf SCLC [3,4], resulting in a poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate\nf only 5% [5].  Thus, the development of new therapeutic strategies\ns mandatory.\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author. Tel.: +81 86 235 7265; fax: +81 86 235 7269.\nE-mail address: toyooka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp (S.

All rights reserved.\n\nThe understanding of molecular pathogenesis is crucial for the\ndevelopment of new therapeutic strategies for malignant tumors.\nOf note, the profile of molecular alterations is quite different among\nthe histological subtypes of lung cancer [6\u20138]. For example, epider-\nmal  growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations [9],  K-ras mutations\nand P16 methylation [8] are frequently found in non-small cell lung\ncancer (NSCLC), but not in SCLC [10]. In contrast, TP53 mutations\n[8,11] or RASSF1A methylation [12] is frequently found in SCLC,\ncompared with NSCLC. These results indicate that the molecular\npathogenesis differs between SCLC and NSCLC.\n\nMany studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can act as\noncogenes or tumor suppressors and that the widespread alter-\nation of miRNA expression patterns is highly relevant to various\n\nhuman malignancies [13]. In lung cancer, the reduced expression\nof let-7 [14] or the overexpression of miR-155 [15] is reportedly\ncorrelated with the clinical outcome of NSCLC. Among the miRNAs,\nmiRNA-34 (miR-34) family members reportedly play important\ntumor-suppressive roles, as they are directly regulated by p53 and\n\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.10.002\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01695002\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/lungcan\nmailto:toyooka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp\ndx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.10.002\n\n\ng Can\n\nc\ni\ng\nw\nm\no\na\nm\nt\ni\ne\no\na\ni\n\nf\np\ni\no\n\n2\n\n2\n\nN\nS\nt\nU\nw\nn\no\nr\nb\nr\nn\ni\nl\n\nH\n(\nN\nH\nN\nN\nH\nH\nc\n,\nU\nl\n(\nI\nw\ns\ni\nm\ni\nw\nw\nd\nt\nc\nd\nm\n\nN. Tanaka et al. / Lun\n\nompose the p53 network [16]. The members of the miR-34 fam-\nly consist of three miRNAs (miR-34a, 34b and 34c), the target\nenes of which are considered to be similar to one another but\nith some notable differences [17]. miR-34a is located on chro-\nosome 1q36.22, while miR-34b and 34c (miR-34b/c) are located\n\nn chromosome 11q23 and are generated by the processing of\n single transcript [17]. A previous study indicated that miR-34\nethylation was present in NSCLC and was significantly related\n\no an unfavorable clinical outcome [18]. In a functional analysis the\nntroduction of miR-34b/c into NSCLC suppressed the cell prolif-\nration of NSCLC [19]. However, these studies examining the roles\nf miRNA in lung cancer have been mainly performed for NSCLC,\nnd miRNA alterations and their impact on SCLC have not been\nnvestigated.\n\nIn this study, we investigated miR-34 methylation in SCLC and\nound that miR-34b/c was frequently methylated in SCLC, com-\nared with NSCLC. Subsequently, we investigated the biological\n\nmpact of miR-34b/c methylation on SCLC to understand the role\nf miR-34b/c in the tumorigenesis of SCLC.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Clinical samples and cell lines\n\nA total of lung cancer specimens comprising 12 SCLC, 47\nSCLC resected tumors, and 15 malignant pleural effusions in\nCLC patients were retrieved from Okayama University Hospi-\nal, Okayama, Japan and NHO Yamaguchi-Ube Medical Center,\nbe, Yamaguchi, Japan. Each resected tumor was  not treated\nith preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Corresponding\non-malignant tissue (peripheral lung or bronchial epithelium)\nf resected tumors were also available. Fifteen malignant pleu-\nal effusions were obtained from 8 patients who were treated\ny chemotherapy or radiotherapy and 7 patients who  were not\neceived any treatment. All the specimens were frozen with liquid\nitrogen immediately after surgery and stored at \u221280 \u25e6C. Written\n\nnformed consents were obtained from all the patients at two  col-\nection sites.\n\nEleven SCLC cell lines [NCI-H1048 (H1048), SBC5, HCC33, NCI-\n211 (H211), NCI-H524 (H524), NCI-H841 (H841), NCI-H1688\n\nH1688), NCI-H1870 (H1870), NCI-H2141 (H2141), NCI-H82 (H82),\nCI-H249 (H249)] and 14 NSCLC cell lines [PC-9, HCC827, NCI-\n1975 (H1975), NCI-H3255 (H3255), A549, NCI-H1395 (H1395),\nCI-H522 (H522), NCI-H838 (H838), HCC15, NCI-H125 (H125),\nCI-H460 (H460), NCI-H661 (H661), NCI-H1299 (H1299), NCI-\n358 (H358)] were used in this study. We  also investigated the\nBEC 5KT cell, established from non-malignant human bronchial\nells. Cell lines whose prefix is NCI-H- (abbreviated as H-) or HCC-\n\n and HBEC 5KT were kindly provided by Dr. Adi F. Gazdar (The\nniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dal-\n\nas, TX). SBC5 was obtained from Drs. M.  Tanimoto and K. Kiura\nOkayama University, Okayama, Japan). PC-9 was obtained from\nmmuno-Biological Laboratories (Takasaki, Gunma, Japan). A549\n\nas obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manas-\nas, VA). All the cell lines except for HBEC 5KT were maintained\nn RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)  supple-\n\nented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 \u25e6C\nn a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. HBEC 5KT cell line\n\nas maintained in Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)\nith bovine pituitary extract (BPE) and human recombinant epi-\nermal growth factor (EGF). H82, H249, H1048, and SBC5 were\n\nreated with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) at a\noncentration of 5\u201310 \ufffdM for 6 days, with medium changes on\nays 1, 3, and 5, to restore gene expression that was reduced by\nethylation.\ncer 76 (2012) 32\u2013 38 33\n\n2.2. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) assay\n\nGenomic DNA was  extracted from cell lines and tissues by stan-\ndard phenol\u2013chloroform (1:1) extraction or by DNeasy Tissue Kit\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was  subjected to bisulfate treatment\nusing the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit (Zymo Research Corp.,\nIrvine, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For malig-\nnant pleural effusions, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp\nCirculating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen) and bisulfite conversion was\nperformed using Epitect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol. The methylation statuses of miR-34a and\n34b/c were determined by MSP  assay using specific primers for\nthe methylated and unmethylated forms [20]. The DNA from HBEC\n5KT was  treated with SssI methyltransferase (New England BioLabs,\nBeverly, MA)  and was used as a positive control for methylated alle-\nles. PCR products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels and stained with\nethidium bromide.\n\n2.3. miR-34s expression by quantitative RT-PCR\n\nThe miRNA was isolated from cell lines and tissue speci-\nmens with TaqMan MicroRNA Cells-to-CTTM Kit (Ambion, Austin,\nTX) and mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) and treated\nwith DNase I (Ambion) to remove genomic DNA. Reverse tran-\nscriptional (RT) reaction was  performed for extracted 0.5 \ufffdg\nmiRNA with TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcriptional Kit sys-\ntems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan single\nRT primers for each miRNA (Applied Biosystems). The quantita-\ntive RT-PCR for miR-34a, 34b, and 34c using TaqMan MicroRNA\nAssays technology (Perkin Elmer Corp., Foster City, CA) with the\nStep One Plus Real Time PCR systems (Applied Biosystems). The\nmiR-374 expression was  used to normalize the expression of\nmiR-34s as endogenous control of cell lines following manu-\nfacturer\u2019s recommendation (www.appliedbiosystems.com). After\nnormalization of miR-34s expression to miR-374, all relative\nexpression values were defined as the ratios of the normalized\nmiR-34s expression value of cell lines or primary tumors to that\nof HBEC 5KT or individual non-malignant lung tissue, respec-\ntively.\n\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry for p53 expression\n\nAbnormality of p53 expression was examined using immuno-\nhistochemistry for primary tumors. To detect the p53 protein, we\nused a monoclonal antibody against human p53 (DAKO-p53, DAKO,\nDenmark). The routinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tis-\nsue blocks were sectioned at a 4 \ufffdm thickness. They were stained\nby hematoxylin and eosin stain to confirm the presence and\nintensity of tumor cells and processed for immunohistochemistry\n(IHC). Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated\nwith graded ethanol, and immersed in Tris\u2013buffered saline for\nIHC. For p53 scoring, more than 10 randomly chosen high power\nfields were evaluated under an optical microscope and a trained\npathologist was defined blindly scored. In this study, p53 muta-\ntional status was  defined as positive when more than 15% of cells\nwere positive regardless of the intensity as previously reported\n[21,22].\n\n2.5. Plasmid construction and gene transfection\n\nThe miR-34b/c or scramble fragment as control was subcloned\ninto pSilencer 4.1-CMV neo Plasmid Vector (Ambion). Four \ufffdg of\n\npSilencer 4.1-CMV neo Vector was  introduced into SCLC cell lines\nusing LipofectamineTM 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen).

Cells were cultured and counted 14 days later after\ntaining with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 5 min  at\noom temperature. The number of visible colonies (>50 cells) was\nounted.\n\n.7. Cell migration and invasion assays\n\nCell migration and invasion ability were established using a\noyden chamber assay with filter inserts (pore size, 8 \ufffdm)  in\n-well plates (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA).\nhe cells in 2 ml  serum-free RPMI1640 medium (300 \ufffdl contain-\nng 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells for transwell migration assay and 5 \u00d7 105 for\n\natrigel invasion assay) were added to the top chamber. The\nottom chamber was prepared with 10% FBS as a chemoattrac-\nant. Non-invasive cells were removed by scrubbing with a cotton\nwab after 24\u201348 and 48\u201396 h of incubation for migration assay\nnd invasion assay, respectively. The cells that had migrated\nhrough the membrane and stuck to the lower surface of the\n\nembrane were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik stain (Sysmex,\nobe, Japan). For quantification of migration and invasion, the cells\nere counted under a microscope in 5 predetermined fields at\n100 magnifications representing the average of 3 independent\nxperiments.\n\n.8. Western blot analysis\n\nCells were grown to 80% confluency and harvested in lysis\nuffer [20 mmol/L Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L\na2EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophos-\nhate, 1 mmol/L \ufffd-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 \ufffdg/ml\n\neupeptin] (Cell signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)  supplemented\nith Complete, Mini (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to extract protein.\n\notal 30 \ufffdg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred\no PVDF membranes. The proteins on membranes were incubated\nvernight at 4 \u25e6C with the primary antibodies. We  selected two\nolecules (c-MET and CDK6). The primary antibodies for Western\n\nlotting are as follows: anti-MET (25H2, Cell Signaling), anti-\nhospho-MET (3D7, Tyr1234/1235; Cell Signaling), and anti-CDK6\nDCS83, Cell Signaling). The following secondary antibodies were\nsed: goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-conjugated horseradish\neroxidase (HRP) (Santa Cruz). To detect specific signals, the mem-\nranes were detected by ECL plus Western Blotting Detection\neagents (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Buckinghamshire,\nK).\n\n.9. Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Win-\nows version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). All of the in vitro\nxperiments were performed at least three times.

Methylation and expression status of miR-34s\n\nWe examined the methylation frequencies of miR-34a and b/c\nin 11 SCLC cell lines, 27 clinical samples consisting of 12 primary\ntumors and 15 malignant pleural effusions. Usefulness of malignant\npleural effusions to detect DNA methylation has been previously\nreported [23]. For comparison purposes, the methylation frequen-\ncies of miR-34a and b/c were also examined in 14 NSCLC cell\nlines and 47 primary tumors. Representative images of the elec-\ntrophoresis results are shown in Fig. 1. MSP  of the cell lines showed\nthree PCR band patterns: only a methylated band, both a methy-\nlated and an unmethylated band, and only a methylated band. The\npresence of both methylated and unmethylated bands indicated\npartial methylation. In this study, cell lines with partial methyla-\ntion were classified as methylated cell lines. The methylation of\nmiR-34a and miR-34b/c was  observed in 4 (36%) and 7 (64%) out of\n11 SCLC cell lines, respectively. Among the 27 SCLC clinical speci-\nmens, miR-34a and miR-34b/c were methylated in 4 (15%) and 18\n(67%), respectively. Stratified by specimens, miR-34a methylation\nwas  found in 3 of 12 SCLC tumors and 1 of 15 malignant pleural\neffusions and miR-34b/c methylation was found in 9 of 12 tumors\nand 9 of 15 malignant pleural effusions. There was no significant\ndifference in frequency of methylation between resected tumors\nand malignant pleural effusion specimens. In addition, no signifi-\ncant difference was found in the frequencies of miR-34 methylation\nbetween previously treated 8 pleural effusions (0% in miR-34a and\n\n75% in miR-34b/c) and 7 pleural effusions without any treatment\n(14% in miR-34a and 57% in miR-34b/c), respectively. Among the\nNSCLC tumors, miR-34a and miR-34b/c methylation were observed\n\n\n\nN.

The frequency of miR-34b/c methylation was\nignificantly higher among the SCLC primary tumors than among\nhe NSCLC samples (p < 0.001).\n\n.2. Relationship between methylation and expression in SCLC\n\nThe expressions of miR-34a, 34b, and 34c in 11 SCLC cell\nines and 6 available SCLC primary tumors (4 methylated and 2\nnmethylated cases) were examined using quantitative RT-PCR\nTables 1 and 2). The expression values of the miR-34s were defined\ns the ratio of the normalized expression value of SCLC cell lines\no that of HBEC 5KT and that of the primary SCLC tumors to that\nf individual non-malignant lung tissue with arbitrarily assigned\nalues of 1, respectively. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, all expression\nalues of miR-34s in SCLC cell lines and primary tumors were lower\nhan their normal control samples (HBEC 5KT and non-malignant\nung tissue). The expressions of the miR-34b and 34c were signifi-\nantly lower in the methylated cell lines than in the unmethylated\nell lines (miR-34b, p = 0.011; miR-34c, p = 0.008). Regarding miR-\n4a, no significant difference or tendency was detected (p = 0.107).\nhis finding may  reflect the small sample sizes or the presence of\nartially methylated cells. One cell line (H2141) with unmethylated\niR-34a had very low expression value (0.05) for miR-34a, suggest-\n\nng the presence of an alternative mechanism for gene silencing.\nWe  also treated 4 cell lines with DAC and found that the expres-\n\nions of the miR-34s were restored in the methylated SCLC cell lines\nut not in the unmethylated cell lines (Table 3).\n\n.3. p53 status in SCLC\n\np53 is a transcriptional factor for miR-34s. Thus, we examined\nhe correlation between the p53 status and the expressions of miR-\n4s (Table 2). Genotyping data for the TP53 gene in H1048, SBC5,\n211, H524, H841, H2141, H82, and H249 were queried from the\natabase of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)\nersion 15 (www-p53.iarc.fr) to find that all cell lines harbor TP53\nutation. HCC33 and H1870 also harbor mutation (HCC33, C242Y\n\nnd H1870, Y234C) and these data were provided by Dr. Adi F. Gaz-\n\nar (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas,\nallas, TX, USA). The mutation status of H1688 was not available.\ns a result, 10 out of 11 cell lines were found to carry TP53 muta-\n\nions. The p53 status of the primary tumors was determined using\n-34b/c) or control (p-scramble) plasmid vectors. (A) Representative results of colony\nlony formation efficiencies are presented. Shown are means of three replications;\n\nimmunohistochemistry [21,22].  The aberrant positive expression\nof p53 protein was regarded as a p53 abnormality (mutation) in\nthe primary cancers. Four (67%) out of the 6 primary SCLC tumors\nexhibited positive p53 immunohistochemistry results suggesting\nthe presence of p53 mutation. The relationship between the p53\nalterations and the expressions of miR-34s was examined, but no\ncorrelation between the p53 status and the expressions of miR-34s\nwas  found.\n\n3.4. Impact of miR-34b/c on cell proliferation\n\nBecause the frequency of methylation was higher in miR-34b/c\nand because miR-34a methylation in SCLC cell lines was mainly\npartial methylation but miR-34b/c was heavily methylation, we\nfocused on miR-34b/c for a functional analysis. For this purpose, we\nestablished stable transfectants with miR-34b/c and scramble con-\ntrols for H1048 and SBC5. To examine the anti-proliferative effect\nof miR-34b/c induction, we  performed a colony formation assay\nfor stable transfectants. Cell proliferation was significantly inhib-\nited in the SCLC cells transfected with miR-34b/c, compared with\nthat in the cells that were transfected with a scramble control (50%\ninhibition for H1048, p = 0.001; 44% for SBC5, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).\n\n3.5. Impact of miR-34b/c on cell migration and invasion\n\nTo estimate the effect of introducing miR-34b/c on the migration\nand invasion potential of SCLC, cell migration and invasion poten-\ntial were examined using a Boyden chamber. Microscopy images\nof the Boyden chamber assay are shown in Fig. 3. Migration and\ninvasion were significantly suppressed in miR-34b/c transfectants,\ncompared with control transfectants (migration: 50% inhibition for\nH1048, p = 0.051; 54% for SBC5, p = 0.044; invasion: 33% inhibition\nfor H1048, p = 0.002; 30% inhibition for SBC5, p = 0.012).\n\n3.6. Protein expression of stable transfectants\n\nTo examine the effect of miR-34b/c introduction, we focused\non c-MET (both total and phosphorylated types) and CDK6 which\nwere the putative target of miR-34b/c. Western blotting was  carried\n\nout in SCLC stable transfectants. Total and phosphorylated c-MET\nand CDK6 expressions were down-regulated in the SCLC cell lines\nexamined. CDK6 tended to be down-regulated by the miR-34b/c in\ncell lines whose native protein expression was present (Fig. 4).\n\nhttp://www-p53.iarc.fr/\n\n\n36 N.

Discussion\n\nIn this study, we found that miR-34b/c methylation was a fre-\nuent alteration of SCLC. As a result, miR-34b/c expression was\neduced in SCLC, causing tumor cell proliferation and invasive-\ness. Our results also indicated that miR-34b/c methylation is the\narly event for tumorigenesis of SCLC because there was  no differ-\nnce in frequency between surgically resected tumors supposed\no be early stage and malignant pleural effusions considered to\ne advanced stage. In addition to lung cancer, miR-34b/c methy-\n\nation has been reported in various kinds of malignant tumors\nncluding colorectal and ovarian cancers [20,24].  We  previously\neported the methylation and function of miR-34b/c in malignant\nleural mesothelioma [25]; the same established methodology was\nlso used in the present study. p53 is a transcriptional factor for\niR-34s. The p53 mutation has been reported in various cancers,\nncluding lung cancer. However, the effect of p53 mutation on the\nxpression and methylation of miR-34b/c remains uncertain. In\nvarian cancer, miR-34a methylation and p53 mutation are not\nssociated.

In addition, p53 mutation has no effect on miR-34b/c\nmethylation in ovarian cancer [24]. In the SCLC cell lines that were\nexamined in the present study, 10 out of 11 cell lines carried a\np53 mutation, but the expression levels of the miR-34s varied and\nwere correlated with the methylation status. In primary tumors,\nwhile the p53 mutational status was  determined using immuno-\nhistochemistry [21,22], the relationship among the expression and\nmethylation of miR-34b/c and p53 mutation was similar to that\nin the cell lines. Our data suggest that miR-34 expression was not\ncompletely silenced in the p53-altered cases and that methylation\nmay  contribute more strongly to the expressions of miR-34s.\n\nAntitumor effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation,\nmigration, and invasion, were observed with the introduction of\nmiR-34b/c. In general, miRNA has multiple target mRNAs, and c-\nMet  is a well-known target molecule of miR-34b/c [16,17]. c-Met\n\nand its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have been shown to\nbe involved in cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis [26,27].\nA previous study found that the c-Met/HGF pathway was  func-\ntional in SCLC, indicating in vitro that the c-MET/HGF axis may\n\nFold change after DAC\n\nmiR-34a miR-34b miR-34c\n\n1.2 3.9 279.8\n3.8 1.9 20.5\n1.1 4.2 52.6\n1.8 2.8 2.2\n\n-34b/c expression in SCLC cell lines with methylation after 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine\nAC-treated cell lines compared with the miR-34s expression values in non-treated\n\n\n\nN.

Our results, together with\nhose of previous reports, strongly suggest that miR-34b/c plays\nn important role in the pathogenesis of SCLC and may  be a useful\nherapeutic target for SCLC.\n\nIn SCLC, the methylation of miR-34a was not a frequent event\nompared with that of miR-34b/c, but its expression was  low\nompared with that in non-malignant lung tissue. The degree of\n\neduction in miR-34a expression was similar to that of miR-34b/c\nn some SCLC cell lines, suggesting that miR-34a silencing may  also\ne involved in the pathogenesis of SCLC, although the mechanism\n\nig. 4.

The quantitative values expressed as the means \u00b1 SD of five microscopic\n\nof silencing has not been clearly elucidated. Further study on the\nrole of miR-34a in SCLC is warranted.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings showed that miR-34b/c is more\nfrequently methylated in SCLC than in NSCLC, resulting in the\ndown-regulation of miR-34b/c. As this alteration confers a growth\nand invasion advantage to cancer cells, targeting miR-34b/c is a\npotential therapeutic option for the treatment of SCLCs. The tar-\ngeting of SCLCs is of particular interest, as recent trials of targeted\ndrugs for lung cancer have focused mainly on NSCLCs.\n\nConflict of interest statement\n\nNone declared.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nWe  thank Adi F.

These putative relationships, indicated by PCR genotyping, were\ntested in the present study by further genotyping and phenotyping of 23 cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates\nfrom horses with GI disease (referred to hereafter as horse GI disease isolates). Our beta2-toxin (CPB2)\nWestern blot analyses demonstrated that all of the tested isolates were unable to produce detectable levels of\nCPB2. However, Southern blot and nucleotide sequencing analyses identified intact cpb2 open reading frames\nin all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase PCR and Northern blot\nanalyses showed that cpb2 genes in all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates were transcriptionally active,\ni.e., an \ufffd1.2-kb cpb2-specific mRNA was identified in total RNA from our surveyed isolates. The levels of cpb2\nmRNA in CWC245 (a high-CPB2-producing pig strain) and our surveyed horse GI disease isolates differed to\nsuch an extent (35-fold) that this difference could be considered as a major cause of the difference in levels of\nCPB2 production by CWC245 and horse GI disease isolates. This finding received further support from our\nobservation that the complementing strain 106902(pMRS140), which produced significantly higher levels of\nmRNA than strain 106902, produced high levels of CPB2. Collectively, our results indicated that there is a\npositive correlation between cpb2 transcription levels and the amount of CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell\nand that decreased transcription and/or message instability may be involved, at least in part, in the low CPB2\nproduction noted for horse GI disease isolates in comparison to that noted for pig GI disease isolate CWC245.\n\nClostridium perfringens is an important cause of histotoxic\nand gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in both humans and animals\n(20, 26). The virulence of this bacterium results largely from its\nability to produce at least 15 different toxins (21). C. perfringens\nisolates are commonly classified (21) into one of five types, A\nto E, based upon their ability to produce the four major lethal\ntoxins (i.e., alpha-, beta-, epsilon-, and iota-toxins). The major\nlethal toxins, however, are not the only biomedically important\ntoxins; some C. perfringens isolates (mostly those belonging to\ntype A) produce C. perfringens enterotoxin (20), and many\nisolates of both types A and C produce beta2-toxin (CPB2) (5,\n9, 11, 29)\n\nThe 28-kDa CPB2 was first purified from C. perfringens type\nC strain CWC245 and shown to be cytotoxic for Chinese ham-\nster ovary cells (15). Fisher et al. (9) recently demonstrated\nthat CPB2 produced by a non-food-borne human GI disease\nisolate is cytotoxic for CaCo-2 cells. Although cpb2 was initially\nidentified in C. perfringens type C isolates, a recent study (5)\ndemonstrated the presence of cpb2 sequences in all types of C.\nperfringens. The deduced amino acid sequence of CPB2 is\nhighly conserved in type A and C strains of C. perfringens\nisolated from diarrheic pigs (11, 29). However, the variability\nin CPB2 sequences in type A human isolates (9) coupled with\n\nCPB2 sequence differences in isolates from nonporcine ani-\nmals (16) indicate that CPB2 is an unusual C. perfringens toxin.\n\nSeveral epidemiological studies suggested that cpb2-positive\nC. perfringens isolates are highly associated with enteric dis-\neases in domestic animals, particularly enteritis in piglets (10,\n11, 18), typhlocolitis in horses (2, 13), diarrhea in dogs (27),\nulcerative enteritis in an African elephant (1), and enterotox-\nemia in calves (19). These putative associations between cpb2-\npositive isolates and GI diseases in animals remained tentative\nbecause this conclusion was drawn on the basis of PCR geno-\ntyping, in which only the presence of cpb2 sequences and not\nthe expression of cpb2 was demonstrated. Although a recent\nstudy (29), by demonstrating that all of the surveyed cpb2-\npositive isolates from pigs with GI disease (referred to here-\nafter as pig GI disease isolates) can, in fact, produce CPB2,\nconfirmed the association of cpb2-positive isolates with GI\ndiseases in piglets, no such evidence with a large number of\nclinical isolates has been provided in favor of an association of\ncpb2-positive isolates with GI diseases in nonporcine animals.\nEven though a recent study (5) demonstrated the production\nof CPB2 in 100% (n \ufffd 2), 50% (n \ufffd 10), and 40% (n \ufffd 5) of\nthe surveyed horse, bovine, and avian GI disease isolates, re-\nspectively, the correlation between PCR genotype and CPB2\nproduction in horse GI disease isolates still remained quite\ntentative due to the minute surveyed population.\n\nThe putative associations thus noted between cpb2-positive\nisolates and CPB2-associated horse GI diseases clearly require\nverification by analyzing larger numbers of horse GI disease\n\n* Corresponding author.

In response to this issue, our present study has per-\nformed the first in-depth molecular genetic and phenotypic\nanalysis of a large number of European cpb2-positive C. per-\nfringens type A isolates obtained from horses with GI diseases.\nResults from the present study indicate that there is a positive\ncorrelation between cpb2 transcription levels and the amount\nof CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and that decreased\ntranscription and/or message instability may be involved, at\nleast in part, in the low cpb2 expression levels observed in\nhorse isolates compared to the level in pig isolate CWC245.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial strains. The C. perfringens isolates used in this study are listed and\ndescribed in Table 1. The cpb2-positive C. perfringens horse GI disease isolates\nused in this study were identified earlier by multiplex PCR analysis (10, 13) as\ncpe-negative type A isolates. In this study, by using the reverse CAMP test (12),\nwe reconfirmed that all cpb2-positive type A isolates surveyed in this study\nproduced (data not shown) the arrow-shaped zone of synergistic hemolysis in-\ndicative of alpha-toxin expression.\n\nGrowth conditions. A starter culture (6 ml) of each C. perfringens isolate was\nprepared by overnight growth at 37\u00b0C in fluid thioglycolate broth (Difco) as\ndescribed previously (8). For DNA and RNA isolation or culture supernatant\nprotein preparation, an aliquot (0.2 ml) of each fluid thioglycolate broth culture\nwas inoculated into 10 ml of TGY broth (3% Trypticase, 2% glucose, 1% yeast\nextract, 0.1% cysteine [8]), which was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 to 24 h without\nshaking. (Note that, because of moderate aerotolerance, C. perfringens can grow\nin liquid medium without anaerobic incubation). For selection of C. perfringens\ntransformants carrying pMRS140, C. perfringens cultures were plated onto a\nbrain heart infusion agar plate containing erythromycin (50 \ufffdg/ml) and incu-\nbated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h in an anaerobic jar with BBL GasPak (Becton Dickinson\nand Company).\n\nProtein preparations and Western blot analysis. Culture supernatant fluid was\nseparated by centrifugation at 500 \ufffd g from 20-ml TGY cultures of C. perfringens\nisolates grown for 18 h at 37\u00b0C. This culture supernatant fluid was used to isolate\nsupernatant proteins by ammonium sulfate precipitation (29) or to concentrate\nto 20-fold at 4\u00b0C using Amicon Centricon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Mil-\nlipore). Total cell protein was prepared from the bacterial pellet of a 20-ml TGY\nculture which was used to prepare culture supernatant proteins as previously\ndescribed (29). Prepared proteins were electrophoresed on a 0.1% sodium do-\ndecyl sulfate\u201312% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a Sequi-Blot polyvi-\nnylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and CPB2 Western blot analysis was\nperformed as previously described (29).\n\nRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Southern blot anal-\nyses. A 318-bp digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cpb2-specific DNA probe was pre-\npared by using a two-step PCR amplification method as previously described\n(29). Isolated C. perfringens DNA samples, prepared as previously described (8,\n23), were digested with EcoRV or HpaI (New England Biolabs), separated by\nelectrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and Southern transferred. The blots were\nhybridized with the DIG-labeled cpb2 probe, which was then detected using a\nDIG chemiluminescence detection system utilizing CSPD [disodium 3-(4-\nmethoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2\ufffd-(5-chloro)tricyclo[3,3.1.13.7]decane}-4-yl)phenyl\nphosphate] ready-to-use substrate (Roche) as described earlier (23).\n\nPFGE and Southern blot analyses. Cells from overnight TGY cultures were\ncollected by centrifugation and used to prepare agarose plugs containing\ngenomic C. perfringens DNA as previously described (4, 6, 7, 24, 25). The undi-\ngested total unsheared genomic DNA in 100 \ufffdl of an agarose plug was electro-\nphoresed at 200 V with a Bio-Rad CHEF-DRII apparatus, with a pulse ramped\nfrom 50 to 90 s over 20 h (24, 25). These pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)\ngels were then subjected to cpb2 Southern blot analysis using the same procedure\ndescribed above.\n\nCloning and sequencing of the cpb2-containing fragment from various cpb2-\npositive isolates. A 1,373-bp DNA fragment carrying cpb2 open reading frame\n(ORF) and 262-bp upstream and 312-bp downstream sequences from each of\nthree horse GI disease isolates (106902, 106903, and AHT3553) was PCR am-\nplified using primers 5\ufffd-GCTCTAGAGGATATCTTAAATTTAGCACAG-3\ufffd\n\nTABLE 1.

These PCR products were then cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO\nvector using the TOPO XL cloning kit (Invitrogen). Both strands of the cpb2-\ncontaining DNA insert, from two clones for each isolate, were then sequenced\nusing M13 forward and reverse primers.\n\nRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from TGY cultures of C. perfrin-\ngens strains as previously described (8, 14). The primer set 5\ufffd-AAACTGAATT\nTTTAAATGGTGC-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-TCCACATCCAATGATCTACAA-3\ufffd, which am-\nplified a 318-bp cpb2 internal fragment, was used to detect cpb2-specific mRNA\nin total RNA preparations by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis with the\ncommercially available Access RT-PCR kit (Promega). After RT-PCR, the pres-\nence of an amplified product was analyzed by subjecting an aliquot of each\nsample to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining and\nvisualization under UV illumination. The presence of an amplified product of the\nexpected size was indicative of the presence of specific mRNA transcripts in total\nRNA preparations.\n\nNorthern blot analysis. A 560-bp internal cpb2 DNA fragment was amplified\nfrom CWC245 by PCR using primer set 5\ufffd-GGAGCAATAAGTCCAATGA\nA-3\ufffd and 5\ufffd-TCCACATCCAATGATCTACAA-3\ufffd and labeled with alkaline\nphosphatase using the Gene Images AlkPhos direct labeling and detection sys-\ntem (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA isolated from C. perfringens strains\ngrown in TGY broth at 37\u00b0C for different time periods as previously described (8,\n14) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and Northern trans-\nferred. The blots were hybridized with the alkaline phosphatase-labeled cpb2\nprobe, and hybridized probe was then detected by CDPstar chemiluminescence\n(Amersham Biosciences). The relative levels of cpb2 mRNA in horse GI disease\nisolates were determined from a calibration curve, which was made using various\namounts (0.1 to 5 \ufffdg) of RNA prepared from high-CPB2-producing pig strain\nCWC245. The densitometric analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer\nusing the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health and available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih\n-image/).\n\nConstruction of complementing strains 106902(pMRS140) and 106903\n(pMRS140). A 1,373-bp KpnI-XhoI fragment was extracted from pMW1 and\ncloned into KpnI/SalI sites of pJIR751 (3). Plasmid pMW1, which is a derivative\nof the pCR-XL-TOPO vector carrying the 106902 cpb2 ORF and its upstream\nand downstream sequences, was constructed for nucleotide sequencing analyses\nas described above. The plasmid pMRS140 was introduced into C. perfringens\n106902 and 106903 electrocompetent cells by electroporation as previously de-\nscribed (8, 23).\n\nRESULTS\n\nCPB2 production by cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates.\nOur collection of European horse GI disease isolates has been\npreviously identified (10, 13) as cpb2 positive by using a mul-\ntiplex PCR assay. Since a recent study (5) reported that only\n50% of nonporcine cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates can\nproduce CPB2, in this study we first evaluated whether our\ncollection of European horse GI disease isolates positive for\ncpb2 by PCR (cpb2 PCR-positive isolates) could, in fact,\nproduce CPB2. We first analyzed culture supernatant pro-\nteins from cpb2-positive C. perfringens. When CPB2 Western\nblotting was performed with supernatant proteins from a\ncontrol CPB2-producing C. perfringens pig isolate, CWC245\n(11), an \ufffd28-kDa immunoreactive band was obtained (Fig.\n1), consistent with previous reports (11, 29). However, no\nCPB2 production could be detected in the culture superna-\ntant of a cpb2-negative isolate, 106527 (data not shown).\n\nWhen similar CPB2 Western blot analyses were performed\non culture supernatant proteins prepared from our unknown\n23 horse GI disease isolates, no CPB2-specific immunoreactive\nband was detected (Table 1; representative results are shown\nin Fig. 1). To investigate whether this lack of CPB2 production\nin our surveyed cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates was due\nto impaired secretion of CPB2, we compared the production of\nCPB2 in culture supernatant with that in total cell protein\npreparations (Fig. 1) using CPB2 Western blotting analysis.\nAgain, no CPB2-specific immunoreactive band was observed in\nthe assays with either supernatant or total cell proteins of horse\nGI disease isolates (Fig. 1). These results suggested that all of\nour surveyed horse GI disease isolates were incapable of pro-\nducing detectable levels of CPB2.\n\nRFLP genotyping of cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates.

We first performed\nRFLP-Southern blot analysis on representative cpb2-positive\n(CWC245) and cpb2-negative (106527) C. perfringens isolates\nusing HpaI or EcoRV restriction enzymes which have no cleav-\nage site within the cpb2 ORF. As expected, a DIG-labeled cpb2\nprobe hybridized to an \ufffd5-kb HpaI or \ufffd7.5-kb EcoRV DNA\nfragment of CWC245, respectively (reference 29 and data not\nshown). However, no hybridizing band was observed with\nDNA from cpb2-negative isolate 106527 (Fig. 2).\n\nWhen the same HpaI RFLP-Southern blot assay was applied\nto our collection of horse GI disease isolates, the cpb2 probe\nhybridized to \ufffd20-kb HpaI DNA fragments from 21 out of 23\nsurveyed isolates (Table 1; representative results are shown in\nFig. 2). Two isolates, AHT2600 and AHT2779, produced hy-\nbridizing bands of \ufffd8 kb and \ufffd14 kb, respectively (Table 1 and\nFig. 2). In order to confirm that these differing HpaI RFLP\nresults were not simply due to the loss of an HpaI restriction\nsite, further RFLP analyses were performed on EcoRV-di-\ngested DNA (Fig. 2). These EcoRV RFLP results confirmed\nour HpaI RFLP results, demonstrating that the EcoRV RFLP\npatterns of these two isolates are different from that of the\nother surveyed horse GI disease isolates (Fig. 2). These results\nsuggest that all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates carry\nthe cpb2 sequences.\n\nPFGE evidence supporting the plasmid localization of cpb2\nin isolates from horses with GI diseases. To determine\nwhether cpb2 is located on the chromosome or plasmid in\nhorse GI disease isolates, representative cpb2-positive C. per-\nfringens isolates were subjected to PFGE-Southern blot anal-\nysis, which has been successfully used (4, 6, 7, 24, 29) to for-\nmally establish the chromosomal or plasmid localization of cpe\nand cpb2. As expected, the cpb2-containing DNA from control\nstrain CWC245 entered the pulsed-field gel in the absence of\n\nrestriction enzyme digestion and produced a hybridizing band\nof \ufffd50 kb (Fig. 3). These PFGE results confirmed previous\nobservations that cpb2 is located on the plasmid of cpb2-pos-\nitive isolate CWC245 (11, 29).\n\nWhen similar PFGE genotyping analyses were performed on\nDNA of representative cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates,\ntheir cpb2-containing plasmid DNA entered the pulsed-field\ngels and produced hybridizing bands that comigrated with the\ncpb2-containing plasmid DNA from CWC245 (Table 1; repre-\nsentative results are shown in Fig. 3). These results indicated\nthat the cpb2-positive C. perfringens horse GI disease isolates\ncarry cpb2 on a plasmid.\n\nComparison of the cpb2 ORFs present in different cpb2-\npositive horse GI disease isolates. To examine whether horse\nGI disease isolates carry intact cpb2 ORFs, both strands of a\n1,373-bp PCR-amplified DNA insert carrying the cpb2 ORFs\nfrom three different horse GI disease isolates were nucleotide\nsequenced. These analyses (data not shown) revealed that no\nframeshift mutations or premature termination codons were\nfound in the cpb2 ORF sequences of the horse GI disease\nisolates which we surveyed. The cpb2 ORF sequences present\nin horse GI disease isolates were identical to one another.\nFurthermore, the cpb2 ORF sequences present in three of\nthese isolates match the previously determined (11) cpb2 ORF\nsequence from CWC245 (a type C strain isolated from a dis-\neased pig in France) except for one nucleotide change. The\nreplacement of G with A at position 408 (from ATG) in cpb2\nORFs of surveyed horse GI disease isolates creates a replace-\nment of valine with isoleucine. These results suggest that our\nsurveyed three horse GI disease isolates carry a consensus, but\n\nFIG. 2. RFLP-Southern blot analysis of HpaI- or EcoRV-digested\nDNA from horse GI disease isolates. Total DNA isolated from each of\nthe specified C. perfringens strains was digested with HpaI (A) or\nEcoRV (B) and then Southern transferred. The Southern blots were\nprobed with a 318-bp DIG-labeled cpb2-specific probe. Results shown\nfor control isolates include those for 106527 (a cpb2-negative type C\nstrain).

Comparison of the cpb2 upstream\nand downstream sequences present in all three isolates re-\nvealed that both upstream and downstream sequences were\nidentical in all three horse GI disease isolates and matched the\npreviously determined cpb2 upstream and downstream se-\nquences of CWC245 (11).\n\nRT-PCR analysis of cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates.\nHaving obtained evidence for the presence of intact cpb2\nORFs in all of our surveyed CPB2 Western blotting-negative\nhorse GI disease isolates, we performed RT-PCR analyses to\nevaluate whether the cpb2 ORFs in these isolates were tran-\nscriptionally active. When control experiments were performed\nto confirm the specificity and reliability of the RT-PCR assay,\nno detectable RT-PCR-amplified product was observed with\nRNA of a cpb2-positive isolate, CWC245, in the absence of RT\n(Fig. 4A), indicating that no contaminating DNA was present\nin the RNA preparation. However, as expected, a 318-bp am-\nplified product was detected in RNA of CWC245 in the pres-\nence of RT (Fig. 4A). The size of the RT-PCR-amplified\nproduct exactly matched the size of the product obtained in the\ncontrol PCR using CWC245 chromosomal DNA as a template\nand the same primers (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that\nthe cpb2 mRNA is present in total RNA of CWC245.\n\nWhen the same RT-PCR analysis was applied to RNA from\nour four representative horse GI disease isolates (106902,\n106903, AHT327, and AHT3992), the 318-bp RT-dependent\namplified product was detected in total RNA of all four sur-\nveyed isolates (Fig. 4A and data not shown). The size of each\nRT-PCR-amplified product exactly matched the size of the\n\nPCR product obtained with DNA of each surveyed isolate\n(Fig. 4B and data not shown). These results suggest that the\nhorse GI disease isolates are able to produce cpb2-specific\ntranscripts and that the negative CPB2 production in these\nisolates may not be due to the transcriptional inactivation of\ncpb2.\n\nComparative Northern blot analysis of cpb2-positive horse\nGI disease isolates. After we demonstrated the presence of\ncpb2 transcripts in RNA of our surveyed isolates, it became of\ninterest to compare the level of cpb2 mRNA synthesis in CPB2\nWestern blotting-negative horse GI disease isolates with that\nin the CPB2-producing pig isolate CWC245 by Northern blot\nanalysis. As shown in Fig. 5, our cpb2-specific probe hybridized\nto an \ufffd1.2-kb mRNA species present in RNA samples ex-\ntracted from CWC245. The size of the CWC245 cpb2 tran-\nscript matched the size of the cpb2 transcript (\ufffd1.4 kb) from\nstrain 13 (22) and was in close agreement with the cpb2 coding\nsequence from CWC245 (10). However, as expected, this\nprobe showed no hybridization to RNA samples extracted\nfrom a cpb2-negative isolate, 106527 (Fig. 5), even though\nethidium bromide staining (data not shown) confirmed that\nequivalent amounts of RNA samples from both CWC245 and\n106527 had been electrophoresed. These results indicated that\nour Northern blot results were reliable and specific.\n\nWhen these Northern blot analyses were applied to RNA\nprepared from C. perfringens horse GI disease isolates, a single\n1.2-kb band, which comigrated with the cpb2 probe-reactive\nband of CWC245, was detected in RNA from all our surveyed\nisolates (Fig. 5 and Table 1). However, the expression of cpb2\nin horse GI disease isolates was significantly low compared to\nthat in pig isolate CWC245 (Fig. 5A). Over three experimental\nrepetitions, the 1.2-kb cpb2 probe-reactive species was repro-\nducibly less abundant in RNA samples extracted from our\nsurveyed horse GI disease isolates than in RNA samples ex-\ntracted from CWC245, possibly because these strains produced\ntoo little cpb2 message, as would be consistent with Western\nblotting results indicating no detectable CPB2 production by\nhorse GI disease isolates. Time course experiments demon-\nstrated that the maximal cpb2 transcription in 3-h growth cul-\ntures of both pig isolate CWC245 and horse isolate 106903 and\nthe transcription level gradually decreased over the time pe-\nriod. Although expression of cpb2 was continued up to 10 h in\nthe growth culture of CWC245, no cpb2 transcript could be\ndetected in the 106903 culture after 8 h (Fig. 5B). When the\nrelative cpb2 mRNA levels were determined by semiquantita-\ntive Northern blot analysis, an average difference of 35-fold in\ncpb2 transcription levels was observed between a pig strain\n(CWC245) producing high levels of CPB2 and five surveyed\nhorse GI disease strains (170, AHT327, AHT3992, 106902, and\n106903) producing undetectable levels of CPB2 (Fig. 5C and\ndata not shown). These results suggest that decreased tran-\nscription and/or message instability may be involved, at least in\npart, in the low CPB2 production levels noted for the horse GI\ndisease isolates compared with that for pig GI disease isolate\nCWC245.\n\nOverexpression of cpb2 in horse GI disease isolates 106902\nand 106903 by a recombinant plasmid carrying the cpb2 gene\nfrom 106902. To confirm that undetectable CPB2 production\nin horse GI disease isolates was due to low expression of cpb2\nmRNA, we introduced plasmid pMRS140, which is a deriva-\n\nFIG. 4.

When total RNA extracted from TGY cul-\ntures of either 106902(pMRS140) or 106903(pMRS140) was\nsubjected to Northern blot analyses, a single 1.2-kb cpb2\n\nprobe-specific band was detected (Fig. 5A and data not\nshown). The 1.2-kb cpb2 probe-reactive species was reproduc-\nibly more abundant in RNA samples extracted from\n106902(pMRS140) and 106903(pMRS140) than in RNA sam-\nples extracted from host strains 106902 and 106903, respec-\ntively (Fig. 5A and data not shown). There were no differences\nin the abundance of the 1.2-kb species in RNA samples ex-\ntracted from 106902(pMRS140), 106903(pMRS140), and\nCWC245 (Fig. 5A and data not shown). These results suggest\nthat the cpb2 gene present on the multicopy plasmid pMRS140\ncould overexpress cpb2 mRNA in 106902 and 106903.\n\nCPB2 Western blot analyses (Fig. 6) demonstrated that the\nplasmid pMRS140 could overproduce CPB2 in 106902 and\n106903. pMRS140 transformants were able to produce CPB2\nin a secretion-dependent manner reminiscent of CPB2 produc-\ntion by CWC245; that is, neither pMRS140 transformant pro-\nduced detectable CPB2-specific immunoreactivity in total cell\nproteins (data not shown), but the transformants did produce\nCPB2-specific immunoreactivity in culture supernatant pro-\nteins (Fig. 6). CPB2 Western blots also demonstrated, as ex-\npected, that CPB2 production (Fig. 6 and data not shown) was\nabsent from both total cell and culture supernatant proteins\nwhen the shuttle vector pJIR751 alone was introduced into\n106902 or 106903, confirming that the observed overproduc-\ntion of CPB2 in 106902(pMRS140) and 106903(pMRS140)\nwas specifically caused by transcomplementation of the wild-\ntype cpb2 gene present in pMRS140. Collectively, these results\nindicated that the cpb2 gene present in horse GI disease isolate\n106902 was functional and that there was a positive correlation\n\nFIG. 5.

(ii) Nucleotide sequencing\nidentified intact cpb2 ORFs in our surveyed CPB2 Western\nblotting-negative isolates. The cpb2 ORF sequences present in\nthree surveyed horse GI disease isolates are identical to one\nanother and to previously determined (11, 29) cpb2 ORF se-\nquences. (iii) Finally, complementation studies demonstrated\nthat a recombinant plasmid carrying 106902 cpb2 increased\nCPB2 production in 106902 cells to a detectable level (Fig. 6),\nindicating that the 106902 cpb2 gene is fully functional. Col-\nlectively, these results suggested that the differences in CPB2\nproduction levels observed between CWC245 and our sur-\nveyed horse GI disease isolates may be due to differences in\ncpb2 transcription levels.\n\nThe most significant finding of this study is the presentation\nof the first evidence that cpb2 is transcriptionally active in all of\nour surveyed CPB2 Western blotting-negative isolates and the\nobservation of an average of 35-fold-lower mRNA levels in\nhorse GI disease isolates than in pig GI disease isolate\nCWC245. This lower level of mRNA synthesis might be a\nmajor cause of the undetectability of CPB2 production in horse\nGI disease isolates. This idea received further support from\nour observation that the complementing strain\n106902(pMRS140), which produced significantly higher levels\nof mRNA than its parent strain, 106902 (Fig. 5A), produced\nCPB2 at a level similar to CWC245 (Fig. 6). These findings\nprovide a genetic basis, at least in part, for the lack of a\ndetectable level of CPB2 production in vitro in C. perfringens\nhorse GI disease isolates, which may also be applicable to\nother nonporcine isolates characterized previously (5), where\nonly 50% of cpb2-positive nonporcine isolates produced CPB2.\n\nOur complementation studies also suggest that there is a\npositive correlation between cpb2 transcription levels and the\namount of CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and that\ndecreased transcription and/or message instability may be in-\nvolved, at least in part, in the lower CPB2 production noted for\nthe horse GI disease isolates than for pig isolate CWC245. We\ndid not examine stabilities of cpb2 mRNAs and therefore can-\nnot rule out the possibility that the cpb2 mRNAs of horse GI\ndisease isolates are less stable than that of CWC245. However,\nno degraded cpb2 transcript was detected on the Northern blot\nof our surveyed isolates (Fig. 5), suggesting that the difference\nin CPB2 production levels in vitro between CWC245 and horse\nGI disease isolates may have arisen due to different rates of\ncpb2 transcription. The differential level of alpha-toxin gene\n(plc) transcription in C. perfringens was previously reported;\nthe levels of plc transcripts differ up to 40-fold from one C.\nperfringens type to another, and the greater production of al-\npha-toxin by the type A strains is due mainly to an increased\nlevel of plc transcripts (17, 28). Further transcriptional analyses\n\nof a large number of cpb2-positive type C isolates should ad-\ndress whether the difference in the levels of cpb2 transcription\nin CWC245 (type C pig strain) and horse GI disease isolates\n(type A) observed in our present study is typically due to\nisolates\u2019 type (type A versus type C) or origin (pig versus\nhorse).\n\nWhat could be responsible for the different rates of cpb2\ntranscription between CWC245 and horse GI disease isolates?\nAn inverted repeat sequence identified in the downstream\nregion of the CWC245 cpb2 sequence (11) is also present in\nour surveyed horse GI disease isolates. The cpb2 upstream\npromoter region is identical in both pig and horse isolates. The\n1,373-bp sequenced fragment does not contain any features\nwhich would account for different cpb2 expression levels be-\ntween pig strain CWC245 and surveyed horse GI disease iso-\nlates. Therefore, it can be envisioned that the relevant differ-\nence(s) might be present outside of this fragment and be\ninvolved in regulating cpb2 expression.\n\nThe association of cpb2-positive C. perfringens type A iso-\nlates with GI diseases in horses raises an important, but still\nunanswered, question. Is this low-level expression of cpb2\nenough to cause any GI symptoms of CPB2-associated GI\ndiseases, or do these symptoms also result from expression of\nother C. perfringens toxin(s)? Our present study does not rule\nout the possibility that these cpb2-positive type A horse GI\ndisease isolates acquire high-level expression of cpb2 in vivo,\nwhich could be enough to cause symptoms of CPB2-associated\nGI diseases in horses. All of the type A horse GI disease\nisolates surveyed in this study were classified as cpe-negative\ntype A isolates, indicating that the production of C. perfringens\nenterotoxin or beta-, iota-, or epsilon-toxin is not required for\na CPB2-producing type A isolate to cause GI diseases in\nhorses. Since the present study confirmed that cpb2-positive\ntype A horse GI disease isolates can produce both CPB2 and\nalpha-toxin, it is possible that alpha-toxin also can be a major\ncontributor to the pathogenesis of diseases caused by these\nisolates. Further CPB2 and alpha-toxin knockout studies\nshould address the relative contributions of CPB2 and alpha-\ntoxin in cpb2-positive C. perfringens type A-associated GI dis-\neases in animals.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was supported by a grant from the N.

While the biological\nfunction of maspin in blocking tumor invasion and metastasis is consistent with the loss of maspin expression at the late\nstage of tumor progression, the differential expression and the biological significance of maspin in early stage of tumor\nprogression appear to be complex and remain to be elucidated. In the current study, we examined the expression of maspin\nin 84 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases (stages I\u2013III) and 55 non-tumor adjacent esophageal tissue\nspecimens by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The correlation of maspin with clinicopathological parameters was\nanalyzed. Compared to normal esophageal squamous tissue where 80% (47/55) of the cases expressed maspin at a low to\nmoderate level, all ESCC specimens (100% (84/84)) were positive for maspin expression at a moderate to high level. ESCC\nwith low or moderate maspin expression had significantly shorter postoperative survival rates compared to those that had\nhigh maspin expression (p,0.001). Since the correlation of maspin with ESCC histology and the correlation of maspin with\nESCC prognosis seem to be at odds, we further investigated the biological function of maspin in ESCC using the established\nESCC cell lines. The expression of maspin in five human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines (T12, E450, KYSE150, EC109,\nand KYSE510) was examined by the Western blot. ESCC cell line KYSE510 that did not express maspin and was stably\ntransfected by maspin cDNA or an empty vector. The resulting transfected cells were characterized in vitro. Maspin\nexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, motility and matrigel invasion. Taken together, our data suggest that the\ntransient up-regulation of maspin in the early development of ESCC may be a defense mechanism against further transition\ntowards more malignant phenotypes, ultimately slowing down ESCC tumor progression.\n\nCitation: Wang Y, Sheng S, Zhang J, Dzinic S, Li S, et al.

The two main subtypes of\n\nesophageal carcinoma are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell\n\ncarcinoma (ESCC), while the most commonly diagnosed esoph-\n\nageal cancer in China and other Asian countries is ESCC [3,4].\n\nDespite the rapid advancement in combined chemotherapy and\n\nradiation therapy for ESCC, the average 5-year overall survival\n\nhas remained steady at 10\u201320% [2,5,6]. Unfortunately, the\n\nprediction of clinical prognosis of patients with ESCC based on\n\nconventional pathological variables, such as the tumor size, tumor\n\ngrade, and the tumor stage is highly empirical [7\u20139]. Specific\n\nbiomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the progression of\n\nESCC may significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction of\n\npatients\u2019 survival. To this end, it is important to note that many of\n\nthe molecular markers that are associated with specific patholog-\n\nical grades (diagnosis) have failed to serve as prognostic markers. It\n\nis well appreciated that tumor progression is a continuum of\n\ndynamic molecular and cellular changes. The link of a molecular\n\nprofile with a phenotype may not reflect whether the former is\n\ndriver or a passenger of the latter, and may not predict whether\n\nthis association is consequential for further tumor progression.\n\nSome molecular changes may be suppressive steps that may\n\neventually give way to the predominant oncogenic changes. The\n\ncapacity of tumor cells to turn on tumor suppressive mechanisms,\n\neven though transitory, may translate into delayed tumor\n\nprogression, and prolonged patients\u2019 survival.\n\nMaspin is an epithelial-specific tumor suppressor that is\n\ndifferentially regulated during tumor progression. It is a member\n\nof the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily [10] but with\n\nfunctions that are deviant from those of classical serine protease-\n\ninhibiting serpins. Accumulated evidence suggests that maspin\n\nmay play a key role in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis\n\nby blocking serine protease-like enzymes such as the zymogen\n\nform of urokinase-type plasminogen activator [11,12] and histone\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581\n\n\n\ndeacetylase 1 [13]. Consistent with its anti-invasion and anti-\n\nmetastasis properties, maspin expression is found to be down\n\nregulated in the progression of many types of cancer at the step of\n\ntumor invasion and metastasis.\n\nAs a tumor suppressor, maspin is not immediately down-\n\nregulated in the early development of cancer. In fact, accumulated\n\nevidence demonstrates a transient up-regulation of maspin in non-\n\ninvasive cancer of breast [14,15], ovary [16], and pancreas\n\n[17,18]. In adenocarcinomas, this up-regulation of maspin is also\n\nassociated with its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n\nIn squamous cell carcinomas, however, maspin is always\n\ndistributed to both nucleus and cytoplasm. The biological\n\nsignificance of these distinct differential patterns is a subject of\n\ncurrent investigation. Based on our earlier studies, the transloca-\n\ntion of maspin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in early stage\n\nadenocarcinoma correlates with significantly better survival of\n\nlung cancer [19]. On the other hand, elevated maspin expression\n\nin early stage squamous cell carcinoma both, nuclear and\n\ncytosolic, correlates with significantly better survival of oral\n\nsquamous cell carcinoma [20]. These data suggest that the\n\nprognosis of cancer subtypes may be distinctly stratified based on\n\nmaspin differential expression.\n\nIn this paper, we report the first clinical evidence that maspin\n\nwas significantly elevated in a subpopulation of stage I-III ESCC\n\nspecimens. The level of maspin expression correlated with better\n\noverall survival of ESCC patients. We further investigated the\n\nbiological function of maspin using established ESCC cell lines\n\nand showed an inhibitory effect of maspin on cell proliferation,\n\nmotility, and invasion. These data suggest that ESCC with an\n\nability to up-regulate maspin may be protected against further\n\nmalignant progression.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nTissue Specimens\nThis research involves 84 archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-\n\nembedded human stage I\u2013III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma\n\n(ESCC) tissue specimens, from patients who were eligible for and\n\nunderwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007 at the\n\nDepartment of Surgery, Beijing Cancer Hospital (China). In\n\naddition, tumor-adjacent normal tissue specimens were collected\n\nfrom 55 of these patients. Prior to the tissue collection, the clinical\n\nprotocol was approved by the ethics review board of Peking\n\nUniversity Health Sciences Center. Informed written consents\n\nwere obtained from the patients. The consents were saved as\n\nscanned PDF files, and saved in patients\u2019 records. The samples\n\nwere de-identified to the research group. The 84 patients included\n\n64 men and 20 women with a median age of 58 years (ranging\n\nfrom 43 to 73 years).\n\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) Staining\nTissue sections on slides of 5 mm thickness were subjected to\n\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and IHC staining of\n\nmaspin as described previously [16]. Monoclonal antibody against\n\nmaspin (clone G167\u201370; Pharmingen/BD Bioscience, San Diego,\n\nCA) was diluted 100-fold. The horse-reddish peroxidase (HRP)\n\nconjugated secondary antibody (Dako Cytomation, Cambridge-\n\nshire, UK) was detected by chromogenic reaction of HRP. For\n\nnegative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. The tissue\n\nsections were examined and scored independently by the two\n\npathologists who had no prior knowledge of the study aim or\n\ndesign. Maspin expression was semi-quantitatively evaluated by\n\nthe percentage of maspin positive cells and the intensity of maspin\n\nstaining on the scale of 0\u20133. The percentage of positive cells was\n\ncategorically scored as following: 0 points (maspin positive in 0\u2013\n\n5% of cells); 2 points (maspin positive in 6\u201350% of cells); 3 points\n\n(maspin positive in .50% of cells). The staining intensity was\n\ncategorically scored as follows: 1 point: negative or weak staining;\n\n2 points: moderate staining; 3 points: strong staining. The overall\n\nmaspin expression (OMS) was calculated as the sum of the\n\npercentage category points and the intensity category points in\n\neach case. Tumors were categorized into four groups: negative:\n\n#5% of cells stained, regardless of intensity; weak expression\n\n(OMS: 0\u20132 points); moderate expression (OMS: 3\u20134 points); and\n\nstrong expression (OMS: 5\u20136 points). Maspin sub-cellular pattern\n\nof nuclear staining and cytoplasmic staining were assessed semi-\n\nquantitatively on the basis of the percentage of positive cells, as\n\ndescribed previously [21]. Maspin nuclear immunoreactivity was\n\ndefined as stronger nuclear staining than cytoplasmic staining in at\n\nleast 10% of tumor cells. Maspin cytoplasmic immunoreactivity\n\nwas defined as stronger cytoplasmic staining than nuclear staining\n\nin at least 10% of tumor cells.\n\nCell Lines and Cell Culture\nFive human ESCC cell lines (KYSE-510, KYSE-150, T12,\n\nE450 and EC-109) were purchased from Institute of Basic Medical\n\nSciences Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences\u2019 cell culture center\n\n(Beijing, China). The cells were maintained at 37uC and 5% CO2\nin RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, US) supplemented with 10%\n\nheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-\n\nstreptomycin.\n\nWestern Blotting\nCells were lysed with 16 RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute of\n\nBiotechnology, Nantong, China) containing 25 mg/mL leupeptin\n(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg/mL aprotinin\n(Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells were removed from the dishes by cell\n\nscraping. The samples were then subjected to three cycles of\n\nfreeze-thaw and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The\n\nprotein concentration of the samples was determined using a\n\nbicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Reagent kit, and whole cell\n\nlysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a\n\npolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was\n\nblocked in 5% skim milk for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) and\n\nthen probed with primary antibodies against maspin (1:500\n\ndiluted) and a-actin (from SIGMA, 1:10,000 diluted), respectively.\nThe HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at\n\n1:2,500 dilutions. The bound secondary antibody was detected by\n\nchemiluminescence reaction (Millipore, Bedford, USA) and\n\nvisualized by radiography.\n\nStable Transfection\nSequence-verified maspin cDNA cloned into a vector for\n\nexpression in mammalian cells [22] was used to transfect\n\napproximately 60% confluent KYSE-510 using the Lipofectami-\n\nneTM 2000 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The empty vector DNA\n\nwas used in parallel transfection as a negative control. For clonal\n\nselection, 24 hrs after transfection, G418 was added to the culture\n\nmedium at the concentration of 400 mg/mL. The cells were\nmaintained in G418-containing medium for the next 4 weeks until\n\nindividual clones were selected. The selected clones were\n\nsubsequently maintained in the medium containing 200 mg/mL\nof G418.\n\nCell Proliferation Assay\nTo determine the effect of maspin on cell proliferation, cells\n\nwith and without maspin were seeded into 96-well plate at a\n\nMaspin and ESCC Prognosis\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581\n\n\n\ndensity of 46103/well/200 mL in the maintenance medium.\nViable cells were quantified at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours (h) after\n\nthe seeding by the chromogenic 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-\n\ndiphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay according to the\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instruction (Sigma, St. Louis, US). Each assay\n\nwas performed in triplicates and repeated 3 times.\n\nColony Formation Assay\nCells seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 400 cells/well/\n\nmedium volume, were allowed to grow for 10 days to form\n\ncolonies. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and treated with\n\nGiemsa for 10 min, and then photographed with a digital camera\n\n(OLYMPUS, SP350). The number of colonies and the number of\n\ncells in each colony was counted under the microscopy. The\n\ncolonies which had more than 100 cells were defined as big\n\ncolonies.\n\nWound-healing Assay\nThe cells were added to six-well plates, allowed to form\n\nconfluent monolayers and were serum starved overnight. An\n\nartificial wound was created in the cell monolayer with a sterile\n\nplastic 200 mL micropipette tip to generate one homogeneous\nwound in each well. After wounding, the culture medium was\n\nremoved, and cells were washed at least twice to eliminate\n\ndetached cells. Wound closure was photographed at 0, 6, 12, and\n\n24 h after wounding. Images of cells from the same field were\n\nacquired at the indicated time points, using an inverted\n\nmicroscope equipped with a digital camera. The number of cells\n\nin each colony was counted under microscope. Each measurement\n\nwas performed in triplicate.\n\nMatrigel Invasion Assay\nInvasion assay was performed using 8 mm PET pore size\n\nmembrane coated with Matrigel (24-well, BD Biosciences, Bed-\n\nford, MA). Cells were seeded at 26105 cells per 500 mL of growth\nmedium on the Matrigel-coated membrane. The bottom wells\n\nwere filled with the maintenance culture medium, and the\n\nchambers were incubated at 37uC in a humidified 5% CO2. After\n24 h, the Matrigel and non-invading cells in the upper chamber\n\nwere removed by scraping. The cells on the bottom side of the\n\nmembrane (invading cells) were stained with 1% crystal violet and\n\ncounted under the microscope. Each experiment was performed in\n\ntriplicate.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nClinicopathological factors were analyzed separately using the\n\nchi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate\n\nthe patient survival and the log-rank test was used to determine the\n\nstatistical significance. The associations between discrete variables\n\nwere assessed using the chi-square test. All data were expressed as\n\nthe mean 6 standard deviation. A p-value of less than 0.05 was\n\nconsidered to be statistically significant. Statistical calculations\n\nwere performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences\n\nsoftware version 11.0 (SPSS11.0).\n\nResults\n\nDifferential Maspin Expression in Human ESCC and\nNormal Adjacent Tissues\n\nTo investigate whether the level or subcellular localization of\n\nmaspin helps predict the survival of ESCC patients, ESCC tissues\n\nwere collected from 84 stage I-III patients who were eligible for\n\nand underwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007. These\n\npatients were followed up for at least 5 years. IHC was performed\n\nto examine the expression of maspin in these tumor specimens, as\n\nwell as 55 tumor-adjacent normal tissues, and the level of maspin\n\nexpression was semi-quantified using the method described in the\n\nMaterials and Methods section. Representative results are shown\n\nin Figure 1. As summarized in Table 1, among 55 cases of\nnormal esophageal tissues, the positive immunoreactivity was\n\nassociated with 85% of cases (47/55). The 8 patients had no\n\nmaspin immunoreactivity, 37 cases had weak maspin staining, and\n\n10 cases were associated with strong maspin staining. In contrast,\n\nall 84 ESCC specimens showed positive maspin staining. 33 tumor\n\nspecimens were associated with weak maspin staining, whereas 51\n\ncases had strong maspin staining. Overall, as compared to the\n\ncorresponding normal esophageal tissues, ESCC tissues exhibited\n\nstronger maspin IHC signals and a higher percentage of maspin-\n\nstrong cells (p,0.001).\n\nBased on the overall maspin expression, all the tumor specimens\n\ncan be divided by the total level of maspin expression (low/\n\nmoderate vs. strong), the level of nuclear maspin (weak/moderate\n\nvs. strong), and the level of cytoplasmic maspin (weak/moderate\n\nvs. strong). The stratification of these different groups with\n\nclinicopatholoigcal variables was evaluated. As summarized in\n\nTable 2, there was no significant difference between the groups\nwith respect to sex, age, pathologic grade and tumor stage. In\n\naddition, we also analyzed the association between subcellular\n\nlocalization of maspin and clinicopathological variables. Even\n\nthough not statistically significant, we observed the following\n\ntrends: poorly differentiated tumors were associated with weaker\n\nnuclear maspin staining and stronger cytoplasmic maspin staining.\n\nIn addition, the lymph node metastasis was associated with a\n\nhigher level of cytoplasmic maspin staining as compared to lymph\n\nnode negative patients.\n\nMaspin Expression Correlates with Better Overall\nPostoperative Survival\n\nOur cohort of ESCC patients were followed up for at least 5\n\nyears, as of March 2012, with a median survival of 36.5 months. In\n\norder to test if maspin expression is associated with increased or\n\ndecreased patient survival, patients were classified into two groups,\n\nthose with strong maspin expression (51 cases, OMS 5\u20136) or those\n\nwith weak and moderate maspin expression (33 cases, OMS 2\u20134).\n\nThe corresponding median survival time for these two groups were\n\n45611.1 months and 1962.9 months, respectively, demonstrating\n\nthat stronger maspin expression is associated with significantly\n\nincreased patient survival and favorable prognosis. (Figure 2A,\nlog-rank, p = 0.009). Since previous reports in breast [23] and lung\n\ncancer [19] for example, suggest that nuclear maspin is associated\n\nwith better overall patient survival, we also investigated whether\n\nmaspin subcellular localization correlated with the overall survival.\n\nFor this purpose, the patients were classified into two correspond-\n\ning groups: predominantly nuclear expression or predominantly\n\ncytoplasmic expression patients. Although the p value did not\n\nreach a significant difference, stronger expression of maspin in the\n\nnucleus was still associated with a more favorable patient prognosis\n\n(4469.5 months vs. 2164.5 months; p = 0.051) (Figures 2B and\n2C). In general, maspin expression level correlated with less tumor\nlocal invasion. We also observed a trend for the negative\n\ncorrelation between maspin expression and lymph node metastasis\n\n(Table 2). In addition, reduced nuclear maspin and increased\ncytoplasmic maspin were associated with lymph node metastasis.\n\nAlthough these data did not reach statistical significance, in part\n\nlimited by the number of patients, they are consistent with the\n\nnotion that the mortality of these ESCC patients result primarily\n\nfrom metastasis.\n\nMaspin and ESCC Prognosis\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581\n\n\n\nMaspin Expressed in ESCC Cell Lines is Tumor\nSuppressive\n\nEstablished ESCC cell lines offer a valuable experimental model\n\nto study the progression and underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nSimilar to the observation with early stage ESCC specimens, the\n\nlevel of maspin was not significantly altered in ESCC cell lines that\n\nare only weakly or moderately aggressive (T12, E450, KYSE150,\n\nand EC109) [24], as judged by Western blotting (Figure 3A).\nHowever, ESCC cell line KYSE510 that was significantly more\n\ninvasive and grew at a faster rate had lost maspin expression\n\n(Figure 3B).\n\nTo investigate the functional significance of maspin in ESCC,\n\nwe took the advantage of KYSE510 cell line that did not express\n\nmaspin and stably transfected the cells with maspin-encoding\n\npCMV-Tag2-maspin vector or an empty vector pCMV-Tag2.\n\nThe maspin expression in the resulting maspin transfected cells\n\n(M-KYSE510) and the mock transfected control (V-KYSE510) are\n\nshown in Figure 4A. As shown in Figure 4B, maspin expression\ncorrelated with decreased cell proliferation as judged by the MTT\n\nassay. Earlier, it was reported that maspin regulated cell\n\nattachment and detachment [13,25]. To determine whether the\n\neffect of maspin expression on tumor growth was a result of altered\n\ncolonization, cells were suspended and seeded at a low density in\n\ncell culture dish. The number of the single cell-derived colonies\n\nand number of cells per colony were evaluated under the\n\nmicroscope. Maspin expression did not significantly alter the\n\ncolony forming ability, for the colony numbers for M-KYSE510,\n\nV-KYSE510 and the parental cells were not significantly different\n\n(data not shown). However, as shown in Figure 4C, the size of M-\n\nKYSE510 colonies was significantly smaller compared to those\n\nderived fromV-KYSE510 cell line. Consistently, the number of\n\ncells per colony was significantly lower than those for V-KYSE510\n\nand parental cells. The number of colonies of M-KYSE510 with\n\nmore than 100 cells was approximately a half of those of V-\n\nKYSE510 or parental KYSE510cells (p,0.01, Figure 4D).\n\nTo further investigate whether the presence of maspin in ESCC\n\nis a gain or loss of other functions in tumor progression, we\n\nexamined the effect of maspin expression on tumor cell motility\n\nand invasion. As shown by the in vitro wound healing assay\n\n(Figure 5A), The M-KYSE-510 displayed a significantly attenu-\nated rate of wound healing as compared to V-KYSE-510 or\n\nparental KYSE-510 cells. Moreover, as compared to V-KYSE-\n\n510 or parental KYSE-510 cells, M-KYSE-510 exhibited a\n\nsignificantly lower capacity to migrate through the Matrigel-\n\ncoated transwell membrane in the in vitro invasion assay (p,0.01,\n\nFigures 5B and 5C).\n\nAlthough the level of maspin correlated with the overall\n\nsurvival, the biological function and underlying molecular\n\nmechanisms of maspin may not be as simple. The effects of\n\nmaspin may further depend on tumor microenvironments. In\n\naddition to reducing the proliferative activity and invasive\n\npotential, maspin may also prevent tumor angiogenesis through\n\nepigenetic regulation [26\u201330].\n\nEarlier we have shown that maspin may directly inhibit cell\n\nsurface-associated uPA to block tumor cell detachment\n\n[12,26,31,32]. Data from the Hendrix Laboratory [33] and our\n\nlaboratory [29] further suggest that maspin may down-regulate the\n\nexpression of uPA. To test whether the effect of maspin on the\n\nFigure 1.

Considering\n\nthe differences between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocar-\n\ncinoma, the underlying mechanism for the inhibitory effects of\n\nmaspin on ESCC invasion may not be identical to that in\n\ncarcinoma cells of breast and prostate origin. To date, there is no\n\nclinical consensus about uPA as a prognostic marker for ESCC.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe challenge for clinicians and oncologists in terms of patient\n\npersonalized medicine and plan for treatment is that early stage\n\ntumors with similar histopathological features may subsequently\n\ndisplay dramatically different outcome. In this paper, we described\n\nthe first evidence that tumor suppressor maspin expression in early\n\nstage ESCC positively correlated with overall postoperative\n\nsurvival of patients. In light of our in vitro data that maspin\n\ninhibits tumor growth and blocks tumor invasion, several\n\nimportant observations with human specimens suggest a unique\n\nvalue of maspin as a molecular prognostic marker of ESCC.\n\nOverall, our data support a hypothetical model (Figure 6) that\nhelps explain the correlation between maspin up-regulation and\n\nbetter overall survival of patients with ESCC. Based on this model,\n\nmaspin is expressed in early stage ESCC to retain the epithelial\n\nhomeostasis. In the absence of oncogenic changes, a basal level of\n\nmaspin expression is maintained in normal or benign squamous\n\nepithelial cells to counter incidental stress and transformation\n\ninsults. Upon the transformation and other oncogenic changes, the\n\nbasal level of maspin expression may not be sufficient to counter-\n\nbalance the biological effects of oncogenes. Those epithelial cells\n\nthat are still capable of up-regulating maspin expression will\n\nremain better differentiated with low potential to invade and\n\nmetastasize. The balance will shift towards more malignant\n\nphenotypes in those cells that are not capable of up-regulating\n\nmaspin or would eventually lose maspin expression. In contrast to\n\nmolecular markers whose differential expression patterns com-\n\npletely coincide with histopathological features, early stage ESCC\n\ncells expressing maspin at different levels may be histologically\n\nTable 2.

The usefulness of maspin differential expression may not\n\nbe to confirm pathological diagnosis. Rather, maspin may be\n\nuniquely useful as an independent marker to predict the course of\n\nthe disease progression.\n\nMaspin is an epithelial-specific protein. We did not detect\n\nspecific maspin antigen by immunohistochemistry in stromal\n\ncomponents in human ESCC specimens. Clinical studies to\n\ncorrelate maspin and tumor progression have been mostly\n\nconducted with adenocarcinoma, which is thought to be of\n\nglandular epithelial origin. Together with our current study, there\n\nare only two reports on how maspin expression correlates with the\n\nprogression of squamous cell carcinoma, which derives from\n\nstratified squamous epithelial cells. The reported data with oral\n\nsquamous cell carcinoma [20,34] share the following important\n\nsimilarities with our current study with ESCC: (i) both studies were\n\nconducted with surgically resected early stage tumor specimens; (ii)\n\nin both cases, maspin protein was detected in almost all tumor\n\ncells, and was overexpressed in some tumor cells; (iii) maspin\n\nprotein was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm; and (iv)\n\nthe overall maspin expression levels correlated with better survival\n\nof the patients. In comparison, a distinct maspin differential\n\nexpression patter is observed in adenocarcinoma. Studies with\n\ntissue specimens from breast [35,36], prostate [37], and lung [19]\n\nadenocarcinoma showed that maspin is predominantly a nuclear\n\nprotein in benign epithelial cells. Pre-neoplastic lesions and early\n\nstage carcinomas are commonly associated with elevated level of\n\nmaspin, which is localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm [19,35].\n\nIn invasive and metastatic carcinoma maspin expression is down-\n\nregulated or lost [38\u201340]. To our knowledge, maspin is the only\n\nmolecular marker that displays distinct differential expression\n\npatterns in the progression of different subtypes of carcinoma.\n\nFigure 3.

Thus, tumor suppressor genes that are mecha-\n\nnistically involved in tumor progression may be more insightful\n\nmolecular markers for diagnosis or prediction of prognosis. A\n\nparadigm based on the studies of classic tumor suppressor genes\n\nwhose loss or mutation at the genetic level contributes to\n\ncarcinogenesis and tumor progression would predict that tumor\n\nsuppressors would be down-regulated as long as the oncogenesis is\n\ninitiated [42]. Therefore, the tumor suppressive functions of\n\nmaspin may seem to be at odds with the observation that maspin is\n\nactually transiently up-regulated in some cells that have already\n\nacquired the histopathologic features of tumor cells. To this end, it\n\nis important to point out that maspin is primarily regulated at the\n\nlevel of expression and trafficking. Although maspin is not as\n\nfrequently mutated as some other well-known tumor suppressor\n\ngenes such as p53 [43], a specific Ser176RPro polymorphism has\nbeen identified [44] which seems to be frequent in gastric cancer\n\nand had reduced tumor suppressive potency as compared to the\n\nwild type maspin.\n\nIn vitro data from this study are in line with the consensus that\n\nmaspin exerts multifaceted anti-tumor effects, inhibiting tumor\n\ngrowth, motility, invasion, and sensitizing tumor cells to drug-\n\ninduced apoptosis. Maspin may be a nuclear, cytoplasmic, cell\n\nmembrane-associated, as well as secreted molecule. The multifac-\n\neted biological activities of maspin may be coordinated by its\n\nmolecular partnerships and subcellular localization [45\u201347]. To\n\nthis end, the Sheng laboratory was the first to report that (i)\n\nsecreted endogenous maspin binds and inhibits single-chain tissue\n\ntype plasminogen activator (sc-tPA, a zymogen) that is bound to\n\nfibrin or fibrinogen [48], (ii) extracellular maspin specifically binds\n\nand inhibits pro-urokinase type plasminogen activator (pro-uPA, a\n\nzymogen) that is associated with cell surface-anchored uPA\n\nreceptor (uPAR) [32] and (iii) intracellular maspin specifically\n\ninteracts and inhibits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) [13]. While\n\nthe specific molecular mode of action of cytoplasmic maspin is\n\nunder investigation in our lab, and earlier report suggested that\n\ncytoplasmic maspin regulates the Rho/Rac signaling network and\n\nblock tumor cell motility [49]. It is likely that endogenous targets of\n\nmaspin may be molecular targets for cancer therapy.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: YW SS JZ SL FF NW QZ YY.\n\nPerformed the experiments: YW JZ SL FF NW QZ YY.

Previously, we reported a marked increase in Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activity in human dermal psoriatic\nfibroblasts. As retinoic acid (RA) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and a mechanism for its beneficial effects is not\n\nunderstood, we investigated the effects of RA on SOD mRNA and protein expression levels in human normal and psoriatic\nfibroblasts. Prior to RA exposure, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were similar in normal compared to psoriatic fibroblasts\nwhile Mn-SOD protein and mRNA levels were increased in psoriatic cells. However, in contrast to normal fibroblasts, exposure of\n\npsoriatic fibroblasts to 1 mM RA down-regulated Mn-SOD mRNA, and also decreased Mn-SOD activity by w80% with no change\nin Mn-SOD protein levels. In contrast, Cu,Zn-SOD protein and enzymatic activity were modestly reduced by RA treatment in both\nnormal and psoriatic fibroblasts. Furthermore, RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD steady-\n\nstate mRNA levels. These results indicate that RA can serve as a regulatory agent to down-regulate the steady-state levels of both\nMn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD in psoriatic cells. These findings offer a new model for the antiinflammatory activity of RA when used in\nthe treatment of psoriasis.\n\n\ufffd 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nStudies to define the role of superoxide radicals (O2c\n\ufffd)\n\nin both physiological and pathological processes are an\narea of active investigation. Reactive oxygen species\n(ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide\nradicals and hydroxyl radicals are generated in cells in\nresponse to stimulation by various hormones, growth\nfactors and cytokines [1], such as PDGF [2,3]. The\n\nmailto:raynaud@vjf.cnrs.fr\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/08968411\n\n\n70 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\noxygen radicals generated appear to act as second\nmessengers in transmembrane signaling pathways and\nmodulate cellular functions such as cell proliferation,\ndifferentiation, and apoptosis [3]. Oxidative regulation\nof several key enzymes involved in cellular signal\ntransduction, including protein kinases, has been de-\nscribed [4].\n\nOxidants also have been implicated in a number of\npathological disorders, including Alzheimer disease,\npsoriasis, aging, atherosclerosis, and cancer [5e8]. The\nprimary cellular defenses against damage that can be\ncaused by O2c\n\n\ufffd and by its reactive progeny are the\nsuperoxide dismutases (SODs). Mammalian cells have\na mitochondrial Mn-SOD, a cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD\n(also found in peroxysomes) and an extracellular SOD\nwhich is a Cu,Zn-SOD that is immunologically distinct\nfrom the classical Cu,Zn-SOD [9]. These metalloen-\nzymes act to dismute toxic superoxide radicals to oxygen\nand H2O2[9e11]. Catalase, along with peroxidases such\nas glutathione peroxide, in turn catalyze the decompo-\nsition of H2O2 to water and oxygen. Studies have been\nongoing for a number of years in our laboratories on the\nsynergism between retinoic acid and cyclic AMP that\nregulates cell growth and differentiation [12]. In the\ncourse of these studies, it was established that cyclic\nAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity, as well\nas 8-azido-[32P] cAMP binding to the RI and RII\nregulatory subunits, are decreased in cells of psoriatic\npatients compared to cells of normal subjects [13]. More\nrecent studies determined that exposure of normal\nhuman dermal fibroblasts to H2O2 and to other oxygen\nfree radical generating systems decreased both PKA\nactivity and cyclic AMP binding to RI and RII, to levels\nsimilar to those observed with psoriatic fibroblasts [14].\nTreatment of psoriatic fibroblasts with free radical\nscavenging agents restored the ability of RI and RII to\nbind cyclic AMP toward normal levels. We also showed\nthat SOD activity, particularly that of the mitochondrial\nenzyme, Mn-SOD, was elevated in fibroblasts prepared\nfrom a psoriatic patient [15]. These results suggested\nthat oxidative modification may serve as a mechanism to\nalter PKA in human cells, and that an altered oxidative\nstate may be responsible for the decrease in PKA\nactivity and cyclic AMP binding in cells from psoriatic\npatients.\n\nRetinoic acid derivatives have been used with some\nsuccess in the therapeutic treatment of psoriasis even\nthough the mechanism of retinoid action responsible for\nthis beneficial effect was not known [16,17]. Previously,\nwe established that the treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts\nwith retinoic acid and with other retinoids, such as 13-\ncis-retinoic acid and arotinoid induced an increase in the\noxidatively modified PKA activity back towards normal\nlevels [13]. Again however, the mechanism by which\nretinoic acid acted to increase PKA activity in psoriatic\ncells remained to be elucidated. Thus, the present studies\nwere carried out to determine if retinoic acid treatment\nmight differentially regulate antioxidant enzyme activi-\nties in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts. To address this\nquestion Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD functional activi-\nties, as well as Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA levels\nand protein levels, were determined in cells in the\npresence and absence of retinoic acid. Retinoid treat-\nment of psoriatic fibroblasts was observed to signifi-\ncantly decrease both Mn-SOD activity and steady-state\nmRNA levels as well as both Cu,Zn-SOD expression\nand enzymatic activity.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Experimental reagents\n\nRetinoic acid (RA) and actinomycin D (ActD) were\nobtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MI, USA) and\ncycloheximide was purchased from Calbiochem (La\nJolla, CA, USA). ActD was dissolved in dimethylsulf-\noxide (Me2SO). RA was dissolved in 100% ethanol and\ncycloheximide in double distilled water (ddH2O).\nDMEM with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, fetal\nbovine serum and antibiotics were obtained from\nInvitrogen. The antibody to b-actin was an anti-mouse\nmonoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma. The rabbit\nanti-human Mn-SOD antibody and the goat anti-\nhuman Cu,Zn-SOD antibody were gifts of Dr\nN. Taniguchi, Osaka, Japan. The horseradish peroxi-\ndase-labelled secondary antibody was obtained from\nJackson Immunoresearch. Protein assay reagents and\npolyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchased\nfrom Bio-Rad (Marnes la Coquette, France).\n\n2.2. Cells\n\nHuman fibroblasts were isolated from seven normal\nand seven untreated adult psoriatic patients (Psoriasis\nvulgaris in flare for approximately 3 months) by\nenzymatic digestion of small pieces (4 mm) of lesional\nand non-lesional buttock and abdominal skin punch\nbiopsies as previously described [14,18]. These Caucasian\nsubjects were age- and sex-matched. This study was\napproved by the ethical committee of the Ho\u0302pital Cochin\n(Paris). The patients had received no systemic therapy\nsuch as corticosteroids, antimitotic drugs, retinoids for\nat least a year before the study; no systemic anti-\ninflammatory drugs for at least two weeks before the\nbiopsy; no local corticosteroids, ultraviolet light, or oral\npsoralen for at least three months before the assay. The\nseverity of the disease was determined by mean psoriatic\narea and severity index (PASI)score, as described by\nFrederiksson and Peterssonn [45]. The PASI score for\nthe 10 patients were 22.54G0.47 (Range 12.8e34.1).\nCells were grown as previously described [14] and used\n\n\n\n71P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nsubconfluent (106 cells/dish) at the fifth passage. All data\nwere obtained with cells propagated for the same number\nof passages (fifth passage) under identical culture\nconditions. For each donor the different assays were\nperformed on the same cell extracts prepared from cells\narising from the same cell seeding.\n\n2.3. Preparation of cellular fractions\n\nFibroblasts were washed three times with ice cold\nphosphate buffered saline and harvested by scraping\ninto ice cold buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2,\n20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) with a cell scraper with anti-\nproteolytics. The cells were recovered by centrifugation\nat 1000g for 5 min and the cell pellet was then frozen at\n\ufffd80 \ufffdC. For antioxidant enzyme activity measurements,\nthe control and psoriatic cell pellets were disrupted by\nsonication in 500 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer,\npH 7, (whole cell lysates), and the same cellular sample\nwas used to assay each of the indicated activities within\nthe same experiment.\n\n2.4. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities\n\nAs previously described [15], xanthineexanthine\noxidase was used to generate an O2c\n\n\ufffd flux and the\nreduction of 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5 phe-\nnyltetrazolium chloride (INT) to red formazan by O2c\n\n\ufffd\n\nwas followed at 505 nm, 30 \ufffdC. Each assay tube\ncontained 50 mM (3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane-sul-\nfonic acid) (CAPS) buffer, pH 10.2, for determination of\nCu,Zn-SOD activity [19], or 50 mM phosphate buffer,\npH 7.8, for determination of total SOD activity [20],\nalong with 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM INT, 50 mM xanthine,\n1 U/ml catalase, 0.05 mM bathocuproin disulfonate\ndisodium salt (BCS), 0.13 mg/ml bovine serum albumin\n(BSA), and enough xanthine oxidase to achieve the\nrequired 100% of non-inhibition. BCS and BSA were\nadded to inhibit non-enzymatic scavenging of O2c\n\n\ufffd. Mn-\nSOD activity was determined by adding cyanide (2 mM)\nto the assay mixture at pH 7.8 to inhibit Cu,Zn-SOD\nactivity, or was determined by subtracting the Cu,Zn-\nSOD activity determined at pH 10.2 from the total SOD\nactivity measured at pH 7.8. The two methods gave\nsimilar values (data not shown). All data are expressed\nin units of SOD activity per mg of protein.\n\n2.5. Western blot analysis\n\nCell pellets were prepared as described above. Then\ncell lysates were prepared, protein levels were de-\ntermined and the lysates were then heated for 5 min at\n95 \ufffdC in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by\nelectrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels (10 mg/\nsample). Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellu-\nlose and Western blots were performed as described in\nthe Supersignal kit (Pierce, Bezons, France). The SOD\nproteins were detected with a rabbit anti-human Mn-\nSOD antibody and a goat anti-human Cu,Zn-SOD\nantibody, both diluted 1000-fold (gift of Dr Taniguchi\nN., Osaka, Japan).\n\n2.6. Actinomycin D treatment\n\nTo determine the stability of Cu,Zn- and Mn-SOD\nmRNA, with or without retinoic acid (1 mM), the three\ndifferent types (normal, non-lesional and lesional\npsoriatic) of human fibroblast primary cultures were\nuntreated or treated for 48 h with 1 mM RA, and then\n10 mg/ml ActD was added. Cells were collected, and\ntotal RNA was isolated at the indicated time points.\n\n2.7. Cycloheximide treatment\n\nTo inhibit protein synthesis, cells were incubated with\n10 mg/ml cycloheximide, with or without retinoic acid\ntreatment (1 mM) for 48 h. To determine the turn over of\nCu,Zn- and Mn-SOD protein, cells were collected from\nthe three different types of human fibroblasts primary\ncultures at the indicated time for western blot analysis.\n\n2.8. RNA isolation and real time RT-PCR\n\nTotal RNA was extracted with RNA-Plus (Qbiogene,\nIllkirch, France) from normal (N, Normal Skin),\nlesional (LP, Lesional Psoriatic Skin) and non-lesional\n(nLP, non-Lesional Psoriatic Skin) cultured fibroblasts,\nand 1 mg of each sample was reverse-transcribed into\ncDNA using a first-strand cDNA-synthesis kit (Amer-\nsham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).\n\nReal-time quantitative PCR was conducted with the\nTaqMan system (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) for\nthe Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD steady state mRNA\nlevels with or without RA treatment or the LightCycler\nsystem for the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNA\nstability (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)\nusing the DNA-binding dye SYBR Green for the\ndetection of PCR products according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed in\na total volume of 20 ml in the presence of 2 ml of cDNA,\n2 ml of 10! LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I,\n1.25 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of both primers. After de-\nnaturation at 95 \ufffdC for 10 min, the samples underwent\n40 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95 \ufffdC; 5 s at 60 \ufffdC and\n8 s at 72 \ufffdC). Sense and antisense primers were re-\nspectively: 5#-GGC GAC CTG GAA GTC CAA CT-3#\nand 5#-CCA TCA GCA CCA CAG CCT TC-3# for PO;\n5#-CTG AAG GCC TGC ATG GAT TC-3# and 5#-\nCCA AGT CTC CAA CAT GCC TCT C-3# for Cu,Zn-\nSOD; 5#-CGT GAC TTT GGT TCC TTT GAC A-3#\nand 5#-AAG TGT CCC CGT TCC TTA TTG A-3# for\nMn-SOD. Experiments were performed with duplicates\n\n\n\n72 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nfor each point, and all results were normalized to P0\n(RPLP0, human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein)\ncDNA detected in the same sample.\n\n2.9. Analysis of statistical significance\n\nData were analysed by the ANOVA test.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Retinoic acid treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts\ndecreased SOD enzymatic activities\n\nIn agreement with our previous findings [15], both\nnon-lesional (nLP) and lesional (LP) psoriatic fibroblasts\nexhibit significantly higher levels of Mn-SOD and\nCu,Zn-SOD activities compared to normal (N) fibro-\nblasts (Table 1). Treatment with 1 mM RA for 4 days\ndecreased the Cu,Zn-SOD activity determined in all\nthree cell types by 18% ( p! 0.005), 26% ( p! 0.005),\nand 23% ( p! 0.025) for normal, nLP, and LP\nfibroblasts, respectively. Interestingly, the Mn-SOD\nactivity was dramatically decreased by 1 mM RA\ntreatment for 4 days in psoriatic fibroblasts and returned\nto levels equivalent to that in normal firbroblasts (83%\nand 78% decrease in nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts,\nrespectively, p! 0.005), whereas RA had no effect on\nMn-SOD activity in normal fibroblasts (Table 1).\n\n3.2. Time dependency of decreased SOD enzymatic\nactivities upon retinoic acid treatment\n\nThe effects of treating cells with RA for increasing\nperiods of time on Cu,Zn-SOD (panel A) and Mn-SOD\n(panel B) activities are depicted in Fig. 1. RA treatment\nof nLP, LP and normal fibroblasts showed only a slight\neffect on Cu,Zn-SOD activity through 3 h. However,\na decrease in Cu,Zn-SOD activity was observed in all\nthree cell types at 96 h of treatment with RA, which was\nmaximal at 18 h (Fig. 1A). Importantly, RA had little\neffect on the low basal level Mn-SOD activity present in\nnormal fibroblasts through 96 h of treatment, while\ntreatment of both nLP and LP psoriatic fibroblasts with\nRA for 3 h resulted in a dramatic decrease in Mn-SOD\nactivity (Fig. 1B). This decrease in Mn-SOD activity in\nresponse to RA treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts was\nmaintained through 96 h. At this time, the Mn-SOD\nactivity of psoriatic cells was similar to its basal level\ndetermined in normal fibroblasts.\n\n3.3. Retinoic acid effects on Cu,Zn-SOD\nand Mn-SOD protein levels\n\nThe protein levels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD\npresent in control and RA-treated cells were analysed by\nwestern blot and densitometric scanning of the auto-\nradiographs (Fig. 2). Exposure to RA was found to\nreduce the level of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in both normal\nand psoriatic fibroblasts from 18 h through 96 h of\ntreatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no alteration in the\nlevel of Mn-SOD protein was observed in any of the cell\ntypes through 96 h of treatment with RA (Fig. 2B).\n\nIn another set of experiments, cells were treated for\n18 h and 96 h. While the Mn-SOD protein level was not\nchanged by RA treatment of either normal or psoriatic\nfibroblasts (Fig. 2D), RA treatment did result in\ndecreased levels of Cu,Zn-SOD protein in all three\ndifferent human primary cell types (nZ 4 of each\nprimary cultures, Fig. 2C). Thus, in comparison with\nuntreated cells, the mean valuesG SEM of Cu,Zn-SOD\nprotein levels were decreased by 17%G 4 ( p! 0.02),\n19%G 2 ( p! 0.05) and 27%G 8 ( p! 0.03) in nor-\nmal, nLP and LP RA-treated cells, respectively.\n\n3.4. Analysis of Mn-SOD steady-state mRNA levels\n\nNext, the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD mRNA levels in\nall three primary cell types were determined using real\ntime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction\nTable 1\n\nDown-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD activities by retinoic acid in cultured fibroblasts isolated from skin of normal subjects and from\n\nlesional and non-lesional psoriatic patients\n\nSOD activities\n\nFibroblasts Treatment Mn-SOD (mU/mg prot) Cu,Zn-SOD (mU/mg prot)\n\nNormal 0 72.3G 5.3 (59e102) 231.9G 16.0 (180e306)\n\n(nZ 7) RA 96 h 74.7G 6.1 (57e104) 191.9G 8.4 (159e222)\nNon-Lesional Psoriatic 0 233.7G 22.3 (143e300) 364.4G 22.0 (293e443.5)\n\n(nZ 7) RA 96 h 38.8G 4.8 (29e61) 270.0G 26.6 (192e338.5)\nLesional Psoriatic 0 267.0G 19.7 (220e320) 363.6G 26.4 (275e452)\n\n(nZ 7) RA 96 h 57.6G 9.7 (40e82) 279.7G 6.9 (260e300)\n\nData are expressed as the meanG SEM of triplicate determinations carried out with 7 primary cultures of Normal, non-Lesional Psoriatic, and\nLesional Psoriatic human fibroblasts with and without treatment by 1 mM RA for 4 days.

Discussion\n\nThe involvement of oxygen free radicals in a growing\nlist of diseases indicates a need for pharmaceutical agents\nthat may inhibit the production of free radicals. These\nmolecules may enhance radical scavenging systems,\nwhich may then reverse oxidative damage to important\ncellular components including those of the signal trans-\nduction pathways. All-trans retinoic acid (RA), the\nactive metabolite of vitamin A, is critical in the\nregulation of a number of biological processes, including\nembryogenesis and cell growth [22,23] and it also has\nbeen used in the treatment of psoriasis [24]. Previous\nresults, which demonstrated that RA treatment of cells\ncould reverse the oxidatively modified state of protein\nkinase C [25], and of PKA [14], indicated that RA might\nact to alter redox activities within the cell. However, its\nmechanism of action is still unclear. To assess the role of\nRA as an important regulator for treatment of psoriasis,\nwe have investigated the effects of RA on Cu,Zn-SOD\nand Mn-SOD activity as well as mRNA and protein\nlevels in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts.\n\nRetinoic acid treatment of psoriatic (nLP and\nLP) fibroblasts produced a significant, time-dependent\ndecrease in Mn-SOD activity and mRNA to the basal\nlevels observed in normal fibroblasts. As increased Mn-\nSOD activity occurs in response to an oxidative stress\nand particularly in response to superoxide anions, the\nantioxidant effects of RA treatment results in a reduction\nof Mn-SOD activity in the psoriatic cells to basal levels.\nInterestingly, the amount of Mn-SOD protein found in\nthese cells was not modified by RA treatment. However,\ndiscrepancies between mRNA and protein levels have\nalso been reported by others. Ahlemeyer et al. [26]\nshowed that staurosporine did not influence the mRNA\nlevels of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD, but decreased the\nprotein levels and the activity of both enzymes in\ncultures from neonatal rat hippocampus. Tsan et al. [27]\n\n\n\n76 P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nshowed that hyperoxia-induced increase in the mRNA\nlevel of Mn-SOD in the lung was not associated with an\nincrease in the protein level or enzymatic activity of Mn-\nSOD. Niu et al. [28] found an induction of the Mn-SOD\nmRNA by lipopolysaccharides in rat astrocytes, with\na constant Mn-SOD protein level. These observations\nsuggest that SOD protein levels could be dissociated\nfrom their synthesis and from their enzyme activities.\nThe fact that RA decreases mRNA levels of Mn-SOD in\npsoriatic fibroblasts without a significant decrease in\nprotein levels could be explained by the stability of these\nenzymes in time course of our experiments. Our results\nare in agreement with a 5e6 h half-life for Mn-SOD\n[29]. It is also possible that the RA treatment has altered\nthe subcellular distribution of the protein. For example,\nif the RA treatment enhanced protein transport into the\nlysozome or proteosome through post-translational\nmodifications such as ubiqutination, it is possible that\nwhile total cellular protein levels were not changed, the\nenzymatic activity was reduced due to the change in\nsubcellular localization. This hypothesis awaits further\ninvestigation.\n\nEnzyme activities often are modulated by post-\ntranslational modification of the protein. Covalent\nmodifications such as disulfide formation, phosphoryla-\ntion, acetylation, glycosylation and nitration all have\nbeen reported [30]. An additional modification termed\nretinoylation also has been observed in cells treated with\nretinoic acid [31,32]. Following activation of retinoic\nacid in a coenzyme A-mediated reaction, a thioester\nbond between protein and RA can be created. The RI\nand RII regulatory subunits of PKA were found to be\nretinoylated in HL 60 cells [32], and we also observed\nretinoylation of RI and RII in normal and psoriatic\nfibroblasts [33]. Retinoylation of the RII regulatory\nsubunit, as well as total protein retinoylation, was\nobserved to be increased in psoriatic cells. This raises the\npossibility that Mn-SOD could be covalently modified\nby retinoylation in response to RA treatment of\npsoriatic cells, thus explaining our observed decrease\nin enzyme activity. Finally we recently have shown an\nincrease of carbonylation in psoriatic cells, which could\nalso be responsible for protein modification and de-\ncreased enzyme activity [34].\n\nRetinoic acid treatment had a differential effect on\nthe modulation of Cu,Zn-SOD. The basal level of\nCu,Zn-SOD mRNA was not significantly altered in\npsoriatic as compared to normal fibroblasts, whereas\nthe basal Mn-SOD mRNA level was significantly\nelevated in psoriatic fibroblasts. In studies with\npsoriatic epidermis, Lo\u0308ntz et al. [35] reported that the\nexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was unchanged in\npsoriatic (nLP and LP) compared to normal skin. In\nour case, we have determined that retinoic acid\ntreatment resulted in decreased levels of Cu,Zn-SOD\nmRNA in psoriatic cells. However, the mechanism(s)\nunderlying the down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD expres-\nsion remains unclear. In fact, there is little information\nconcerning factors which may regulate Cu,Zn-SOD\ntranscription, as Cu,Zn-SOD is constitutively expressed\nin primary cultures of dermal fibroblasts, and is not\nregulated by cytokines and growth factors [36]. Re-\ncently, Frank et al. [37] showed a direct coupling of\nCu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression levels to the presence\nof nitric oxide, since Cu,Zn-SOD levels declined during\nacute inflammation (endotoxemic shock) in the pres-\nence of a selective inhibitor of iNOS and without\ninvolvement of the soluble guanylate cyclase. This\nsuggested the possibility that under conditions of\nchronic inflammation, such as in psoriatic fibroblasts,\nCu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression might be regulated by\nH2O2, NO and peroxinitrite.\n\nResults presented here showed that RA treatment of\npsoriatic fibroblasts for 18 h down-regulated Cu,Zn-\nSOD mRNA steady-state levels. These results suggest\neither transcriptional regulation or a modification of\nmRNA stability of Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA expression with\nRA treatment of psoriatic cells, but a translational\nregulation of Cu,Zn-SOD levels in normal cells.\nRetinoids appear to exert their biological effects through\nmultiple gene regulatory nuclear factors [38e40]. An\nactivated retinoidereceptor complex can regulate gene\nexpression by two distinct mechanisms. It can activate\ntranscription by binding to a retinoid response element\nin the promoter of specific genes. However, no retinoid\nresponse element was found within the promoter regions\nof the Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD genes. Alternatively,\nRA can indirectly repress the activity of other nuclear\ntranscription factors such as AP-1 [41,42]. The activated\nretinoid receptor complex can interact with cofactor\nproteins that are required for AP-1 mediated gene\ntranscription factor. However, no binding sequence for\nthe AP-1 transcription factor has been found within the\nproximal promoter of Cu,Zn-SOD. Thus, RA regula-\ntion of Cu,Zn-SOD gene expression may require\ninteraction with other cellular components, such as\nother cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs,\nsee for review Noy [43]). The possible involvement of\nCRABPs in mediating this down-regulatory effect of RA\non Cu,Zn-SOD expression is of interest in view of the\nfinding that CRABP II levels are elevated in psoriatic\nskin [44] and awaits further analysis. While in this report\nwe studied the effect of RA on psoriatic fibroblasts, as\nan immunologic sentinel. RA has other cellular targets\nin psoriasis such as keratinocytes and T lymphocytes.\nThus it is quite possible that Cu,Zn-SOD could also be\ninvolved in the prevention of T-cell apoptosis [46]. This\nhypothesis awaits further testing.\n\nIn conclusion, RA treatment of primary psoriatic\nfibroblasts resulted in a significant decrease in the\nelevated level of Mn-SOD activity found in these cells\nat a level similar to that in normal fibroblasts. This\n\n\n\n77P. Gerbaud et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 24 (2005) 69e78\nregulatory effect of RA could be at the level of protein\ncovalent modification or subcellular localization or at\nthe Mn-SOD mRNA steady-state level, since there was\nno significant change in total cellular Mn-SOD protein\nlevels. Retinoic acid treatment of both normal and\npsoriatic fibroblasts also caused a decrease in Cu,Zn-\nSOD activity that appeared to be at the level of\ntranscriptional regulation. Thus our data begins to\nprovide a biochemical basis for the use of RA in the\ntreatment of psoriasis.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Dr Isabelle Gorin from the\nDepartment of Dermatology, Ho\u0302pital Tarnier (Paris)\nfor her kind clinical assistance.

(Rubiaceae),\nexhibits antitumor effects, its biological activity in oral cancer has not been reported. We thus investigated the effects and putative\nmechanism of apoptosis induced by mollugin in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (OSCCs). Results show that mollugin\ninduces cell death in a dose-dependent manner in primary andmetastatic OSCCs.Mollugin-induced cell death involved apoptosis,\ncharacterized by the appearance of nuclear shrinkage, flow cytometric analysis of sub-G\n\n1\nphase arrest, and annexin V-FITC and\n\npropidium iodide staining. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR revealed that mollugin suppressed activation of NF-\ud835\udf05B and NF-\ud835\udf05B-\ndependent gene products involved in antiapoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl), invasion (MMP-9 and ICAM-1), and angiogenesis (FGF-2\nand VEGF). Furthermore, mollugin induced the activation of p38, ERK, and JNK and the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-\n1) and nuclear factor E2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2). Mollugin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of HO-1 were reversed by an\nHO-1 inhibitor and Nrf2 siRNA. Collectively, this is the first report to demonstrate the effectiveness of mollugin as a candidate for\na chemotherapeutic agent in OSCCs via the upregulation of the HO-1 and Nrf2 pathways and the downregulation of NF-\ud835\udf05B.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) represents the fifth\nmost common cancer worldwide and is a significant cause\nof cancer morbidity and mortality. Each year, approximately\n300,000 new cases are diagnosed with only a 50% survival\nrate over 5 years. Common treatments, including surgery,\nradiation therapy, and chemotherapy, have very low success\nrates [1]. Two of the most frequently used chemotherapeutic\ndrugs, 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, cause side effects such\nas bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, and\nrenal damage, which remain problems that need to be\n\nresolved [2]. To overcome such side effects and limitations,\nthe direction of present research into novel antitumor agents\nhas turned to natural products, especially plants used in\ntraditional medicine [3]. Previously, we demonstrated that\nhighly purified sulfur [4] and herbal medicines, such as\nCaesalpinia sappan [5], Coptidis rhizoma [6], and verticinone\n[7], exerted antitumor effects on oral cancer cells in vitro.\nMoreover, we showed that a single compound isolated from\nCaesalpinia sappan heartwood, isoliquiritigenin 2\udba0\udc20-methyl\nether (ILME), had antioral cancer effects involving mitogen-\nactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the nuclear factor-\n\ud835\udf05B (NF-\ud835\udf05B) pathway [8]. In addition, we reported that\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\na flavonoid extracted from Caesalpinia sappan, sappanchal-\ncone, suppressed oral cancer cell growth and induced apop-\ntosis through activation of p53-dependent mitochondrial\nMAPK and NF-\ud835\udf05B signaling [9].\n\nThe roots of Rubia cordifolia L. have been widely used\nas a traditional herbal medicine in Korea to treat cough,\nbladder and kidney stones, joint inflammation, uterine hem-\norrhage, and uteritis [10]. In addition, this plant has been\nused in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment\nof arthritis, dysmenorrheal, hematorrhea, hemostasis, and\npsoriasis [11, 12]. Among the bioactive components from\nRubia cordifolia, mollugin (C\n\n17\nH\n16\nO\n4\n; methyl 2,2-dimethyl-\n\n6-hydroxy-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5-carboxylate) has been\nreported to have antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities,\nand neuroprotective and apoptotic effects [13\u201316]. A recent\nstudy demonstrated thatmollugin induced apoptosis through\nendoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated activation of c-Jun\nN-terminal kinase (JNK) and the mitochondria-dependent\ncaspase cascade, regulated by Bcl-xL in human Jurkat T cells\n[14]. Moreover, mollugin inhibited proliferation and induced\napoptosis by suppressing fatty acid synthase in HER2-\noverexpressing human breast and ovarian cancer cells [17].\n\nHeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible cytoprotective\nenzyme that catalyzes the initial rate-limiting reaction in\nheme catabolism. Previously, we reported that the HO-1\npathway plays a key role in the adaptation of cells to stressful\nconditions and the recovery of dental pulp cells and perio-\ndontal ligament cells from injury [18\u201320]. Despite its cyto-\nprotective properties, recent evidence suggests a role for HO-\n1 in promoting cancer [21]. HO-1 is overexpressed in various\ntypes of cancer and is further induced by radiation and\nchemotherapy [22, 23]. Regarding the mechanisms of HO-\n1 induction, several studies have suggested the involvement\nof MAPK and NF-\ud835\udf05B pathways, as well as nuclear factor\nerythroid 2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2) [18, 24]. However, the\nprecise cellular mechanisms of mollugin on OSCCs are not\ncompletely understood.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the chemothera-\npeutic effect of mollugin on human primary and metastatic\nOSCCs in vitro. In addition, we further explored whether\nthe effect of mollugin is related to Nrf2 activation and HO-\n1 expression.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Reagents. Mollugin was isolated from root of heartwood\nof Rubia cordifolia L. as described previously [13]. Antibody\nagainst NF-\ud835\udf05B p65, I\ud835\udf05B, Nrf2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, p53, p21, or\nphosphorylated isoforms of I\ud835\udf05B and horseradish peroxidase-\nconjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa\nCruz Biotechnology (Delaware Avenue, CA). ERK, JNK, p38\nor phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 were purchased\nfrom Cell signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and\nother tissue culture reagents were purchased fromGibco BRL\n(Grand Island, NY). All other chemicals were obtained from\nSigma (St. Louis, MO), unless indicated otherwise.\n\n2.2. Cell Culture. The cell line HNSCC4 (HN4), from a\nprimary OSCCs, and cell line HNSCC12 (HN12), from a\nmetastatic carcinoma of the OSCCs [25], were derived in the\nlaboratory of Dr. John F. Ensley (Wayne State University).\nCells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,\n100U/mL penicillin, and 100 \ud835\udf07g/mL streptomycin in a\nhumidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n\n2\nat 37\u2218C. Cells were\n\ndissociated with 0.25% trypsin just before transferring for\nexperiments and counted using a hemocytometer.\n\nHuman keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (nontransformed\nhuman cell line) were incubated in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 50\ud835\udf07g/mL strepto-\nmycin, and 50 \ud835\udf07g/mL penicillin at 37\u2218C in 5% CO\n\n2\n. Human\n\ngingival fibroblasts (HGFs) cell line by transfection with the\nE6/E7 open reading frames of HPV type 16 was cultured\naccording to the following protocol, as reported by our study\n[26]. Briefly, HGFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100 \ud835\udf07g/mL strepto-\nmycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n\n2\nat 37\u2218C.\n\n2.3. Antiproliferative Assay. Cell viability was determined by\n3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-\nmide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in flat-bottomed\n96-well plates, at 1 \u00d7 105 cell/well 24 h prior to treatment. The\ncells were treated for various lengths of time with the agents\nindicated. Then 25\ud835\udf07L of 5mg/mL MTT was added to each\nwell. After 4 h incubation at 37\u2218C, 100 \ud835\udf07L of lysing buffer was\nadded. The buffer consisted of 20% w/v of sodium dodecyl\nsulfate in 0.1% of HCl solution. The plates were incubated for\na further analysis on an ELISA reader at 570 nm. The same\nexperiment was repeated in three separate cultures, and the\ndata were presented as the means \u00b1 SD of five observations.\n\n2.4. Flow Cytometry\n\n2.4.1. Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining. Cells were seeded at\n5 \u00d7 105cells/well in six-well plates. After 24 h, cells were\ntreated with mollugin the 3 days. After treatment, cells were\nharvested and pelleted by centrifugation (400\u00d7g, 4\u2218C, 5min).\nThe cells were fixed with cold 75% ethanol for 24 h and\nthen stained with PI solution, consisting of 45mg/mL PI,\n10mg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation\nin the dark at 4\u2218C for 1 h, fluorescence-activated cells were\nsorted using the FACScan flow cytometer, and the data were\nanalyzed using Cellfit Analysis Software.\n\n2.5. Fluorescein-Isothiocyanate-(FITC-) Annexin V and Pro-\npidium Iodide (PI) Double Staining. Cells (5 \u00d7 105) were\nseeded in 6-well plates, incubated for 24 h, and then treated\nwith or without mollugin, and the incubation was continued\nfor 3 days. After treatment, the cell pellet was prepared in\na FACStar tube containing annexin V-FITC solution and\nincubated in 5%CO\n\n2\nat 37\u2218C.ThePI solution (withoutNP40)\n\nwas then added, and the ratio of PI-positive and annexin\nV-positive cells was measured using the flow cytometer.\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\n2.6. Morphological Analysis of Apoptosis by Staining with 4\udba0\udc20,6-\nDiamino-2-Phenylindole Dihydrochloride (DAPI). To con-\nfirm that the nuclei underwent morphological changes, the\ncells were cultured in 60mm dishes overnight and then\nwashed twice in DMEM. The cells were then treated with\nmollugin and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, after which they\nwere incubated in 1\ud835\udf07g/mL DAPI solution for 30min in the\ndark. The cells were then examined using a fluorescence\nmicroscope (Zeiss, Oberko\u0308chen, Germany).\n\n2.7. Western Blot Analysis. Western blot analysis was per-\nformed by lysing cells in 20mMTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) con-\ntaining protease inhibitor mixture (0.1mM phenylmethane-\nsulfonyl fluoride, 5mg/mL aprotinin, 5mg/mL pepstatin A,\nand 1mg/mL chymostatin). Protein concentration was deter-\nmined using the Lowry protein assay kit (P5626; Sigma).\nAn equal amount of protein for each sample was resolved\nusing 7% or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then electrophoretically\ntransferred onto a Hybond-enhanced chemiluminescence\n(ECL) nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\nThe membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and sequen-\ntially incubated with primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary\nantibody followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia\nBiotech, Piscataway, NJ).\n\n2.8. Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated\nusing the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. It was then\nreverse-transcribed using AccuPower RT premix (Bioneer,\nDaejeon, Korea). The PCR amplification of the resulting\ncDNAsampleswas performedusing aGeneAmpPCRSystem\n2400 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer,Wellesley, MA, USA).The\nprimers information is summarized in Table 1. The following\nPCR conditions were used: 34 cycles of denaturation at 95\u2218C\nfor 30 s, primer annealing at 60\u2218C for 30 s, and extension\nat 72\u2218C for 30 s. The PCR products were resolved on 1-2%\nagarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.\n\n2.9. HO-1 and Nrf2 siRNA Transfection. The target sequence\nfor human HO-1 siRNA was 5\udba0\udc20-AACUUUCAGAAGGGC-\nCAGGUGTT-3\udba0\udc20 (forward) and 5\udba0\udc20-CACCUGGCCCUU-\nCUGAAAGUUTT-3\udba0\udc20 (reverse). Transfection of Nrf2 siRNA\nwas performed using the target sequence 5\udba0\udc20-AAGAGUAUG-\nAGCUGGAAAAACTT-3\udba0\udc20 (forward) and 5\udba0\udc20-GUUUUU-\nCCAGCUCAUACUCUUTT-3\udba0\udc20 (reverse). Cells were trans-\nfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invit-\nrogen) according to the manufacture\u2019s instruction. Silencer\nNegative Control siRNA (Invitrogen) was introduced into\ncells by the same method. Following transfection, cells were\ncultured in six-well plates at 37\u2218C until required.\n\n2.10. Statistical Analysis. Data are expressed as the mean\n\u00b1 standard deviation. Statistical comparisons of the results\nwere made using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant\ndifferences (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05) between the means of control and\nsulfur-treated cells were analyzed using Dunnett\u2019s test.\n\nTable 1: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction primers.\n\nGene Sequence 5\udba0\udc20-3\udba0\udc20 Size\n\nMMP-9 Forward: GTTGGGGAGGGCTGTCCGTGA 911 bp\nReverse: CGTGGCGCTATCCAGCTCACC\n\nICAM-1 Forward: CGCCCGATTGCTTTAGCTTG 320 bp\nReverse: CGACTCACCTGGGAACAGAG\n\nVEGF Forward: TCAAGGTTGGCGGAAGTGAGG 443 bp\nReverse: CCCTTGCATCAGTAGGCTTCA\n\nFGF2 Forward: GCCTCATTTCCATTTCGTGG 224 bp\nReverse: CGGGGGTACTGGTTTACAG\n\n\ud835\udefd-actin Forward: CATGGATGATGATATCGCCGC 319 bp\nReverse: ACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCT\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effect of Mollugin on HN4 and HN12 Cell Viability.\nTo investigate the effect of mollugin on the proliferation\nof human OSCCs, the MTT assay was used. As shown in\nFigure 1, mollugin inhibited cellular proliferation in a dose-\nand time-dependent manner. Moreover, mollugin displayed\nhigher cytotoxicity in primary OSCC HN4 cells compared\nwith metastatic OSCC HN12 cells, although the overall trend\nof the effects of mollugin onHN4 andHN12 cells was similar.\nFurthermore, we tested whether mollugin has any toxic\neffect on nonneoplastic human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT)\nand gingival fibroblasts (GF). Interestingly, we did not find\nsignificant cytotoxicity or cell death by mollugin on HaCaT\nand GF (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).\n\n3.2. Effect of Mollugin on HN4 and HN12 Cell Apoptosis. To\ndetermine whether the cause of cell death was apoptosis,\nHN4 and HN12 cells were exposed to 40\ud835\udf07M mollugin\nfor 3 days. This concentration was used because it repro-\nducibly induced 50% growth inhibition in HN4 and HN12\ncells cultured for 3 days. Cell nuclei were stained with\n4\udba0\udc20,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a fluorescent DNA-\nbinding dye (Figure 2(a)). DAPI staining showed that the\ncontrol nuclei were large and round without condensation\nor fragmentation, whereas most of the nuclei of mollugin-\ntreated cells were condensed and fragmented, as is typical\nduring apoptosis. The onset of apoptotic cell death by mollu-\ngin was confirmed by flow cytometry of HN4 and HN12 cells\n(Figure 2(b)).Without treatment, only 3.88%HN4 and 2.80%\nHN12 cells were in the sub-G\n\n1\nregion; however, mollugin\n\ntreatment increased the proportions of cells in the sub-G\n1\n\nregion to 20.26% and 31.46%, respectively. To determine\nwhether the growth inhibitory effect ofmollugin is associated\nwith cell death, annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) double\nstaining of HN4 and HN12 cells and flow cytometry was\nperformed (Figure 2(c)). Treatment of cells withmollugin for\n3 days increased the number of annexin V+/PI+ stained cells.\nThese results demonstrate that the inhibition of cell growth\nby mollugin was caused by the induction of apoptosis.\n\n3.3.

Mol-\nlugin treatment upregulated p53 and p21 expression in both\nHN4 and HN12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In con-\ntrast, the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 andBcl-xl proteins\nwas dose-dependently reduced by mollugin treatment in\n\nHN4 andHN12 cells. Next, we investigated whethermollugin\ncould modulate levels of NF-\ud835\udf05B-regulated gene products\ninvolved in invasion (ICAM-1 andMMP-9) and angiogenesis\n(VEGF and FGF-2) ofOSCCs.The results show thatmollugin\ndownregulated the expression ofNF-\ud835\udf05B-regulated gene prod-\nucts, includingMMP-9, ICAM-1, VEGF, and FGF-2mRNA in\na dose-dependent manner (Figure 3(c)).\n\n3.4.

In contrast, mollugin did not affect total p38, ERK,\nor JNK levels (Figure 4(a)).\n\nSince the stress response element/Nrf2 transcription fac-\ntor pathway is important for HO-1 expression [23], we next\ndetermined whether Nrf2 signaling is involved in mollugin-\ninducedHO-1 expression and apoptosis. Initially, Nrf2 activa-\ntion was assessed by the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus.\nTreatment with mollugin resulted in an accumulation of\nNrf2 in the nucleus in primary and metastatic OSCCs\n(Figure 4(b)).\n\nTo determine whether mollugin induces expression of\nantioxidant genes, HO-1 expression in oral cancer cells and\nthe change in the pattern of HO-1 expression were evaluated.\nHO-1 protein expression in primary and metastatic OSCCs\nincreased following mollugin treatment in a time-dependent\nmanner (Figure 4(c)).\n\nTo confirm the involvement of MAPK pathways in the\nmollugin-driven activation of NF-\ud835\udf05B and Nrf2, inhibitors\nof ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP6100126), and p38 (SB203580)\nMAPK signaling were used. Mollugin-induced NF-\ud835\udf05B, Nrf2,\nand HO-1 expression was effectively inhibited by PD98059,\nSP600126, and SB203580 (Figure 4(d)), suggesting that p38,\nERK1/2, and JNK play important roles in activating NF-\ud835\udf05B,\nNrf2, and HO-1 in HN4 and HN12 cells.\n\n3.5. Involvement of the HO-1 Pathway in Mollugin-Induced\nApoptosis. To examine the cytotoxic potential of tin proto-\nporphyrin (SnPP), an HO-1 inhibitor, its effect on viability\nwas initially measured by the MTT assay (Figure 5(a)).\nAlthough, 10 or 20\ud835\udf07MSnPP had no cytotoxicity effect for 3 h,\nwe found that SnPP exhibited slight cytotoxicity on HN4 and\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\n6 BioMed Research International\n\nHN4 HN12\n\nNF-\ufffd\ud705B p65 nuclear\n\nLamin B\n\np-I\ufffd\ud705B\n\nI\ufffd\ud705B\n\n(min)\n0 10 30 60 90 0 10 30 60 90\n\n(min)\n\n(a)\n\nHN4 HN12 \n\n\ufffd\ud6fd-actin\n\nBcl-2\n\nBcl-xL\n\np53\n\np21WAF1/CIP1\n\n0 10 20 40 800 10 20 40 80\nMollugin (\ufffd\ud707M) Mollugin (\ufffd\ud707M)\n\n(b)\n\nMMP-9\n\nICAM-1\n\nVEGF\n\nFGF2\n\n\ufffd\ud6fd-actin\n0 10 20 40 800 10 20 40 80\n\nHN4 HN12\n\nMollugin (\ufffd\ud707M) Mollugin (\ufffd\ud707M)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3: Effects of mollugin on activation of NF-\ud835\udf05B (a), and expression of NF-\ud835\udf05B-regulated gene products involved in apoptosis and\nantiapoptosis (b), metastasis, and angiogenesis (c) in OSCCs. Cells were treated with 40 \ud835\udf07Mmollugin for indicated times (a) or 3 days (b, c).\nThe figure is representative of 3 independent experiments.\n\nHN12 cells at 16 h. Based on these findings, we chose to use\nSnPP for 3 h.\n\nTo determine whether the induction of HO-1 plays a\nrole in mollugin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in\nOSCCs, cells were treated with SnPP, an HO-1 inhibitor, for\n3 h before incubation with mollugin for 3 days. MTT assays\nshowed that mollugin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis\nin HN4 and HN12 cells were dose-dependently reversed\nby pretreatment with SnPP (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). In\naddition, SnPP treatment abolished the induction of p53\nand p21WAF1/CIP1 expression by mollugin, but reversed the\nexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl (Figure 5(c)).\n\nAdditionally, we used a siRNA-expressing plasmid to\ninduce HO-1 gene silencing. HN4 and HN12 cells were\ntransfected with an HO-1-targeting siRNA expression vector\n(Figure 6). The siRNA approach resulted in high silencing\nefficacies for HO-1, which was confirmed by Western\nblot analysis (Figure 6(c)). Silencing of HO-1 significantly\nattenuated mollugin-induced cytotoxicity (Figure 6(a))\n\nand apoptosis (Figure 6(b)). Moreover HO-1 RNA blocked\nmollugin-induced Nrf2, p53, and p21 upregulation as well as\nBcl-2 and Bcl-xl downregulation (Figure 6(c)).\n\n3.6. Involvement of the Nrf2 Pathway in Mollugin-Induced\nHO-1 Induction and Apoptosis. To investigate whether\nmollugin-induced apoptosis and HO-1 expression were\nmediated by Nrf2 activation, a specific small interfering RNA\n(siRNA) against Nrf2 was used. As shown in Figure 7(c),\ntransfection with Nrf2 siRNA for 5 h in HN4 and HN12\ncells blocked mollugin-induced HO-1 and Nrf2 expression.\nHowever, Nrf2 siRNA did not affect the mollugin-induced\np65 expression. Transfection with Nrf2 siRNA inhibited\nmollugin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HN4 and\nHN12 cells (Figures 7(a) and 7(b)). Moreover, transfection\nwith Nrf2 siRNA in HN4 and HN12 cells reduced mollugin-\ninduced apoptosis proteins (p53 and p21), but reversed\nantiapoptosis proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) (Figure 7(c)).\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nBioMed Research International 7\n\nHN4 HN12\np-ERK\n\nERK\n\np-JNK\n\nJNK\n\np-p38\n\np38\n\n0 10 30 60 90 0 10 30 60 90\n(min)(min)\n\n(a)\n\nHN4 HN12\n\n(min)\n0 10 30 60 90 0 10 30 60 90\n\nNrf2 nuclear\n\nNrf2 cytoplasm\n\n\ufffd\ud6fd-actin\n\n\ufffd\ud6fd-actin\nMollugin\n\n(min)\n\n(b)\n\nHO-1\n\n\ufffd\ud6fd-actin\n\nMollugin 0 0.5 1 2 3 0 0.5 1 2 3\n(days)\n\nHN4 HN12\n\n(days)\n\n(c)\n\nHN4 HN12\np-ERK\n\nERK\n\np-JNK\n\nJNK\n\np-p38\n\np38\n\nNF-\ufffd\ud705B p65 nuclear\n\nNrf2 nuclear\n\nNrf2 cytoplasm\n\nMollugin\nPD98059\nSP600125\nSB203580\n\nHO-1\n+\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+ +\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+ +\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 4: Effect of mollugin on phosphorylation of MAPK (a), activation of Nrf2 (b), and expression of HO-1 (c) in OSCCs.

Discussion\n\nThis study is to our knowledge the first to demonstrate that\nmollugin directly induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in\nprimary and metastatic OSCCs and to address the molecular\nbasis of this effect.\n\nWith regard to antitumor activity, mollugin has been\nshown to exert cytotoxic effects on human colon cancer\n(Col2) cells (IC\n\n50\n= 12.3 \ud835\udf07M; [11]), human liver carcinoma\n\n(HepG2) cells (IC\n50\nvalue = 60.2 \ud835\udf07M; [10]), and basal HER2-\n\nexpressing human breast cancer cells (IC\n50\n\nvalue = 58\ud835\udf07M;\n[17]). In the present study, we found that mollugin (10\u2013\n80 \ud835\udf07M) resulted in significant growth inhibition, with an\naverage IC\n\n50\nvalue of 46.3\ud835\udf07M in metastatic OSCCs (HN12)\n\nand 43.9 \ud835\udf07M in primary OSCCs (HN4) after 3 days. These\nantiproliferative properties of mollugin are consistent with\nprevious reports in human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells\n[14] and HER2-overexpressing breast and ovarian cancer\ncell lines [17]. Moreover, we demonstrated that mollugin\ninduced OSCC cell death by triggering apoptosis due to the\npresence of several apoptotic characteristics, including sub-\nG\n1\nphase accumulation, increase in annexin+/PI+ cells, and\n\nDNA fragmentation.\nNF-\ud835\udf05B signaling is a ubiquitous pathway in cell prolif-\n\neration, survival, and apoptosis. Normally, NF-\ud835\udf05B proteins\nare inhibited by binding to I\ud835\udf05B proteins in the cytoplasm.\nStress factors cause degradation of I\ud835\udf05B proteins through\nthe ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway, and NF-\ud835\udf05B is released\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\n10 BioMed Research International\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nC\n\nel\nl v\n\nia\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\nMollugin\nNrf2 siRNA\n\nControl siRNA\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212 +\n+\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212 +\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n+\n\nHN4\nHN12\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nMollugin\nNrf2 siRNA\n\nControl siRNA\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212 +\n+\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212 +\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\nA\nnn\n\nex\nin\n\n V\n+\n\n/P\nI\u2212\n\n(%\n)\n\nHN4\nHN12\n\n+\n\n(b)\n\nMollugin\n\nBcl-xL\n\nBcl-2\n\n\ufffd\ud6fd-actin\n\np53\n\np21WAF1/CIP1\n\nHO-1\n\nTotal Nrf2\n\nNrf2 nuclear\n\nNrf2 siRNA\nControl siRNA\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212 +\n\n+\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212 +\n\n+\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212 +\n\n+\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212 +\n\n+\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nHN12 HN4\n\nNF-\ufffd\ud705B p65 nuclear\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 7: Effect of Nrf2 siRNA onmollugin-induced growth inhibition (a), apoptosis (b), and apoptosis-related proteins expression (c).

Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.\n\nto bind to the DNA of promoter regions of specific genes\nthat increases their transcription rate [27, 28]. To explore\nthe mechanism underlying mollugin-induced apoptosis in\nOSCCs, we examined NF-\ud835\udf05B activation. In agreement with\nprevious findings that mollugin suppressed NF-\ud835\udf05B activation\ninHER2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells [17], our\nresults indicate that mollugin significantly inhibited NF-\ud835\udf05B\nactivation by reducing the level of phospho-I\ud835\udf05B\ud835\udefc, leading to\nblockage of the I\ud835\udf05B\ud835\udefc pathway in NF-\ud835\udf05B activation in OSCCs.\nIn addition, it was reported that mollugin significantly sup-\npressed TNF-\ud835\udefc-induced NF-\ud835\udf05B transcriptional activation in\nHT-29 human colonic epithelial cells [13].\n\nGenes involved in the proliferation, apoptosis, antiapop-\ntosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer are regulated\nby NF-\ud835\udf05B [29]. Constitutive activation of NF-\ud835\udf05B negatively\n\nregulates the proapoptotic functions of p53 by inducing the\nexpression of an array of antiapoptotic genes, including Bcl-\n2 and Bcl-xL [30]. In our study, treatment with mollugin\ninduced the downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-\nxL levels as well as the upregulation of apoptotic p53 and\np21 levels in OSCCs. Another hallmark of OSCC behavior\nis their propensity for local invasion and metastasis. MMP-\n9 is frequently overexpressed in OSCCs and is dependent\nupon NF-\ud835\udf05B for expression [31]. Adhesion molecules such\nas ICAM-1 are regulated by NF-\ud835\udf05B and are essential for\nthe adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells and thus\nmediate tumor cellmetastasis [32]. Angiogenesis is important\nfor tumor growth and progression. The development of\nangiogenesis is stimulated by cytokines and growth factors,\nand the expression of these cytokines and growth factors is\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nBioMed Research International 11\n\nMollugin\n\n(ERK, p38, JNK)\n\nProapoptotic\n\neffect\n\nAntiapoptotic\n\neffect\n\n?\n\nNF-\ufffd\ud705B \u2193 MAPK \u2191 Nrf2 \u2191\n\nVEGF \u2193 FGF2 \u2193MMP-9 \u2193 ICAM-1\u2193\nHO-1\u2191\n\np21\u2191 p53 \u2191 Bcl-2 \u2193 Bcl-XL \u2193\n\nApoptosis \u2191\n\nFigure 8: Schematic diagram illustrating the Nrf2 pathway and other signaling pathways triggered by exposure to mollugin in in OSCCs.\nMollugin treatment leads to the activation of the cellular stress-dependent signaling pathways mediated byMAPK activation (ERK, JNK, and\np38) and subsequent transcription factor activation (NF-\ud835\udf05B andNrf2). Ultimately, these transcription factors result in altered gene expression\nto produce cytoprotective gene HO-1, allowing lead to apoptosis.\n\ncorrelated with the pathological neovascularization circum-\nstances. Among these angiogenic factors, VEGF and FGF-\n2 are important angiogenic factors and essential for cancers\n[33]. In this study, we found that mollugin inhibited the\nexpression of NF-\ud835\udf05B-regulated gene products involved in\ninvasion (MMP-9 and ICAM-1) and angiogenesis (FGF-2 and\nVEGF). Thus, our results demonstrate that mollugin inhibits\nNF-\ud835\udf05B, leading to suppression of proliferation, invasion, and\nangiogenesis in OSCCs.\n\nThe MAPKs are proline-directed Ser/Thr protein kinases\nthat regulate many cellular processes, including cell prolif-\neration and death. JNK and p38 are activated by cellular\nstress and are associatedwith apoptosis [34].The involvement\nof ERK in the induction of apoptosis by quercetin, resver-\natrol, and taxol has been reported [35, 36]. In the present\nstudy, phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK was detected\nin mollugin-treated OSCCs, which is consistent with our\nprevious reports that sappanchalcone may exert its effect on\nOSCCs through p38, ERK, and JNK activation [9].Therefore,\n\nNF-\ud835\udf05B regulation downstream of the MAPK (ERK1/2, p38,\nand JNK) pathways may be involved in mollugin-induced\napoptosis inOSCCs.However,mollugin activated p38MAPK\nin hippocampal and microglial cells [15] and ERK in HER2-\noverexpressing breast cancer cells [17]. Therefore, MAPK can\nbe differentially activated, and its involvement in apoptosis is\nhighly context and model dependent.\n\nThe role of HO-1 in tumor development is still not\nunderstood completely. Some recent reports demonstrate dis-\ncordant or even completely contrasting results. Nevertheless,\naccumulating evidence indicates that HO-1 is expressed or\noverexpressed in a wide variety of human tumors and plays\na critical role in the progression of neoplastic diseases [37].\nFor example, it has been shown that increased expression\nof HO-1 is associated with a higher rate of proliferation of\nvarious tumor cells [37, 38], although opposite effects have\nbeen observed in breast cancer cells [39]. Furthermore, the\nincreased basal level of HO-1 expression in tumor cells can\nbe further elevated by chemotherapeutics or phytochemicals,\n\n\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE\nD\n\n12 BioMed Research International\n\nsuch as curcumin, carnosol, and ILME [8, 22, 23]. Our results\nshow that mollugin upregulated HO-1 expression in a time-\nand dose-dependent manner (data not shown), consistent\nwith results in hippocampal and microglial cells [15]. We\nfound that growth inhibition and apoptosis ofOSCCs bymol-\nlugin was reversed in the presence of an HO-1 inhibitor. In\naddition, mollugin induced downregulation of antiapoptotic\nBcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels, while upregulation of apoptotic p53\nand p21 levels was reversed by SnPP in a dose-dependent\nmanner. These results suggest that the growth inhibition and\napoptosis-inducing effect of mollugin is mediated via HO-1\nexpression.\n\nRegarding HO-1, Nrf-2 is a relatively well-known tran-\nscription factor [40]. In response to diverse HO-1 inducers,\nNrf2 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus where it\nbinds to the antioxidant response element in the promoter\nregion of the HO-1 gene [41]. In our study, mollugin also\ninduced the translocation of Nrf-2 into the nucleus, as\nevidenced by Western blot. Furthermore, the results of this\nstudy demonstrate a correlation between apoptotic gene\nupregulation and the suppression of antiapoptotic genes of\nOSCCs to undergo mollugin-induced growth inhibition and\napoptosis when Nrf-2 is knocked down. Based on these\nobservations, it is reasonable to conclude that Nrf2 activation\nmediates mollugin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis\nin OSCCs.\n\nRedox-sensitive transcription factor (NF-\ud835\udf05B, AP-1, and\nNrf2) pathways are known to be important molecular targets\nin chemoprevention. Activation of Nrf2 and NF-\ud835\udf05B involves\nregulation of protein kinases, whichmay induce their nuclear\ntranslocation [42]. It was previously shown that mollugin\ninduced apoptosis via JNK inhuman Jurkat T cells [14]. In this\nregard, specific protein kinase inhibitors of PI3 K and ERK\nrepressed Nrf2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of\nNrf2 and NF-\ud835\udf05B in HepG2 cells, as previously reported in\ndifferent cell types [43, 44]. The present results also suggest\nthat the MAPK pathway plays a role in the mollugin-induced\nnuclear translocation of Nrf2 and NF-\ud835\udf05B in HN4 and HN12\ncells. A variety of anticarcinogenic phytochemicals suppress\nNF-\ud835\udf05B signalling and activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway [45],\nsuggesting that the suppression of NF-\ud835\udf05B signalling and the\nactivation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway may crosstalk with each\nother. Indeed, inhibition ofNF-\ud835\udf05B activation by phospholipid\nhydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase and 15-lipoxygenase\nis concomitant to upregulation of HO-1, probably via Nrf2\nactivation [46]. Thus, the findings support that the partici-\npation of NF-\ud835\udf05B p65 in the negative regulation of Nrf2-ARE\nsignalling, providing a new insight into a possible role of\nNF-\ud835\udf05B in suppressing the expression of anti-inflammatory\nor antitumour genes [47]. Our results suggest that MAPK\nsingnaling event mediates the link between NF-\ud835\udf05B and Nrf2.\nAlthough the NF-\ud835\udf05B pathway was inhibited by mollugin\nexposure, Nrf2 siRNA did not seem to participate in the\ntranslocation of NF-\ud835\udf05B, suggesting that NF-\ud835\udf05B and Nrf2\npathways might act in parallel in our in vitro model. A\nsummary of our results is shown in Figure 8.\n\nColectivelly, our results demonstrate for the first time\nthat mollugin inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis\n\nin OSCCs through the NF-\ud835\udf05B/MAPK/Nrf2/HO-1 signal-\ning pathway. Therefore, mollugin may have potential as a\nchemotherapeutic agent for OSCCs. The activities of mol-\nlugin against multiple antitumor targets should be studied\nintensively for further clinical application either as a nat-\nural agent alone or in combination with other commonly\nused chemotherapeutics. Further investigation of mollugin\nin animal models of OSCCS will contribute to additional\nunderstanding of its in vivo activity toward malignant cells\nand its potential toxicity toward normal tissues.\n\nAuthors\u2019 Contribution\n\nY.-M.

Quorum sensing, mediated by small molecules including N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)\nhomoserine lactone (C12), regulates P. aeruginosa growth and virulence. In addition, host cell recognition of C12 initiates\nmultiple signalling responses including cell death. To gain insight into mechanisms of C12-mediated cytotoxicity, we\nstudied the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in host cell responses to C12. Dramatic protection against C12-mediated\ncell death was observed in cells that do not produce the X-box binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s). The leucine\nzipper and transcriptional activation motifs of XBP1s were sufficient to restore C12-induced caspase activation in XBP1s-\ndeficient cells, although this polypeptide was not transcriptionally active. The XBP1s polypeptide also regulated caspase\nactivation in cells stimulated with N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserine lactone (C14), produced by Yersinia enterolitica and\nBurkholderia pseudomallei, and enhanced homoserine lactone-mediated caspase activation in the presence of endogenous\nXBP1s. In C12-tolerant cells, responses to C12 including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a\nwere conserved, suggesting that C12 cytotoxicity is not heavily dependent on these pathways. In summary, this study\nreveals a novel and unconventional role for XBP1s in regulating host cell cytotoxic responses to bacterial acyl homoserine\nlactones.\n\nCitation: Valentine CD, Anderson MO, Papa FR, Haggie PM (2013) X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1s) Is a Critical Determinant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nHomoserine Lactone-Mediated Apoptosis.

P. aeruginosa is the fourth most-commonly isolated\n\nnosocomial pathogen and infections can be fatal, particularly in\n\nimmuno-compromised subjects such as those with burns or\n\nundergoing chemotherapy [1,2,3,4]. Chronic conditions including\n\ncystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\n\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-CF bronchiectasis\n\nare also associated with P. aeruginosa infection [5,6,7]. Antimicro-\n\nbials are currently used against P. aeruginosa; however, infections\n\nare typically refractory to therapeutic interventions [8]. Further-\n\nmore, drug resistant P. aeruginosa strains have been isolated and\n\nbiofilm formation in chronic conditions enhances antimicrobial\n\nresistance and pathogenicity [9,10]. As such, there is urgent need\n\nto understand mechanisms of P. aeruginosa virulence and for new\n\nstrategies to combat infections [10,11].\n\nThe process of quorum sensing (QS) has evolved as a\n\nmechanism by which bacterial communities sense cell density\n\nand consequently regulate processes such as growth, biofilm\n\nformation and expression of virulence factors [12,13]. Bacteria\n\nsynthesize small, diffusible molecules to coordinate QS and a\n\nmajor signal generated by P. aeruginosa is N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)\n\nhomoserine lactone (C12, Figure 1A). In addition to regulating P.\n\naeruginosa responses, C12 activates host cell responses via a process\n\ntermed inter-kingdom signalling [14]. C12 is cytotoxic in a dose\n\ndependent manner in macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts and\n\nepithelial cells [15,16,17,18]. Additional C12-activated host\n\nresponses include phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated\n\nprotein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation\n\ninitiation factor 2a (eIF2a) and synthesis of c-jun mRNA [17]. C12\nrepresses transcriptional activation of nuclear factor k-light chain-\nenhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) -responsive genes in\nstimulated macrophages, T-cells and fibroblasts [19,20,21]. In\n\ncontrast, C12 has also been reported to intrinsically activate pro-\n\ninflammatory responses, including elevation of prostaglandin E2\n\nand cyclooxygenase 2 levels, in certain cell types [22,23]. Finally,\n\nC12 affects calcium homeostasis by releasing calcium stores from\n\nthe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [18,24,25].\n\nKnowledge of how host cells recognize and respond to C12 is\n\nincomplete, although it is believed that C12 may interact with\n\nmultiple host targets in a cell-type dependent manner [14]. The\n\nbitter taste receptor T2R38 was recently demonstrated to\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576\n\n\n\nrecognize C12 [26]. Stimulation of T2R38 by C12 activates\n\nmucociliary clearance and nitric oxide production to facilitate\n\nbacterial clearance and killing in primary airway epithelial cultures\n\n[26]. Polymorphisms in the T2R38 gene associated with Gram-\n\nnegative sinonasal infections were demonstrated to reduce airway\n\nresponsiveness to C12 indicating that C12\u2013host interactions are\n\npathologically relevant [26]. C12 is cell permeable and members\n\nof the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor nuclear hormone\n\nreceptor family have been proposed to respond to C12 [27]. In\n\ncontrast, it has been suggested that C12 and other similar acyl\n\nhomoserine lactones interact directly with host cell membranes to\n\nalter membrane polarity and consequently mediate cellular\n\nresponses [28]. Although innate immune system receptors are\n\ncapable of recognizing diverse pathogen-derived molecules, Toll-\n\nlike receptors (TLRs) and the nucleotide-binding, oligomerization\n\ndomain (NOD)-like receptors Nod1 and Nod2 are not required for\n\nC12 recognition [17].\n\nThe overall objective of this study was to gain insight into how\n\nC12 causes cell death. Several C12-induced cellular responses,\n\nincluding morphological changes to ER structure, phosphorylation\n\nof eIF2a and disruption of calcium homeostasis, are characteristic\nof ER stress [17,24,25]. ER stress typically activates intrinsic\n\napoptosis [29,30] and additional C12-initiated responses including\n\ncytochrome c release, mitochondrial depolarization and caspase 9\n\nactivation, suggest that this pathway is involved in C12 cytotoxicity\n\n[17,18,25]. As such, we tested the hypothesis that ER stress\n\ninitiates C12-mediated cell death. Unexpectedly, these studies\n\nidentified the X box-binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s)\n\nas a major regulator of C12-mediated cell death. In this study, we\n\nreport that: (i) XBP1s regulates C12 cytotoxicity by a novel, non-\n\ntranscriptional mechanism; (ii) XBP1s mediates cellular responses\n\nto C12 and similar acyl homoserine lactones in a cell type-\n\nindependent manner and; (iii) C12-mediated cellular responses\n\noccur via XBP1s-dependent and independent pathways.\n\nResults\n\nDeletion of inositol-requiring enzyme 1a is protective\nagainst C12-mediated cell death\n\nThree sensors monitor ER protein folding stress; PERK (protein\n\nkinase RNA-like ER kinase), IRE1a (inositol-requiring enzyme 1a)\nand ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) [30,31]. Of these\n\nsensors, PERK and IRE1a have been associated with ER stress-\nactivated apoptotic responses [31,32,33]. Therefore, to investigate\n\nthe role of ER stress response pathways in C12 cytotoxicity, wild\n\ntype (wt) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and knockout\n\nMEFs that do not express PERK (Perk2/2) or IRE1a (Ire1a2/2)\nwere challenged with C12 and cytotoxic responses characterized.\n\nSignificant cell death was observed in C12-treated wt MEFs\n\n(,40% at 4 hours), as assessed by comparison of cell labelling with\nthe supravital dye calcein before and after C12-treatment\n\n(Figure 1B, first panels, and Figure 1C). The response of Perk2/2\n\nMEFs to C12 was similar to that in wt MEFs indicating that C12\n\ncytotoxicity is not dependent upon PERK activity (Figure 1B, third\n\npanels, and Figure 1C). In contrast, Ire1a2/2 MEFs were resistant\nto C12 cytotoxicity suggesting that C12-induced cell death is\n\nIRE1a-dependent (Figure 1B, fourth panels, and Figure 1C). RT-\nPCR and western blot analysis was performed to verify the identity\n\nof knockout cell lines used in these studies (Figure 1B, right).\n\nCaspase (cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease) acti-\n\nvation has previously been implicated in C12-mediated cell death\n\n[17,18]; however, caspases have not definitively been demonstrat-\n\ned to mediate C12 cytotoxicity. As such, caspase activity in C12-\n\nchallenged MEFs was characterized to further investigate the\n\nmechanism of C12 cytotoxicity. In wt MEFs, the pan-caspase\n\ninhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited C12-cytotoxicity (,90% cells\nremained at 4 hours) suggesting that cell death requires caspase\n\nactivation (Figure 1B, second panels and Figure 1C, grey bar). Several\n\nfamilies of cysteine proteases can be inhibited by z-VAD-fmk;\n\nhowever, inhibition of cathepsin B (CA-074-Me) or calpain\n\n(ALLN) did not reduce C12 toxicity in wt MEFs (Figure S1A).\n\nAs such, z-VAD-fmk effects in C12-treated MEFs were caspase\n\nspecific and C12 cytotoxicity is dependent upon caspase activa-\n\ntion. Direct measurements of executioner caspase (caspase 3 and 7)\n\nactivity in MEF cell lines stimulated with 25 mM C12 indicated\nthat Ire1a deletion dramatically reduced caspase activation relative\nto wt and Perk2/2 MEFs (Figure 1D). Reported concentrations of\n\nC12 in liquid culture and biofilms vary from 5 to 600 mM [21,34];\ntherefore, we assessed caspase activation in wt MEFs in response\n\nto low C12 concentrations (Figure 1E and Figure S1B).\n\nExecutioner caspase activation was significantly enhanced by\n\n4 hour treatment with low C12 concentration (5 mM and 10 mM\nC12 produced ,2-fold and ,5-fold increases respectively) and\nprogressively increased with higher C12 doses. Taken together,\n\nthese studies indicate that C12-cytotoxicity in MEFs: (i) requires\n\ncaspases such that cell death can formally be classified as\n\napoptosis, (ii) is highly dependent on IRE1a activity and, (iii) is\nindependent of PERK activity.\n\nIRE1a deletion indirectly prevents C12 apoptosis\nIRE1a is a transmembrane protein that resides in the ER and\n\ncontains cytoplasmic kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activ-\n\nities [30,35]. During homeostatic conditions, IRE1a RNase\nactivity is limited, although it does mediate sequence specific,\n\nnon-conventional splicing of a pre-mRNA (Xbp1u) to generate\n\nmature mRNA (Xbp1s) that encodes the X-box binding protein 1\n\ntranscription factor (XBP1s) [30,33,35]. Xbp1u pre-mRNA also\n\nencodes XBP1u protein that binds to and regulates XBP1s stability\n\n[36]; the internal location of the Xbp1u splice site dictates that\n\nXBP1u and XBP1s share a common amino terminus. During\n\nperiods of irremediable ER stress, as observed in pathological\n\nconditions such as neurodegeneration and type II diabetes, IRE1a\nbecomes hyper-activated leading to apoptosis driven by promis-\n\ncuous IRE1a RNase activity and/or activation of apoptosis signal-\nregulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and its downstream target c-jun NH2-\n\nterminal kinase (JNK) [33,37,38,39].\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nChronic and acute infections associated with P. aeruginosa\nconstitute a major healthcare burden. Antimicrobial\napproaches are currently used against P. aeruginosa;\nhowever, infections are typically refractory to treatment\nand drug resistant strains have been isolated. As such,\nthere is urgent need to understand mechanisms of P.\naeruginosa virulence and for new strategies to fight\ninfections. The P. aeruginosa-derived quorum-sensing\nmolecule C12 is recognized by host cells and initiates\nstress responses including cytotoxicity. In this study, the X-\nbox binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s) was\nidentified as a host factor critical for apoptotic responses\ninitiated by C12 and other similar quorum sensing\nmolecules. Additional C12-initiated host responses, includ-\ning phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eIF2a were found to\nbe of lesser importance for C12-initiated cytotoxicity.\nThese studies have broad implications for our understand-\ning of bacterial virulence mechanisms and for develop-\nment of potential new strategies to combat infections.\n\nXBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576\n\n\n\nTreatment of wt MEFs with STF-083010, a selective and\n\nirreversible inhibitor of IRE1a RNase activity [39,40], did not\ninhibit C12-mediated toxicity or caspase 3/7 activation (Figure 2A,\n\nleft and Figure 2B). Similarly, treatment of wt MEFs with a JNK\n\ninhibitor (SP600125) did not reduce C12 cytotoxicity (Figure 2A,\n\nright) or activation of caspase 3/7 (Figure S1C). A prerequisite for\n\nIRE1a-mediated apoptotic signalling is IRE1a activation, a\nprocess that involves oligomerization and trans-autophosphory-\n\nlation [33,37]. Therefore, to further investigate a possible role of\n\nIRE1a in C12-mediated cytotoxic responses, IRE1a activity was\ndirectly assessed using a luciferase-based reporter (XBP1-luc). The\n\nXBP1-luc reporter encodes cDNA containing the Xbp1u pre-\n\nmRNA splice site fused upstream of a luciferase gene ([41], see also\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS). In the absence of IRE1a\nactivity, an \u2018in-frame\u2019 stop codon prevents luciferase expression\n\n(Figure 2C, top left); however, upon IRE1a-mediated pre-mRNA\nsplicing (which removes 26 nucleotides), the stop codon is shunted\n\n\u2018out-of-frame\u2019 and luciferase is expressed to report IRE1a activity\n(Figure 2C, bottom left). In wt MEFs expressing XBP1-luc, IRE1a\nactivity was not increased above control levels after 2 hours of C12\n\nstimulation (Figure 2C, right). In contrast, exposure of cells to\n\nthapsigargin, a known ER stress-inducing agent, produced\n\nsignificant enhancement of IRE1a activity over the same time\nframe (Figure 2C, right). Treatment of wt MEFs for 2 hours with\n\nC12 or thapsigargin produced relatively little cell loss (,10%,\n\nFigure S1A). Data obtained in an additional cell type suggested\n\nthat the absence of significant IRE1a activation in response to C12\nstimulation is a generalized phenomenon (Figure S1D). In\n\nsummary, these studies: (i) provide pharmacological evidence that\n\nIRE1a is not directly involved in C12-mediated cytotoxicity and,\n(ii) demonstrate that C12 stimulation of cells does not significantly\n\nactivate the IRE1a ER stress sensor.\nIre1a2/2 MEFs synthesize Xbp1u pre-mRNA; however, Xbp1u\n\nsplicing and XBP1s protein are undetectable in this cell type\n\nindicating that IRE1a is uniquely responsible for processing of\nXbp1u pre-mRNA in MEFs ([33,42], see also Figure S2A). As such,\n\nC12 cytotoxic responses were assessed directly in Xbp12/2 MEFs\n\nto test the hypothesis that reduced C12 cytotoxicity in Ire1a2/2\n\nMEFs results from loss of XBP1s function(s). C12 stimulation of\n\nXbp12/2 MEFs produced little apparent reduction in cell density\n\nFigure 1. Deletion of Ire1a prevents C12 cytotoxicity. A.

As such, these studies\n\nindicate that C12 cytotoxicity requires the presence of XBP1s and\n\nthat reduced levels of the XBP1s do not merely alter the kinetics or\n\nsensitivity of cellular responses to C12.\n\nTo investigate whether XBP1s loss-of-function was directly\n\nresponsible for C12 tolerance, Xbp12/2 and Ire1a2/2 MEFs were\ntransiently transfected with Xbp1 cDNA and responses to C12\n\nwere characterized. As predicted from direct measurement of\n\nexecutioner caspase activation, treatment of wt MEFs with C12\n\nproduced robust caspase 3-cleavage that could be detected by\n\nimmunostaining (Figure 3A). Similarly, as expected from mea-\n\nsurements of executioner caspase activity, cleaved caspase 3 was\n\nessentially absent in C12-stimulated Xbp12/2 and Ire1a2/2 MEFs\n(Figure 3B and C, left panels). Transfection of Xbp12/2 MEFs with\n\ncDNA encoding either Xbp1u pre-mRNA (which can be processed\n\nby IRE1a; Figure 3B, middle) or Xbp1s mRNA (Figure 3B, right)\nrestored caspase 3 cleavage upon C12 treatment in a large number\n\nof cells. In contrast, transfection of Ire1a2/2 MEFs with Xbp1s\ncDNA (Figure 3C right), but not Xbp1u cDNA (which is present\n\nendogenously but remains unspliced, Figure 3C, middle), restored\n\ncaspase-3 cleavage upon C12 treatment. In control experiments,\n\nC12-treatment of Xbp12/2 MEFs transfected with an empty\n\nplasmid was not associated with caspase 3-cleavage, verifying that\n\ntransfection of this cell type was not responsible for caspase\n\nactivation (Figure S1F). Taken together, these experiments\n\nindicate that expression of XBP1s in XBP1s-deficient MEFs\n\n(Xbp12/2 or Ire1a2/2 MEFs) is sufficient to re-establish C12-\nmediated caspase cleavage.\n\nC12-mediated apoptosis does not require XBP1s\ntranscriptional activity\n\nXBP1s is a member of the cAMP response element-binding\n\nprotein (CREB)/ATF basic region\u2013leucine zipper family of\n\ntranscription factors and, consistent with this function, XBP1s is\n\nmodular containing a polybasic region, a leucine zipper motif and\n\na transcriptional activation domain [36] (Figure 4B). Therefore,\n\nexperiments were conducted to investigate whether XBP1s\n\ntranscriptional activity was required for C12-mediated apoptosis.\n\nTreatment of wt MEFs with inhibitors of transcription (actino-\n\nmycin) or translation (cycloheximide) during C12 stimulation did\n\nnot prevent caspase activation (Figure 4A). As such, in response to\n\nC12-stimulation, neither acute activation of XBP1s transcriptional\n\nactivity nor acute protein synthesis of an XBP1s-dependent\n\ntranscript are responsible for C12-induced apoptosis.\n\nTo gain insight into the role of XBP1s domains in C12-\n\nmediated apoptosis, a series of XBP1s truncation constructs were\n\ngenerated (Figure 4B). In wt MEFs, XBP1s is predominantly\n\nlocalized to the nucleus, although in agreement with prior\n\nbiochemical analysis, low levels of XBP1s could also be detected\n\nin the cytoplasm [36] (Figure 4C and Figure S2B). Deletion of the\n\namino terminus and polybasic region from XBP1s produced a\n\ntruncation construct (XBP1D1) that was distributed throughout the\n\ncell (Figure 4B and 4C). When expressed in Ire1a2/2 or Xbp12/2\n\nMEFs, XBP1D1 was able to re-establish caspase 3 cleavage upon\n\nC12 treatment (Figure 4D, left). In a similar manner, an XBP1s\n\ntruncation construct that consisted of only the leucine zipper and\n\ntranscriptional activation domains (XBP1D2) was distributed\n\nthroughout the cell (Figure 4B and 4C) and restored caspase 3\n\ncleavage in C12-stimulated Ire1a2/2 and Xbp12/2 MEFs\n(Figure 4D, middle). A truncation construct encompassing the\n\namino-terminal domains of XBP1s (XBP1N, Figure 4B) failed to\n\nre-establish caspase 3 cleavage in C12 stimulated Ire1a2/2 or\nXbp12/2 MEFs (Figure 4D, right). As such, consideration of C12-\n\nmediated caspase 3-cleavage in XBP1s-deficient MEFs expressing\n\nXBP1D2 or XBP1N suggested that the transcriptional activation\n\ndomain of XBP1s contains a protein sequence that is responsible\n\nfor C12-mediated caspase activation. However, instability of\n\nadditional XBP1s truncation constructs that were generated\n\nprecluded further analysis to identify a minimal XBP1s region\n\nthat is necessary for C12-mediated caspase 3-cleavage. For\n\ninstance, truncation constructs such as those that encode the\n\nXBP1s transcriptional activation domain and carboxy-terminus or\n\nthe XBP1s transcriptional activation domain alone could not be\n\ndetected by immunocytochemistry or western blot analysis (Figure\n\nS2C and data not shown). As such, our analysis indicates that the\n\nleucine zipper and transcriptional activation domains of XBP1s\n\n(XBP1D2) constitute a minimal XBP1s region that can be stably\n\nexpressed and is sufficient for caspase activation in C12-treated\n\nIre1a2/2 or Xbp12/2 MEFs.\nNext, experiments were performed to assess the ability of XBP1s\n\ntruncation constructs to mediate transcriptional activity. In these\n\nassays, wt MEFs were co-transfected with an XBP1s-responsive\n\nluciferase reporter and either XBP1s or an XBP1s truncation\n\nconstruct [43,44]. As expected, robust transcriptional responses\n\nwere observed when XBP1s was co-expressed with the reporter\n\n(Figure 4E). In contrast, XBP1N, which lacks a transcriptional\n\nactivation domain, was not associated with transcriptional activity\n\n(Figure 4E). The XBP1D1 and XBP1D2 truncation constructs that\n\nrestore caspase 3-cleavage in C12-treated Ire1a2/2 and Xbp12/2\n\nMEFs were also not associated with XBP1s-dependent transcrip-\n\ntional activity (Figure 4E and Figure S2A). Taken together, these\n\nstudies indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nactivation domains of XBP1s (XBP1D2) constitute a minimal,\n\nstable XBP1s fragment that restores caspase activation upon C12\n\nstimulation in XBP1s-deficient cells and; (ii) C12-mediated\n\napoptosis does not require XBP1s-transcriptional activity.\n\nXBP1s regulates a common mechanism for acyl\nhomoserine lactone-mediated caspase activation\n\nAcyl homoserine lactones are a common chemical scaffold used\n\nby diverse bacterial species for QS [12]. Therefore, experiments\n\nwere performed to investigate if XBP1s-dependent mechanisms\n\nmediate cellular responses to N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserine\n\nlactone (C14, Figure 5A), a QS molecule generated by the gram-\n\nnegative, pathogenic bacteria Yersinia enterolitica and Burkholderia\n\npseudomallei. Treatment of wt MEFs with C14 produced significant\n\ncell death, as assessed by calcein AM fluorescence (Figure 5B, left),\n\nand activation of executioner caspases (Figure 5C, right). In\n\ncontrast, Ire1a2/2 MEFs were largely resistant to C14-mediated\ncytotoxicity (Figure 5B, right) and demonstrated significantly\n\nreduced caspase activation (,20%) relative to wt cells\n(Figure 5C, right). As expected from direct measurements of\n\ncaspase activity, robust cleavage of caspase 3 could be detected in\n\nXBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576\n\n\n\nC14-treated wt MEFs; however, cleaved caspase 3 immunostain-\n\ning was largely absent in Ire1a2/2 MEFs (Figure 5D). Transfection\nof Ire1a2/2 MEF cells to express either XBP1s or XBP1D2\nrestored caspase 3-cleavage in C14 treated cells (Figure 5D), as\n\nobserved in C12-treated cells.\n\nStudies were also performed to investigate whether XBP1D2\naffects cytotoxic response to acyl homoserine lactones in other cell\n\ntypes. A Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cell line was generated that was\n\nhighly enriched for expression of XBP1D2 (FRT-XBP1D2,\n\nFigure 5E, left). Treatment of FRT-XBP1D2 with C12 or C14\n\nresulted in increased activation of executioner caspases relative to\n\ncontrol cells (FRTcon, Figure 5E, right). Similarly, enhanced\n\ncaspase activation was observed in a Hela cell line enriched for\n\nXBP1D2 expression upon treatment with C12 or C14 (Figure 5F).\n\nIt is noteworthy that in all cell types studied C14 produced higher\n\nlevels of caspase activation than C12. Studies with further acyl\n\nhomoserine lactones indicated that acyl chains of .12 carbon\n\natoms and substitution at the third carbon of the acyl chain are\n\nrequired for toxicity (Figure S3). Taken together, these experi-\n\nments indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nactivation domains (XBP1D2) of XBP1s regulate activation of\n\ncaspases in response to different homoserine lactones and, (ii)\n\nXBP1D2 results in increased caspase activation in the presence of\n\nendogenous XBP1s.\n\nC12 activates alternative cellular responses via XBP1s-\nindependent mechanisms\n\nC12 activates multiple stress response signalling pathways in\n\nhost cells [14,17]. The observation that Ire1a2/2 and Xbp12/2\n\nMEFs are protected from C12-induced cell death afforded the\n\nopportunity to investigate whether distinct cellular signalling\n\nresponses are associated with or unrelated to C12 cytotoxicity.\n\nPhosphorylation of eIF2a and p38 MAPK have previously been\nreported in primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells\n\n[17]. In agreement with this study, increased phospho-eIF2a (p-\neIF2a; ,2.5-fold change) and phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38\nMAPK; ,2.5-fold change) could also be detected in wt MEFs\nafter C12 exposure for 45 minutes (Figure 6A, top panels). A similar\n\npattern of phosphorylation of eIF2a and p38 MAPK was observed\nin C12-treated Ire1a2/2 and Xbp12/2 MEFs (Figure 6A, middle and\nbottom panels; ,2.5 and ,3-fold increases in p-eIF2a, and ,2.5\n\nFigure 2.

As both\nIre1a2/2 and Xbp12/2 MEFs are resistant to C12 cytotoxicity,\nthese studies also suggest that phosphorylation of p-eIF2a and p-\np38 MAPK does not contribute greatly to C12-mediated cell\n\ndeath in MEFs. Consistent with this notion, inhibition of p38\n\nMAPK activity (using SB203580 or SB202190) did not inhibit C12\n\ncytotoxicity or caspase 3/7 activation in wt MEFs (data not\n\nshown).\n\nPERK phosphorylates eIF2a during periods of ER stress [32];\ntherefore, experiments were performed to investigate whether\n\nPERK is activated by C12. Phosphorylation of eIF2a was,\nhowever, preserved in C12-treated Perk2/2 MEFs (Figure 6B,\n\ntop; ,3-fold increase). As expected, control experiments confirmed\nthat ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA) produced p-eIF2a in\nwt MEFs (,4-fold increase) but not Perk2/2 MEFs (,0.9-fold\nchange) (Figure 6B, middle and bottom). Together, these studies\n\nindicate that C12 challenge activates alternative kinase(s) activity\n\nto generate p-eIF2a; however, they do not formally demonstrate\nthat PERK does not contribute to eIF2a phosphorylation.\n\nLevels of c-jun mRNA have also been reported to increase in\n\nC12-treated primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells\n\n[17]. In wt MEFs, c-Jun protein levels increased by approximately\n\ntwo-fold after 90 minutes treatment with 25 mM C12 (Figure 6C,\nleft, and Figure 6D). In contrast, c-Jun protein levels were not\n\naltered by C12 in Ire1a2/2 or Xbp12/2 MEFs (Figure 6C, middle\n\nFigure 3.

At present, these studies cannot\n\ndistinguish whether c-Jun levels increase in wt MEFs in an XBP1s\n\n(or IRE1a) -dependent manner or due to C12-mediated cytotox-\nicity; however, these studies confirm that C12 cytotoxicity is\n\nassociated with increased c-Jun levels. It is noteworthy that in\n\nunstimulated conditions, c-Jun levels in wt and knockout MEFs\n\nvaried by approximately three-fold; as such, elevated levels of c-\n\nJun, at least in the absence of XBP1s, are not sufficient to mediate\n\nC12 cytotoxicity. These studies indicate that C12-mediated host\n\ncell responses occur via both XBP1s-dependent and -independent\n\nmechanisms and C12-mediated production of p-eIF2a and p-p38\nMAPK in MEFs does not contribute greatly to cell death.\n\nDiscussion\n\nInfections associated with P. aeruginosa result in significant\n\nmortality and constitute a major worldwide healthcare burden.\n\nOur understanding of P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms is\n\nlimited and there is an urgent need to identify new approaches\n\nthat can be employed to reduce P. aeruginosa infectivity. P.\n\naeruginosa employ QS to regulate growth, virulence factor\n\nexpression and biofilm formation. In addition to quorum\n\nsignalling, P. aeruginosa-derived C12 homoserine lactone activates\n\nseveral host cell responses including cytotoxicity. The major\n\nconclusion of this study is that C12-mediated host cell cytotoxic\n\nresponses largely require expression of the XBP1s transcription\n\nfactor (Figure 7). Cell death and caspase activation were\n\ndramatically reduced (,95%) in cells that cannot generate\nXBP1s (Ire1a2/2 MEFs) or lack the XBP1 gene (Xbp12/2 MEFs).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first\n\ndescription of cells that are C12-tolerant due to genetic ablation\n\nof a protein. Restoring XBP1s expression in either Ire1a2/2 or\nXbp12/2 MEFs was sufficient to re-establish caspase 3 cleavage\n\nupon C12 stimulation. Although the present study does not\n\nprovide full mechanistic detail, we demonstrate that a fragment of\n\nXBP1s encompassing the leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nFigure 4.

Cellular responses, including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK\n\nand eIF2a were reported in cells exposed to 5\u201310 mM C12 [17]. In\nvivo studies indicate that low concentrations of C12 (1\u201310 mM)\nproduce profound responses [46]. Furthermore, it has been\n\nproposed that host cells may be exposed to high local C12\n\nconcentrations generated by P. aeruginosa structures including\n\nmicro-colonies and biofilms [47,48]. The only rigorous validated\n\nC12 receptor is T2R38, this bitter taste receptor is activated by\n\nC12 to stimulate host antimicrobial responses including nitric\n\noxide synthesis and mucociliary clearance [26].

In general, these studies\n\nindicate that XBP1s typically acts in a protective manner to restore\n\ncellular homeostasis when protein load on the ER is excessive [35].\n\nXBP1s function has, however, been linked to cell death and over\n\nlong time courses (days) increased levels of XBP1s have been\n\nassociated with apoptosis in endothelial and pancreatic b cells\n[56,57]. The current study represents the first descriptions of an\n\nunconventional (non-transcriptional) role for XBP1s and of a\n\nfunction for XBP1s in regulating acute apoptosis.\n\nAdditional insights into the role of cell stress response pathways\n\nin C12 stimulated cells are afforded by the present study\n\n(summarized in Figure 7). Activation of ER stress response\n\npathways has been proposed as a mechanism by which C12\n\ninitiates host cell responses [14,48]. Direct assessment of IRE1a\nsplicing activity and pharmacological inhibition of apoptotic\n\npathways that are initiated by IRE1a suggests that C12 does not\nactivate IRE1a. An additional inference that can be drawn from\nthese observations is that \u2018house-keeping\u2019 levels of XBP1s are\n\nsufficient to mediate apoptotic responses to C12. However, it is\n\nnoteworthy that immune responses initiated by P. aeruginosa (via\n\nTLR4 and TLR5) will result in IRE1a-activation and increased\nlevels of XBP1s [58]. ER stress-induced PERK activation has also\n\nbeen proposed to be responsible for C12-mediated eIF2a\nphosphorylation; however, robust eIF2a phosphorylation was\nobserved in Perk2/2 MEFs suggesting that an alternative kinase(s)\n\ncatalyzes this response. Although the present studies do not\n\nformally rule out PERK-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation, this\nscenario seems unlikely given that: (i) C12-mediated IRE1a ER\nstress responses are negligible, (ii) PERK and IRE1a sense ER\nstress by a similar mechanism [59] and, (iii) deletion of PERK does\n\nnot alter cytotoxic responses to C12. In response to cell stress,\n\neIF2a is also phosphorylated by eIF2a kinase 1 (the heme-\nregulated inhibitor kinase), eIF2a kinase 2 (protein kinase RNA-\nactivated, PKR) or eIF2a kinase 4 (GCN2) [60]; further work will\nbe required to establish which eIF2a kinase(s) responds to C12.\nThe role of individual stress response pathways to overall C12-\n\nmediated cytotoxicity is not well understood. The observations\n\nthat p38 MAPK phosphorylation is conserved in Ire1a2/2 and\nXbp12/2 MEFs and that pharmacological inhibition of p38\n\nMAPK does not prevent C12-mediated apoptosis suggest that this\n\npathway is of limited importance to C12-mediated cell death.\n\nSimilarly, eIF2a phosphorylation is preserved in Ire1a2/2 and\nXbp12/2 MEFs also suggesting that this cellular response has little\n\nrelevance to C12-mediated apoptosis. Finally, it is noteworthy that\n\ncaspases are activated in Ire1a2/2 and Xbp12/2 MEFs in response\nto C12-stimulation, albeit at dramatically reduced levels (,5%)\nrelative to wt MEFs. As such, our study indicates that XBP1s-\n\ndependent and -independent processes that contribute to caspase\n\nactivation are initiated in C12-stimulated cells, but that XBP1s-\n\ndependent mechanisms are dominant.\n\nHow might XBP1s contribute to cell death in C12-stimulated\n\ncells? Our study formally verifies that caspase activation mediates\n\napoptotic cell death in MEFs. Executioner caspase activity was\n\nostensibly used as a metric of cell death; however, caspase 8 was\n\nalso activated in C12-stimulated MEFs (data not shown) as\n\npreviously reported in other cell types [16,18]. Caspase 8\n\nactivation typically indicates that extrinsic apoptotic pathways\n\ninitiated by cell surface receptors are operating [29]. As such, we\n\nspeculate that XBP1s promotes initiation of extrinsic apoptotic\n\nresponses through formation of the death-inducing signalling\n\ncomplex in a C12-dependent manner. Precedents of leucine\n\nzipper-containing proteins causing intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis\n\nhave been reported. Similar to XBP1s, the prostrate apoptosis\n\nresponse-4 protein (Par-4) contains a leucine zipper motif and\n\nnuclear localization sequences. Depending upon cell type, Par-4\n\nhas been demonstrated to either sensitize cellular responses to\n\napoptotic stimuli or to directly activate apoptosis; however, the\n\nmechanism of these responses is not fully elucidated [61]. Further\n\nstudies will be required to test the hypothesis that XBP1s mediates\n\nactivation of extrinsic apoptotic responses in a C12-dependent\n\nfashion.\n\nIn summary, the present study identifies XBP1s as a key\n\ndeterminant of apoptotic responses initiated by QS molecule\n\ngenerated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterolitica and Burk-\n\nholderia pseudomallei. The leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nactivation domains of XBP1 are sufficient to mediate apoptotic\n\nresponses; however, XBP1s transcriptional activity is not required\n\nfor cell death. These studies advance our understanding of host\n\nresponses to C12 and should facilitate rational design of\n\napproaches to investigate whether C12-mediated host cell\n\napoptosis is pathologically relevant.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell lines and cell culture\nImmortalized wt and knockout MEF cell lines used in this study\n\nwere previously described and RT-PCR analysis of these cells was\n\nperformed using published primer sequences [32,33,37,39]. MEFs\n\nwere cultured in DMEM H21 supplemented with 10% fetal\n\nbovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml\nstreptomycin and nonessential amino acids. Fischer rat thyroid\n\n(FRT) epithelial cells were obtained from the UCSF cell culture\n\nfacility and cultured in Ham\u2019s F12 supplemented as for MEFs.\n\nHela cells were obtained from the UCSF cell culture facility and\n\ncultured in DMEM H21 supplemented as for MEFs. MEF and\n\nFRT cells were transfected using jetPRIME (Polyplus Transfec-\n\ntion) and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX\n\nwith Plus reagent (Life Technologies).\n\nReagents and chemicals\nHomoserine lactones (including C12 (N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-\n\nhomoserine lactone) and C14 (N-(3-oxodotetradecanoyl)-L-homo-\n\nserine lactone)) were obtained from Sigma. For some experiments,\n\nC12 was prepared using a previously described synthetic route\n\n[62]. Structure and purity (.99%) of synthesized C12 were\n\nconfirmed by proton NMR, and caspase activation in wt or\n\nXbp12/2 MEFs was similar in response to synthesized or\n\npurchased C12. Details of homoserine lactone dosing is provided\n\nin Figure Legends or text. Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM),\n\nDAPI and thapsigargin was obtained from Life Technologies and\n\nused as directed by the manufacturer. Pharmacological modula-\n\ntors were purchased from various sources (as detailed below) and\n\ncells were typically pre-treated with compounds for 30 minutes, at\n\nconcentrations given in parenthesis, prior to homoserine lactone\n\nchallenge or other experimental maneuvers. Cycloheximide\n\n(5 mg/ml) and CA-074-Me (10 mM) were obtained from Calbio-\nchem. STF-080310 (50 mM) was obtained from Tocris. Z-VAD-\nfmk (10 mM) was obtained from Promega. SB203580 (10 mM),\nSB202190 (10 mM), SP600125 (10 mM), ALLN (10 mM), brefeldin\nA (1.25 mg/ml) and actinomycin (1 mg/ml) were obtained from\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology.\n\nAntibodies, western blotting and immunocytochemistry\nAntibodies against, IRE1a, PERK, cleaved and full length\n\ncaspase 3 and 7, p-eIF2a, p-p38 MAPK and c-Jun were obtained\n\nXBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 10 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576\n\n\n\nfrom Cell Signalling. Antibody against XBP1 was purchased from\n\nSanta Cruz. Antibody against FLAG-tag was obtained from\n\nSigma. Western blotting was performed using standard procedures\n\nwith chemiluminescence detection. Immunocytochemistry was\n\nperformed on fixed and permeabilized cells using indirect\n\nimmunodetection with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated sec-\n\nondary antibodies and DAPI as a counterstain. Imaging was\n\nperformed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope\n\nequipped with an Exfo X-Cite light source, Hamamatsu EM-CCD\n\ndeep-cooled camera and appropriate filter cubes and objectives\n\n(Nikon S Fluor 206N.A. 0.75 or Plan Fluor 406N.A. 0.75). For\nquantitative immunodetection, cell from different experiments\n\nwere labelled in parallel, imaged with identical microscope settings\n\nand analyzed using Fiji image processing software.\n\nApoptosis assays and cell density analysis\nCaspase activity was measured using Caspase-Glo homoge-\n\nneous luminescent assays (Promega). In different experiments,\n\ncaspase activation in C12-treated wt MEFs varied by ,50% for\nundetermined reasons. As such, control experiments were always\n\nperformed and are presented, such that control data and\n\nexperimental maneuvers can be directly compared. Normalized\n\ncaspase activation data is presented as mean 6 S.D. for an\n\nindividual experiment (comprised of 6\u201312 individual measure-\n\nments), and is representative of at least duplicate experiments. To\n\ncharacterize cell density, cells were labelled with calcein-AM and\n\nimaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope\n\n(described above) equipped with a Nikon Plan Fluor 106/NA 0.3\nobjective. Relative cell number was calculated from background-\n\ncorrected, integrated fluorescence areas and cell density was\n\nderived by comparison of relative cell number before and after an\n\nexperimental maneuver. Data is presented as mean 6 S.E. and\n\nwas derived from 3\u20135 independent experiments in which 3\u20136 cell\n\nareas were imaged per experiment.\n\nPlasmids, molecular biology and luciferase-based\nreporter assays\n\nPlasmids containing FLAG-tagged murine XBP1u and XBP1s\n\ncDNA were obtained from Addgene (plasmids 21832 and 21833;\n\n[63]). For experiments, the coding regions for XBP1u and XBP1s\n\nwere excised as HindIII/XbaI fragments, subcloned into\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro, and an oligo duplex was used to regenerate\n\nthe FLAG-tag (amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDL). Carboxy-\n\nterminal FLAG-XBP1s truncations (Figure 4B) were generated by\n\npcr as HindIII/XbaI-tagged amplicons that were subcloned into\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro containing an in-frame FLAG-tag. The amino-\n\nterminal FLAG-XBP1s truncation (Figure 4B) was generated by\n\npcr as a BglII/EcoRI-tagged amplicon that was subcloned into the\n\nBamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1; for experiments, FLAG-tagged\n\nXBP1 amino terminus was subsequently subcloned into\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro as an NheI/XbaI fragment. Domain boundaries\n\nfor truncations were based on those previously reported for human\n\nXBP1s [36]. For FLAG-XBP1s, the polybasic, leucine zipper\n\n(which contains amino acids involved in transcription factor\n\ndimerization) and transcriptional activation domains start at\n\nArg76, Ala94 and Ala168, the transcriptional activation domain\n\nends at Val283 and the amino terminal domain ends at Iso197\n\n(corresponding to residues Arg68, Ala86, Ala160, Val275 and\n\nIso189 of untagged XBP1s). Sequence analysis was used to\n\nconfirm all constructs generated in this study. For experiments in\n\nMEFs that assessed the role of full length and truncated XBP1\n\nregions in caspase activation, pcDNA3.1/Hygro was used as a\n\ncontrol (empty) vector. Cell lines enriched for expression of an\n\nXBP1s deletion construct (XBP1D2, Figure 4B) were generated by\n\nrepeated culture of transfected cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin;\ncells transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro and selected in 300 mg/\nml hygromycin (FRTcon and Helacon) were used as a control.\n\nA luciferase-based reporter of IRE1a activity was generously\nprovided by Albert Koong (Stanford University). Briefly, this\n\nreporter (termed XBP1-luc) consists of cDNA encoding the first\n\n208 amino acids of human Xbp1, including a 26-nucleotide splice\n\nsite that is recognized by IRE1a, fused to firefly luciferase [41]. A\nplasmid-based vector was generated for the current studies by\n\nsubcloning reporter cDNA (provided in the pLPCX retroviral\n\nvector, Clontech) into pcDNA3.1/Hygro as a HindIII/NotI\n\nfragment. Assays of IRE1a splicing activity were performed in\ntransiently transfected wt MEFs or in an FRT cell population\n\nenriched for expression of the reporter construct by repeated\n\nculture of cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin. A luciferase based\nreporter of XBP1s activity was purchased (pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/\n\nHygro] (Promega)); this reporter contains five direct repeats of the\n\nsequence 59-ATCGAGACAGGTGCTGACGTGGCATTC-39\n\nand is similar to a previously described XBP1s-responsive reporter\n\n(UPRE/56ATF6GL3) [43,44]. Assays of XBP1 transcriptional\nactivity were performed in MEFs transiently transfected with\n\nplasmids expressing full length or truncated XBP1s (or\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro as a control) and pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/\n\nHygro] at a ratio of 9:1. Luciferase-based reporter assays were\n\nperformed using the Bright-Glo Assay system as directed by the\n\nmanufacturer (Promega).\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 A.

Co-transfection of wt and Xbp12/2 MEFs with Xbp1u\n\ncDNA produced limited transcriptional activity, consistent with\n\nthe ability of these cells to process Xbp1u pre-mRNA and generate\n\nXBP1s via IRE1a activity (as expected, intrinsic activity of IRE1a\nis limited such that XBP1s-transcriptional activity in Xbp1u\n\ntransfected cells is lower than that in Xbp1s transfected cells). In\n\ncontrast, Ire1a2/2 MEFs were unable to process Xbp1u cDNA\nsuch that no transcriptional activity was reported.

In addition, circulating anti-\nphosphoribosomal protein antibodies (anti-Ribos.P) were found to be associated with lupus nephritis.\nStudy objective: We have assessed the direct role of anti-Ribos.P in the development of glomerulone-\nphritis in-vitro and in animal models.\nStudy design: NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice were immunized with recombinant Ribos.P0 (rRibos.P).\nEvaluation of renal disease included mice evaluation for proteinuria and histologic analysis of the kidneys.\nAnti-Ribos.P monoclonal Ab was prepared from the rRibos.P immunized NZBxW/F1 mice by hybridoma\ntechnology. MAPKs expression was analyzed by MAPKs protein array and confirmed by real-time PCR and\nwestern blot. To elucidate whether anti-Ribos.P induce glomerulonephritis, na\u00efve C3H mice were\nimmunized with recombinant rRibos.P and the glomerulonephritis was followed up as described above.\nResults: The immunized NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice developed anti-Ribos.P which was cross reactive\nwith Sm and not dsDNA. The mice developed accelerated glomerulonephritis manifested by early pro-\nteinuria and immunoglobulin deposites in the mesangium of the kidneys. Anti-Ribos.P deposited in the\nglomerular mesangium were eluted from the kidney. The Ribos.P immunized na\u00efve C3H/Hen mice\ndeveloped glomerulonephritis manifested by circulating autoantibodies directed to Ribos.P, dsDNA and\nSm. The anti Ribos.P were cross reactive with Sm but not with dsDNA, and were deposited in the\nglomeruli. Interestingly these mice developed alopecia. In vitro. Primary mesangial cells exposed to\nmouse anti-Ribos.P mAb originated from the immunized lupus mice and to human anti-Ribos.P Abs,\ninduced activation of mesangial cells via p38a, JNK, AKT and HSP27 MAPKs expression pathway.\nConclusions: Our data show for the first time that anti-Ribos.P are nephritogenic autoantibodies, as\nillustrated by in-vitro and in-vivo experiments: a) They accelerate the development of glomerulone-\nphritis in lupus prone mice; b) They induce nephritis in na\u00efve mice. c) Anti-Ribos.P Abs trigger MAPKs\nexpression in primary mesangial cells. These data contribute a direct mechanistic link between anti-\nRibos.P and nephritis in lupus mice.\n\n\ufffd 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nAmong the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in systemic\nlupus erythematosus (SLE), nephritis occurs in 40e60% of SLE\nutoimmune Diseases, Sheba\n2 3 5308070.\nank), shoenfel@post.tau.ac.il\n\naper.\npatients. Because lupus nephritis progress into renal failure, it is a\nprincipal cause of death among SLE patients [1]. Glomerulone-\nphritis classification in SLE according to the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) comprises six histological classes. The Inter-\nnational Society of Nephrology (ISN) and the Renal Pathology So-\nciety (RPS), have published a newer, similar classification with the\naddition of \u201ca\u201d for active and \u201cc\u201d for chronic changes. The advantage\nof the ISN/RPS classification is that it supplies the information\nregarding the potential reversibility of the disease [2]. Renal fibrosis\nand subsequent renal failure are caused by recurrent inflammation\n\nDelta:1_given name\nDelta:1_surname\nDelta:1_given name\nDelta:1_surname\nDelta:1_given name\nDelta:1_surname\nDelta:1_given name\nDelta:1_surname\nmailto:mblank@post.tau.ac.il\nmailto:shoenfel@post.tau.ac.il\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2014.02.013&domain=pdf\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08968411\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/jautimm\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2014.02.013\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2014.02.013\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2014.02.013\n\n\nD. Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126 119\nand augmentation of local inflammatory responses, including the\ndeposition of immunoglobulins within the glomerular and tubular\nbasement membranes [3]. The lupus nephritis enigma for several\ndecades. In the late 1960s, using immunofluorescence, Koffler et al.\nshowed that immune complexes are involved in lupus nephritis\npathogenesis and they found anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in the\nkidneys of patients who presented with lupus nephritis [4].\n\nLupus nephritis is known to be associated with several anti-\nbodies, including autoantibodies that target the DNA (4), C1q and\nhistone, a-actinin [5e7], and the nucleosome [8]. dsDNA reactive\nantibodies are believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of\nlupus nephritis through three main mechanisms: a) tissue damage\ndue to the in-vitro mesangial cell penetration of anti-dsDNA anti-\nbodies which cross react with kidney antigens; b) the formation of\nanti-dsDNA antibodies immune complexes with DNA/nucleosomes,\nwhich are released from apoptotic cells; and c) in situ formation of\nanti-dsDNA antibodies and nucleosomes immune complexes [6,9].\nAdditionally, in a more recent study, researchers were able to show\nthat glomerular inflammation induction is strongly related to the\ndirect binding of anti-dsDNA antibodies to antigens in the glomer-\nular basement membrane or mesangial matrix [10].\n\nIn 1965, Sturgill and Carpenter [11] were the first to identify\nanti-Ribos.P Abs which target the intracellular ribosomal phos-\nphoprotein. Anti-Ribos.P Abs bind to three main ribosomal pro-\nteins: P0, P1 and P2 (38 kd, 19 kd and 17 kd), respectively [12].\nThese antibodies targets mainly the22 amino acids region, which is\nlocated at the carboxyl terminal end (C-22) of the ribosomal S60\nsubunit, This complex includes two copies each of P1 and P2 and a\nsingle copy of P0. The interaction of the pentameric complex with\nthe 28S rRNA molecule, creates the GTPase domain, which in turn\nplays a part in the elongation process of protein translation [13].\n\nAmong lupus patients, the reported prevalence of anti-Ribos.P\nAbs is 10e40%, with a high specificity of the Abs with neuropsy-\nchiatric SLE (NPSLE) [14,15]. Correlations between anti-Ribos.P Abs\nand neuropsychiatric clinical expressions include psychosis,\ndelirium, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and anxiety [16].\nAdditionally, intracerebroventricular administration of human\nanti-Ribos.P induced depression in na\u00efve mice [17].\n\nA link between anti-Ribos.P autoantibodies and nephritis,\nhepatitis and skin manifestations in lupus patients was reported\npreviously [18,19]. Anti-Ribos.P Abs have high specificity for SLE\n[20] with clear correlation to SLE disease activity. Moreover, the\npresence of these Abs was more prevalent in patients in which\nSLE appeared during adolescence compared to patients in whom\nthe disease developed at a later age [21].\n\nMeroni PL et al. first reported the association between anti-\nRibos.P Abs and renal injury in patients with lupus in 1984 [22]\nReichlin\u2019s group showed that in patients demonstrating anti-\nRibos.P Abs, lupus nephritis was significantly more prevalent than\nin those who were negative for these Abs [23]. This group also\ndemonstrated anti-Ribos.P Abs titer fluctuations, based on exacer-\nbation and remission intervals of the disease [24]. Several another\nstudies further showed that the simultaneous expression of anti-\ndsDNA Abs and anti-Ribos.P strongly correlate with lupus\nnephritis [21,25,26]. Furthermore, Bonfa et al. [27] proposed that\nanti-Ribos-P Abs may have a potential serologic marker for mem-\nbranous glomerulonephritis (class V) in SLE patients, while de\nMacedo et al. [28] suggested that during nephritis flares, in the\nabsence of anti-dsDNA, anti-Ribos.P Abs predict a better renal\nprognosis. Another group showed a high (but not significant) co-\npredominance in lupus nephritis class IV and V of anti-dsDNA\nAbs and anti-Ribos.P [29]. However, others showed no correlation\nbetween lupus nephritis and anti-Ribos.P Abs [30,31].\n\nIn our study, we report that anti-Ribos.P accelerate lupus\nnephritis in lupus prone mice and de novo induction of anti-\nRibos.P Abs cause renal injury and lupus skin manifestations.\nWe demonstrate the ability of anti-Ribos.P mAbs to bind\nmesangial cells and induce MAPKs, which can serve as an\nimportant mechanism for mediating renal tissue injury.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Antibodies\n\nThe following Abs were used in these studies:\nHuman anti-Ribos.P IgG Abs were affinity purified on a\n\nribosomal-P column from sera originated from a patient with\nNPSLE accompanied with nephritis as previously described [32].\nControl human IgG (h.cIgG) or mouse Ig1 were of commercial\norigin (m.cIgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West\nGrove, PA, USA)).\n\nGeneration of mouse anti-Ribos. mAbs: The mouse anti-Ribos.P\nmAbs were prepared as previously described by us (33). Spleen\ncells were isolated form three NZBxW/F1 rRibos.P immunized, 3\nmonths after the boost. The splenocytes were fusedwith themouse\nplasmacytoma cell line \ufffd63.653 at a ratio of 10:1 in the presence of\nPEG (polyethylene glycol) 1500, and seeded in 96 wells in HAT\nmedium using standard techniques as previously described by us\n[33]. The positive clones were subjected three times to a limiting\ndilution procedure. The anti-Ribos.P specific mAb detection was\nperformed by screening culture fluids on Ribos.P coated plates\n(AESKU) by ELISA, and on ELISA plates coated with synthetic pep-\ntide RIBOSPEP 50 mg/ml in PBS overnight at 4 \ufffdC. Scrambled\nRIBOSPEP peptide coated ELISA plates were used as control. The\nplates were blocked with 3%BSA in PBS 1 h at 37C. Following\n4 h incubation time with the tested culture fluid, the immuno-\nglobulin binding was probed with a goat-anti-mouse IgG-alkaline-\nphosphatase and later the appropriate substrate was added. Data\nwere read at OD 405 nm ref.650 nm. The selected mouse anti-\nRibos.P mAb M7/3 IgG1 bound specifically to Ribos.P in a dose\ndependent manner and the RIBOSPEP synthetic peptide (carboxy-\nterminal 22-amino acid of the ribosome.P as described below) was\nable to inhibit M7/3 mAb binding to Ribos.P by 97 \ufffd 8% at a con-\ncentration of 12 mg/ml in comparison to 3 \ufffd 2% in the presence of\nscRIBOPEP, P < 0.001 (Fig. 1).Commercial mouse IgG1 isotype\n(cmIgG) (Jackson) was used as negative control.\n\nGeneration of mouse anti-anti-Ribos. mAbs: C3H mice were\nimmunized with Ribos.P in CFA, The mice were boosted twice with\n2 weeks intervals with Ribos.P in incomplete Freuds adjuvant. Two\nweeks later the mice developed high titers of anti-anti-Ribos.P. IgG.\nThe sera was loaded on anti-Ribos.P mAb column and the eluted\nIgG was anti-anti-Ribos.P IgG.\n\n2.2. Synthetic peptides\n\nThe synthetic peptide is composed of the carboxy-terminal 22-\namino acid of the ribosome-P protein and has the following\nsequence: Lys-Lys-Glu-Glu-Lys-Lys-Glu-Glu-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-\nAsp-Glu-Asp-Met-Gly-Phe-Gly-Phe-Leu-Phe-OH named RIBO-\nSPEP. The control scrambled form of this peptide is: Met-Lys-Glu-\nLys-Glu-Glu-Ser-Lys-Phe-Asp-Gly-Glu-Asp-Glu-Glu-Leu-Phe -Glu-\nPhe-Lys-Gly-Glu-OH. The peptides were synthesized by GL-\nBiochem, Shanghai Ltd, Shanghai, China.\n\n2.3. Immunization\n\nFemale NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice at 12 weeks of age were\nobtained from The Harlan Laboratories (Bicester, UK). Female C3H/\nHen mice at 12 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Labo-\nratories (Rehovot, Israel). Mice were handled under protocols\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126120\napproved by the Sheba Medical Center Animal Care and The Israel\nMinistry of Health Committee according to international\nguidelines.\n\nNZBxW/F1 and C3H/Hen mice were immunized with recombi-\nnant ribosomal-P0 (rRibos.P0)(AESKU, Wendelsheim, Germany),\n10 mg/0.1 ml/mouse emulsion in Complete Freunds\u2019 Adjuvant (CFA)\ninto the hind footpads. Three weeks later a booster injection was\ngiven in PBS at the same location. NZBxW/F1 (n \u00bc 20) mice were\nimmunized with rRibos.P at the age of 12 weeks, boosted at the age\nof 15 weeks. Five mice were immunized with CFA and one group of\nNZBxW/F1 mice were not immunized. The C3H/Hen (n \u00bc 20) mice\nwere immunized at the age of 12 weeks using the same protocol\nand boosted at 15 weeks. C3H/Hen mice (n \u00bc 20) were immunized\nwith CFA.\n\n2.4. Detection of autoantibodies in mice sera\n\nMouse anti-dsDNA: Anti-dsDNA Abs binding in the mice sera\nwere detected by home-made ELISA as previously described by us\n[34]. Briefly, mice sera diluted 1:200 were applied to the dsDNA\ncoated ELISA plates, incubated for 60 min at room temperature.\nBound antibodies were probed by using alkaline phosphatase\nconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H \u00fe L) (Jackson) diluted 1:5000\nfollowed by appropriate substrate (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Data\nwere read by a Titertrek ELISA reader at 405 nm filter/620 nm\nreference filter.\n\nMouse anti-Ribos.P Abs were evaluated in the mice sera by\nemploying Anti-ribos.P kits (AESKU). Mice sera at a dilution of\n1:200 were added to the dilution buffer for 30 min at room tem-\nperature. The binding was probed with a goat anti-mouse IgG-\nperoxidase (Jackson) at a dilution 1:10,000, followed by an appro-\npriate substrate according to the manufacturer instructions. The\ndata were read at OD of 450 nm.\n\nMouse anti-Sm Abs were evaluated in the mice sera by using\nELISA coated and blocked Sm plates (INOVA, Diagnostic Inc. San-\nDiego, CA, USA) as described above for anti-Ribos.P.\n\nInhibition assays: Mouse anti-dsDNA Abs were affinity purified\nfrom sera of NZBxW/F1 mice and C3H/Hen mice, immunized with\nrRibos.P, on a cellulose column as previously described by us (34).\nInhibition assays were performed using affinity purified anti-\ndsDNA Abs, IgG from NZBxW/F1 mice immunized with Ribos.P,\nafter depletion of anti-dsDNA on a cellulose column, followed by\nprotein affinity purification and anti-Ribos.P mAb, all at 50% bind-\ning to the specific plate. dsDNA, and Ribosomal-P were used as\ninhibitors at different concentrations (5e50 mg/ml), for dsDNA\nbinding and Sm/RNP binding by ELISA.\n\n2.5. Evaluation of renal disease\n\nMice were evaluated for proteinuria using Multistix strips\n(Bayer Diagnostics, Puteau, France). Urine samples were graded 0e\n4\u00fe, corresponding to the following approximate protein concen-\ntrations: 0 \u00bc negative or trace, 30 mg/dl, 100 mg/dl, 300 mg/dl and\n\ufffd2000 mg/dl. Mice with a significant proteinuria (\ufffd300) on two\nconsecutive examinations were designated positive for renal dis-\nease. Severely ill and wasted mice with a significant proteinuria\nwere sacrificed when they appeared moribund. These mice were\nconsidered as dead at the time they were killed and were included\nin the survival evaluation.\n\nHistologic analysis of the kidneys: Mice perfused with PBS were\nparaffin embedded. Five micron sections were stained for H&E. For\ndetection of Ig deposits, paraffin sections (4e5 mm) were incubated\nwith ananti-mouse Fc IgG FITC-conjugated (Jackson). Evaluationwas\nperformed by two pathologists that were blinded to the diagnosis.\n\n2.6. Immunoglobulin elution from the kidneys\n\nLysate from the kidneys were prepared following perfusionwith\nPBS. The kidneys were homogenized with Glycine-HCl O.2M pH2.5.\nThe eluate was dialyzed against PBS. Anti-ribos.P binding was\ndetected by ELISA.\n\n2.7. Preparation of primary mouse mesangial cells (MCs)\n\nMCs from C3H/Hen mice kidneys were isolated according to a\nprotocol described by Deocharan B et al. [7]. The outer cortexes of\n\n\n\nD. Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126 121\n10 kidneys were minced with a razor, and the tissue was forced\nthrough progressively smaller stainless steel sieves (180, 150, and\n90 mm, Sigma). Glomeruli were then caught on a 75-mm sieve,\nwashed twice with PBS, and centrifuged for 5 min at 220 g. The\nwashed glomeruli were treatedwith collagenase for 20min at 24 \ufffdC\nand washed again as above. Cells were plated out in RPMI 1640\nsupplemented with non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate,\ninsulin, and 20% FCS, and maintained at 37 \ufffdC/5% CO2. The media\nwas changed every 4 days. After 30 days, the cultures consist of\nvirtually pure MCs.\n\n2.8. MCs Treatments, lysate preparation, immunoblotting and real-\ntime-PCR\n\nMCs derived from C3H mice kidneys, were exposed to human\nanti-Ribos.P Abs, mouse anti-Ribos.P mAbs control human IgG and\ncontrol mouse IgG1 isotype control (20 mg/ml) for 4 h. Subse-\nquently, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5),\n1%SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail, and 0.2 mM PMSF, all the re-\nagents were purchased from Sigma), incubated 30 min at 4 \ufffdC, and\ncentrifuged to remove debris. The protein content of the lysate was\nmeasured using the BCA\ufffd protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific,\nRockford, IL, USA). Phospho-MAPKs membrane arrays (R&D Sys-\ntems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were exposed to the different\nlysates originated from MCs exposed to anti-Ribos.P Abs and the\nrelevant controls, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol [35].\n\nTotal mRNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA isolation kit\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNAwas then reverse\ntranscribed into cDNA by MMLV reverse transcriptase. Five micro-\ngrams of total RNA was transcribed to cDNA in a 30-ml reaction\nvolume. For transcript quantification by real-time PCR, the SYBR\nGreen Mix containing Thermo-Start DNA Polymerase (InVitroGene,\nCA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\ncDNA samples were amplified using specific primers.

Results\n\n3.1. rRibos.P0 NZBxW/F1 immunized mice developed accelerated\nglomerulonephritis\n\nWe studied the potential of de-novo generated mouse anti-\nRibos.P Abs by immunizing NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice with\nrRibos.P0, on the development of glomerulonephritis. We analyzed\nthe titers of autoantibodies, proteinuria, immunoglobulin deposi-\ntion in the glomeruli and we eluted mouse anti-Ribos.P0 from the\nkidneys of the rRibos.P0 immunized mice. NZBxW/F1 lupus prone\nmice, immunized with rRibos.P0, developed an earlier glomerulo-\nnephritis than the adjuvant immunized mice week 18e22 in\ncomparison to the adjuvant injected mice which developed\nglomerulonephritis at week 32e34. These mice developed high\ntiters of anti-Ribos.P Abs which remained steadily high until the\ntimewhen the mice developed glomerulonephritis, at the age of 34\nweeks (Fig. 1a), P < 0.001. The data were confirmed by an immu-\nnoblot (Fig. 1b). Whereas the CFA immunized mice, did not develop\nanti-Ribos.P Abs. However, the titers of anti-dsDNA Abs in the sera\nwere elevated in both, in the rRibos.P0 and the CFA immunized\nmice (Fig. 1c). The titers of anti-dsDNA were not affected by the\nimmunization procedure with rRibos.P, p > 0.05, (Fig. 1c).\n\nAs depicted in Table 1, anti-Ribos.P Abs were not cross reactive\nwith dsDNA since anti-dsDNA affinity purified from the sera of\nNZBxW/F1 mice, did not bind Ribos.P ELISA plate and was not\ninhibited by Ribos.P on dsDNA ELISA plate. Moreover, the datawere\nconfirmed by using anti-Ribos.P mAb derived from these mice. The\nanti-Ribos.P mAb binding to Ribos.P was not inhibited by dsDNA\nand no anti-dsDNA binding was observed (Table 1).Interestingly, a\ncross reactivity between Ribos.P and Sm antigen was detected\n(Table 1).Anti-Sm binding was tested by using polyclonal IgG from\nthe lupus mice which were anti-dsDNA depleted, anti-Ribos.P mAb,\nand Ribos.P as inhibitor.

The data are mean \ufffd SD of 3 experiments.\n\nD. Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126122\nGiven that the titers of circulating anti-Ribos.P were elevated in\nthe rRibos.P0 immunized mice, we assessed the deposition of these\nAbs in the kidneys. Mouse anti-Ribos.P IgGAbs were extracted from\nthe kidneys of rRibos.P0 immunized mice. The immunoglobulin\nextracted from the kidneys of the rRibos.P immunized mice in\ncomparison to the adjuvant immunized mice were analyzed for\nanti-Ribos.P binding by ELISA. The data revealed 1.065 \ufffd 0.112 OD\nat 405 nm for the Ig extracted from rRibos.P immunized mice\nkidneys in comparison to 0.213 \ufffd 0.087 for the Ig extracted from\nthe CFA immunized kidneys. Yet, a direct confirmation for the\nnephritogenic activity of anti-Ribos.P in the development of\nglomerulonephritis was needed. Therefore, we have generated a\nmouse anti-Ribos.P0 mAb from the splenocytes of NZBxW/F1 rRi-\nbos.P0 immunized mouse. The anti-Ribos.P0 mAb recognized a\nsynthetic peptide composed of the carboxy-terminal 22-amino acid\nof the ribosome-P protein (RIBOSPEP) by ELISA. As illustrated in\nFig. 2, the RIBOSPEP inhibited the binding of anti-Ribos.P mAb to\nrRibos.P0 by 98.4 \ufffd 7.1% at the concentration of 10 mg/ml, whereas\nFig. 3.

The\nrRibos.P0 immunized group of mice, showed a higher percentage of\nmice having >100 mg/dl proteinuria (40% at week 20, 60% at week\n24) in comparison with the CFA immunized mice (1% at week 20\nand 59% at week 24).At the age of 18 weeks (3 weeks after boost\nadministration), Ribos.P0 immunized mice already began to\ndevelop proteinuria whereas the control mice did not (Fig. 3a). As\nshown in Fig. 3b, renal histopathology at week 24 of age, revealed\ntypical findings of focal and diffuse proliferative damage in\nglomerulus shown by H&E staining. Immunofluorescence staining\nillustrate immunoglobulin deposits in the glomeruli with diffuse\npattern of diffuse peripheral deposition (Fig. 3b). Whereas, no\nsignificant immunoglobulin deposition in the glomeruli was\nobserved in the kidneys of adjuvant immunized mice or in the non-\nimmunized mice of the same age.\n\n3.2. Na\u00efve mice immunized with rRibos.P0, developed\nglomerulonephritis and experimental lupus\n\nWe immunized C3H/Hen female mice with rRibos.P0 emulsified\nin CFA as an adjuvant. One-month after booster administration, the\nrRibos.P0 immunized mice developed significantly elevated titers\nof circulating anti-Ribos.P0 Abs (p < 0.001), when compared to\ncontrol CFA immunized mice (Fig. 4a). In addition, the mice\ndeveloped high levels of circulating anti-dsDNA Abs which\nremained constant over the time as depicted in Fig. 4b. Elevated\nanti-Sm Abs were shown in the rRibos.P0 injected mice (Fig. 4c). As\nshown in Table 1, anti-Ribos.P Abs were not cross reactive with\ndsDNA since anti-dsDNA affinity purified from the sera of C3H/Hen\nmice, did not bind Ribos.P and were not inhibited by Ribos.P on\ndsDNA ELISA plate. However, a cross reactivity between anti-\nRibos.P and Sm antigen was illustrated (Table 1). Polyclonal IgG\nanti-dsDNA depleted binding to Sm ELISA plates was inhibited by\nRibos.P (46% up to 57% inhibition), p < 0.01. Clinically, all the rRi-\nbos.P0 injected mice exhibited proteinuria at 4 months after the\nbooster administration (e.g 100 mg/dl) whereas the CFA injected\nmice did not develop proteinuria (0e30 mg/dl). Renal histopa-\nthology at 4 months after boost injection revealed a diffuse\n. 3a: Percent of mice with proteinuria above 100 mg/dl.

Furthermore, anti-Ribos.P0 was\neluted from the kidney. Analyses of the immunoglobulins eluted\nfrom the kidneys,showed elevated anti-Ribos.P0 activity by ELISA\n(OD of 0.893 \ufffd 0.078 in comparison to OD of 0.0930 \ufffd 0.03 in the\nlysate of kidneys from the CFA injected mice).\n\nIn addition all the C3H/Hen immunized mice with rRibos.P\ndeveloped alopecia on their face (a well-known skin manifestation\nof lupus), whereas control mice did not (Fig. 5b).\n\n3.3. Anti-Ribos.P activate p38 MAPK in mesangial cells in-vitro\n\nMouse mesangial cell cultures prepared from healthy C3H/Hen\nfemale kidneys. In order to follow the effect of anti-Ribos.P on\nmesangial cells signaling cascade, a lysate from the mesangial cells\nwas introduced to protein MAPKs protein array. The mesangial cell\ncultures were pre-exposed for 24 h to mouse anti-Ribos.P mAb and\nits IgG1 control or to a human anti-Ribos.P IgG and its IgG control.\nAs shown in Fig. 6a, anti-Ribos.P originated either from human\nlupus patient or from a mouse origin, enhanced significantly the\nexpression of phosphorylated p38a P < 0.001 by densitometry and\nHSP27, p < 0.02 in densitometry. Furthermore, as described in\nFig. 6b, the expression of p-p38 was confirmed in the level of mRNA\nby real time PCR, p < 0.004 for human anti-Ribos.P and p < 0.01 for\na mouse anti-rRibos.P in comparison to the relevant control\nimmunoglobulin. The data were confirmed by immunoblot, Fig. 6c.\nThe immunoblot analyses demonstrated that anti-Ribos.P from\nmouse and human origins, as well as anti-dsDNA IgG affinity pu-\nrified from the lupus mice, enhanced the expression of p-p38,\nwhereas anti-anti-Ribos.P inhibited the anti-Ribos.P effect on the\nmesangial cells, which confirm the specificity of the p38 activation\nby anti-Ribos.P Abs.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn the present study we demonstrated that recombinant\nRibos.P0 (38 kD) immunized NZBxW/F1 lupus prone mice, devel-\noped mouse anti-Ribos.P Abs, which did not target dsDNA and\nshare specificity with Sm antigen by 40%. Accelerated proteinuria\nwas detected in the Ribos.P immunized mice associated with renal\nhistopathology at week 24 of age revealed focal and diffuse pro-\nliferative damage in glomeruli with a diffuse peripheral deposition\ndemonstrated by immunofluorescence. Non-significant immuno-\nglobulin deposition was observed in the CFA adjuvant immunized\nmice or non-immunized mice at the same age of 24 weeks. The\ndirect nephritogenic properties of anti-Ribos.P was approved by a)\nrRibos.P immunized mice developed accelerated glomerulone-\nphritis. Mouse anti-Ribos.P Abs were detected in the kidneys from\nthe NZBxW/F1mice .b) Anti-Ribos.P mAb originated from rRibos.P0\nimmunized NZBxW/F1 did not bind dsDNA,share specificity with\nSm antigen. Anti-Ribos.P Abs from mouse and human origin acti-\nvate the phosphorylation of p38a and HSP27 MAPKs. c) C3H/Hen\nna\u00efve mice immunized with rRibos.P0 developed high levels of\ncirculating anti-Ribos.P, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm/RNP Abs. The\nanti-Ribos.P Abs did not bind dsDNA but were cross reactive with\nSm antigen. The profile of circulating autoantibodies was associated\nwith sever glomerulonephritis that was illustrated by proteinuria\nand diffuse proliferative mesangial damage with diffuse peripheral\ndeposition. All C3H/Hen immunized mice with rRibos.P developed\nalopecia. Control mice did not develop either circulating autoanti-\nbodies nor nephritis or alopecia.\n\nThe MAPKs cascade is involved in many pathways of immune\nresponses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell\ndeath. One of the three major groups of MAPKs in mammalian cells\nis the p38 MAPK. It is now well recognized that there are multiple\n\n\n\nFig. 5.

Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126124\nmechanisms of p38 activation. In the classical conserved cascade,\nMAP K 3 (MKK3), MKK4, and MKK6 activates p38 MAPK by a dual\nphosphorylation at the tripeptide motif Thr-Gly-Tyr [43,44]. Toll-\nlike receptors (TLRs) stimulate inflammatory pathways, ending in\nthe activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB and activating protein-1\n(AP-1). p38 MAPK plays essential roles in mediating AP-1 activa-\ntion in TLR signaling [45]. It was suggested that MAPs are involved\nin the development of renal injury and have an important role in\nthe pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. p38 MAPK is being acti-\nvated in normal human kidney and its activation is significantly\nincreased in class III and IV lupus glomerulonephritis and ANCA-\npositive pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. Activation\nof p38 MAPK in renal cells correlates with the degree of interstitial\ninflammation [46]. The expression of vascular cell adhesion\nmolecule-1 (VCAM-1) in human mesangial cells leads to recruit-\nment of leukocytes and monocytes adhesion to the glomerular\nmesangium. This is mediated, at least partially, by activation of p38\nMAPK [47]. Moreover, studies show that p38 MAP K inhibitors have\nfavorable effects by reducing glomerular infiltration and prolifera-\ntion [48,40]. Inhibition of p38 MAPK reduce glomerular macro-\nphage accumulation and crescent formation in vivo, and decrease\nanti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies(ANCA)-activation of\nneutrophils in vitro [49]. The specific deposition and concentration\nof anti-Ribos.P at the site of tissue injury was previously demon-\nstrated by Reichlin\u2019s group, as they discovered a 30-fold enrich-\nment of anti-Ribos.P activity in the renal eluate from a patient with\nlupus nephritis [50]. In our study, human and mouse originated\nanti-Ribos.P activatedmesangial cells in-vitro, resulting in p38a and\nHSP27 phosphorylation. This finding confirms the pathogenic role\nof anti-Ribos.P autoantibodies.\n\nOur data contribute additional target epitope to the muliepitope\nnetwork of lupus related autoantibodies related to the mesangium\nin lupus. There are several autoantibodies which cross react with\ndsDNA such as actinin and annexin-II, which also activate mesan-\ngial cells via p38 [51,52].\n\nSLE has a wide range of clinical manifestations and lupus\nnephritis is a principal cause of death [1]. The currently used\nclassification of lupus nephritis includes 6 histologic classes as\ndiagnosed by kidney biopsy [3]. During exacerbation of lupus\nnephritis there is an increase in titer of anti dsDNA autoantibodies\nand formation of immune complex. Recurrent inflammation cause\neventually mesangial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [4].\n\nThe nephritogenic properties of anti-Ribos.P in the currenet\nstudy goes along with the previously suggested mechanisms\nwhich encompass the following: a) Anti-ribos.P Abs-mediated\ntissue injury. Ribos.P proteins are expressed as intracellular anti-\ngens and also as antigens that are displayed on the cell surfaces of\ndifferent tissues and numerous types of cells, including mesangial\ncells, astrocytes, neuroblastoma cells, hepatoma cells and fibro-\nblasts [32,36,37,39]. For example, anti-Ribos.P target and penetrate\nintracellular Jurkat T cells followed by apoptotic cell-death process\n[38]. Anti-Ribos.P penetrateinot HepG2 hepatocytes in-vitro and\ncause damage apolipoprotein B synthesis, resulting in tripling of\nthe amount of intra-cell cholesterol and lipid droplets (and\nthereby consistent with what is seen in various chronic liver dis-\neases) [32]. b) Anti-ribos.P Abs substantially inhibit the overall\nlevel of protein synthesis in-vitro, (as measured by methionine\nincorporation [35S]) [32,40]. c) Anti-Ribos.P Abs bind a neuronal\nsurface and are capable of inducing in vivo and in vitro apoptosis in\nneurons, following the flow of calcium into cells [41]. d) Anti-\nRibos.P may interfere with Th17 responses as a result of their\nactivation of the p38 MAPK, as it was shown that the p38a acted in\nDCs to regulate IL-6 and IL-27 and to initiate Th17 differentiation\nand autoimmune inflammation [42].\n\n\n\nFig. 6.

Ben-Ami Shor et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 54 (2014) 118e126 125\nFinally, the association of glomerulonephritis and elevated titers\nof anti-Ribos.P Abs in lupus patients was previously reported by\nseveral groups [22,23,27]. Our findings demonstrate for the first\ntime the direct nephritogenic properties of anti-Ribos.P autoanti-\nbodies and their role in the development of glomerulonephritis in\nexperimental model. In lupus As reported by Bonfa et al. Implica-\ntion to human: anti-Ribos.P can be considered as a biomarker for\nlupus nephritis in the sera.\nConflict of interest\n\nWe certify that there is no conflict of interest with any financial\norganization regarding the material discussed in the manuscript.\nReferences\n\n[1] Berden JH, Licht R, van Bruggen MC, Tax WJ.

F\na b s t r a c t\n\nInflammatory responses of THP-1 cells (macrophage cell line) exposed to chrysotile asbestos (Chry) and\nLibby six-mix (LIB) and the subsequent impact on bronchial epithelial cells were determined. Direct\ntreatment of THP-1 cells with Chry caused cell death, activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1b, while\nthe addition of caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK, reduced IL-1b, suggesting that Chry activated the cas-\npase-1 mediated Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome; by comparison, LIB had less effects\non all of these parameters. Expression of antioxidant enzymes, protein oxidation and nitration, and lipid\nperoxides in THP-1 cells treated with the two particles suggest that LIB generated more reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) than the same dose of Chry. Differences in fiber length and surface area suggest a possible\nrole for particulate size in the differential activation of the inflammasome. BEAS-2B cells, representing the\nbronchial epithelium, treated with supernatants of medium from Chry- or LIB-treated THP-1 cells (con-\nditioned medium) activated the MAPK cascade, increased phosphorylation of ERK and Cot (MAP3K8),\nincreased AP-1 binding activity and induced IL-6 release. To verify that IL-1b from THP-1 cells was\nresponsible for activation of BEAS-2B, conditioned medium with added IL-1Ra, an IL-1b antagonist,\nwas applied to BEAS-2B. Results show that IL-1Ra attenuated effects of conditioned medium, supporting\na role of IL-1b, as a secondary mediator, in the transduction of inflammatory signaling from the macro-\nphage to epithelial cells. The effects of LIB-conditioned medium appeared to be less dependent on IL-1b.\nIn conclusion, Chry and LIB induce differential inflammatory responses in THP-1 cells that subsequently\nlead to differential effects in epithelial cells.\n\n\ufffd 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Inflammation plays a key role in lung injury, involving\ndifferent cell types, such as alveolar macrophages and bronchial\nepithelial cells that initiate and/or sustain inflammatory processes.\nAlveolar macrophages provide surveillance of the major bound-\naries between the body and the outside world. Macrophages are in-\nnate immune cells with well-established roles in the primary\nresponse to pathogens. These cells recognize danger signals\nthrough receptors and activate specific signaling pathways [2].\nThe macrophage-like cell line, THP-1, has been shown to secrete\nthe proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b, upon contact with crocidolite\nasbestos [3\u20135]. Mature IL-1b is processed through cleavage of the\ninactive pro-IL-1b precursor by caspase-1/ICE (IL-1b converting en-\nzyme). Caspase-1 was the first caspase to be discovered in mam-\nmals, but only recently has the pathway leading to its activation\nbeen elucidated and shown to involve a series of large complexes,\ncalled inflammasomes [6,7]. Stimulation of macrophages with\nasbestos resulted in cell death and robust secretion of IL-1b in a\nmanner dependent on the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3),\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.025\nmailto:Naomi.Fukagawa@uvm.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.08.025\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\nM. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 719\nalso called Nalp3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing pro-\ntein 3) inflammasome [3,4,8,9]. Previous reports have indicated\nthat macrophages from wild-type mice could undergo caspase-1-\nmediated IL-1b maturation but macrophages deficient in the\nNLRP3 inflammasome were incapable of secreting IL-1b [3,4,8].\n\nFollowing the initiation of proinflammatory responses upon\nexposure to asbestos with the release of cytokines, such as IL-1b,\nalveolar macrophages often die and are cleared from the airway.\nIn contrast, neighboring bronchial epithelial cells can sustain path-\nogenic responses and lead to asbestos-related lung disease, even if\nthey may not be in direct contact with the asbestos fibers. IL-6 is\nconsidered to be an important mediator of acute inflammation\n[10] and implicated in the pathogenesis of particle-related lung\ndisease. The MAPK pathways contribute to epithelial cell prolifera-\ntion, which is a major risk factor for the development of lung can-\ncer or fibro-proliferative diseases [11,12]. Whether IL-1b secreted\nby THP-1 cells affects the alveolar epithelium leading to cell prolif-\neration, inflammation and eventual fibrosis via MAPK-IL-6 path-\nways is uncertain although it is well established that direct\nexposure of pulmonary epithelial cells [13], alveolar [14], and\nbronchial epithelial cells [15,16] to asbestos leads to activation of\nMAPK cascades and induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.\n\nSeveral investigators have examined the interaction between\nmacrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, employing a co-culture\nsystem (Transwell) in which two different cell types were sepa-\nrated by a membrane with only macrophages exposed to the par-\nticles of asbestos or silica [17\u201319]. In the other compartment, the\nepithelial cells were bathed by the same culture medium. Although\ninteresting connections were suggested, the underlying mecha-\nnisms whereby primary responses of the macrophage initiated\nand interacted with lung epithelial cells remain unclear. We have\ninvestigated signal transduction from THP-1 macrophage-like cells\nto BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells through a relatively simple\nmethod: that is, to initially determine the inflammatory responses\nof THP-1 exposed to different particulate fibers followed by collec-\ntion of the supernatants of culture medium without any fibers\n(termed as conditioned medium) in which BEAS-2B cells were then\ngrown and their responses assessed.\n\nAsbestos occurs naturally and is composed of long thin fibers\nbroadly classified into two groups: serpentine and amphibole\n[20]. Chrysotile asbestos (the asbestiform variety of the serpentine\ngroup) is the most commonly used asbestos type in the US [21]. The\namphibole asbestos group consists of five mineral species: amosite,\ncrocidolite, tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite. The amphibole\nasbestos occurring in the vermiculite mine near Libby, Montana, is\na mixture of several different species of amphiboles [22]. Several\nresearch groups have studied this material, but the samples used\nin the present work are a subset of those discussed in the publica-\ntion by Meeker et al. [23] and morphologically characterized by\nBellamy and Gunter [24]. Bellamy and Gunter referred to the Libby\nmaterial as \u2018\u2018six-mix\u2019\u2019. Because many of the studies examining the\npathogenic mechanisms related to aberrant cellular responses to\nasbestos exposure utilized different forms of asbestos, the present\nwork contrasts the signal transduction pathways induced by chrys-\notile asbestos (Chry) and Libby six-mix (LIB). The role of IL-1b in the\nTHP-1-conditioned medium secreted in response to Chry or LIB\nwas compared and its subsequent effects on BEAS-2B immune re-\nsponses, specifically IL-6 secretion, were examined.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell culture\n\nTHP-1 cells: THP-1 cells from a human monocyte cell line were\ngrown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS;\n100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin; 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM So-\ndium pyruvate at 37.0 \ufffdC in 5% CO2. Cells from this monocytic cell\nline require differentiation into cells with the functional character-\nistics of mature macrophages [25,26], accomplished by treatment\nwith 100 nM PMA overnight and then refreshing the cells with\nmedium without PMA. BEAS-2B cells: BEAS-2B cells from the hu-\nman bronchial epithelial cell line (ATCC) were seeded into flasks\nor plates pre-coated with a mixture of 0.01 mg/ml fibronectin,\n0.03 mg/ml bovine collagen type I and 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum\nalbumin in medium. The cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium\n(Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS; 100 U/ml of Penicillin/Streptomy-\ncin, 1 lg/ml Insulin-Transferrin-Na selenite (Sigma), 1 lg/ml\nHydrocortisone (Sigma), and 10 mM HEPES at 37.0 \ufffdC in 5% CO2.\n\n2.2. Chrysotile asbestos and Libby six-mix treatments\n\nChrysotile asbestos fibers (National Institute of Environmental\nHealth Sciences reference sample, NIEHS), and Libby six-mix (Uni-\nted States Geological Service, USGS) have been physically and\nchemically characterized previously [21,24,27\u201330]. Glass beads\n(GB) from Polysciences Inc. were used as a noncytotoxic particle\ncontrol [29]. The surface area of chrysotile measured using\nMicromeritics Tristar equipment for nitrogen gas sorption analysis\nby Happond Expander\u2122 is reported to be 28.83 m2/g (Table 1). The\nChry and LIB fibers were sterilized under ultraviolet light overnight\nprior to suspension in HBSS at 1 mg/ml, sonication for 15 min in a\nwater bath sonicator, and trituration eight times through a 22-\ngauge needle before treatment of the cells [31]. Two mass-based\nconcentration systems have been commonly used in studies of\nasbestos exposure: (1) mass concentration, which means the mass\nof a constituent divided by the volume of a carrier and (2) mass-\nper-area, which is the mass divided by the exposed surface area.\nThe asbestos suspensions were directly added to differentiated\nmacrophages or BEAS-2B cells in medium at a mass concentration\nof 20 lg/ml and 40 lg/ml for 24 h, which was equivalent to mass\nper area of 5 lg/cm2 and 10 lg/cm2 achieved by adjusting the vol-\nume of medium based on the surface area of the culture dishes. The\nculture medium collected after exposure of THP-1 cells for 24 h\nwas centrifuged at the highest speed of an Eppendorf 5430R centri-\nfuge with 50 ml-tube rotor. Then the supernatant of medium was\nused to treat BEAS-2B cells and referred to as conditioned medium\nwith indicated asbestos concentration from the original THP-1\ntreatment. Since the conditioned medium contained no particles\nand the cellular responses to GB or medium alone were similar, a\nGB control was not included in the experiments using conditioned\nmedium.\n\n2.3. Caspase-1 inhibitor treatments\n\nA caspase-1 inhibitor VI, Z-YVAD-FMK (ZYF), was purchased\nfrom BioVison and a caspase-1 inhibitor V, Z-D-CH2-DCB (ZD),\nfrom Calbiochem. In preliminary experiments, 10, 20, 40 and\n50 lM of inhibitors were applied to THP-1 cell 30 min prior to\nasbestos treatment. After 24 h, the inhibitory effects on production\nof IL-1b were compared, suggesting that ZYF was more efficient\nthan ZD. Based on these preliminary results, only 40 lM of ZYF\nwas used in the subsequent experiments.\n\n2.4. IL-1b and IL-1Ra treatments\n\nRecombinant human IL-1b protein and the antibody for cleaved\nIL-1b were purchased from Cell Signaling. The IL-1 receptor antag-\nonist (IL-1Ra) was purchased from Abcam. BEAS-2B cells were\nchallenged in preliminary experiments by 10, 20, 40, 80, and\n100 ng/ml recombinant IL-1b to determine its effect on the secre-\ntion of IL-6. The inhibitory effects of both IL-1Ra and anti-IL-1b\n\n\n\nTable 1\nFiber size references.\n\nFiber name Mean fiber\nlength (lm)\n\nMean\nSA (m2/g)\n\nSource\n\nGlass beads (GB)a 2.06 3 Polysciences Inc\nChrysotile (Chry) 21b 28.83c NIEHS\nLIBBY-6-mix (LIB)d 7.21 5 USGS\n\na [29].\nb [30].\nc Nitrogen gas sorption analysis by Hammond Expanders\u2122.\nd [29].\n\n720 M. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730\nwere also tested and compared. Based on the preliminary results,\nonly 400 ng/ml of IL-1Ra was used in the subsequent experiments\nto treat BEAS-2B cells.\n\n2.5. CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay viability protocol\n\nThe CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay (Promega) uses a luminogenic peptide\nsubstrate (alanyl-alanylphenylalanyl-aminoluciferin; AAF-Glo\u2122\nSubstrate) to measure dead-cell protease activity, which is released\nfrom cells after loss of membrane integrity. The assay is primarily\ndesigned to selectively detect dead cells; however, with the addi-\ntion of the lysis reagent (provided in the kit), the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 As-\nsay viability protocol (by lysis) can also deliver the luminescent\nsignal associated with the total number of cells. Cells were grown\nand treated as described above and then trypsinized and passed\nthrough the 40 lm mesh to break the clusters of cells and asbestos\nfibers. The collected cells were then loaded into a 96-well plate and\nthe CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay reagents applied to wells sequentially fol-\nlowing the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The luminescent signals were\nmeasured in a Synergy HT4 multi-detection microplate reader\n(BioTek Instruments). Viability was calculated by subtracting the\nluminescent signal resulting from experimental cell death from to-\ntal luminescent values.\n\n2.6. LDH cytotoxicity assay\n\nThe CytoTox 96\ufffd cytotoxicity assay is a colorimetric assay from\nPromega. The assay quantitatively measures lactate dehydroge-\nnase (LDH), a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell ly-\nsis by treatments. Released LDH in culture supernatants was\nmeasured after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h treatments with an enzymatic\nassay, which results in the conversion of a tetrazolium salt (INT)\ninto a red formazan product. The amount of color formed is propor-\ntional to the number of lysed cells. Visible wavelength absorbance\ndata were collected at 490 nm with the Synergy HT4 (BioTek\nInstruments). The results are expressed as a percentage of maxi-\nmum LDH released from cells lysed by repeated freezing and\nthawing.\n\n2.7. Cytokine assays\n\nCells were grown and treated as described above; the culture\nmedium was then collected and centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm\nin an Eppendorf 5430R centrifuge with a rotor for 1.5 ml-tubes,\nand the supernatants stored in \ufffd80 \ufffdC until analysis. Cytokines\nand chemokines were analyzed using both Bio-Plex Pro\u2122 Assay\n(Bio-Rad) and Milliplex Map\ufffd Assay (Millipore). Bio-Plex-27 hu-\nman cytokine kits were used in screening of cytokine responses,\nwhile Milliplex Map\ufffd custom kits were used for selected cytokines.\nThe samples were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions and run on the Bio-Plex suspension array system\n(Bio-Rad). Standard curves were calculated and samples were ana-\nlyzed using the Bio-Plex Manager software version 5 (Bio-Rad).\n2.8. Caspase-1 FLICA assay\n\nZ-YVAD-FMK caspase-1 FLICA kit was purchased from Immuno-\nchemistry Technologies, LLC. The methodology is based on a fluo-\nrochrome inhibitor of caspase-1, the FLICA reagent FAM-YVAD-\nFMK, which enters the cells and binds covalently only to the active\ncaspase-1. The asbestos-treated THP-1 cells were trypsinized and\npassed through the 40 lm mesh. 300 ll of each cell suspension,\nwhich contained at least 1 \ufffd 106 cells, were transferred to sterile\ntubes and incubated or washed sequentially with FLICA reagents\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The aliquots of cells were\nthen loaded into microtiter plate wells in different dilutions and\nfluorescence read on a Synergy HT4 with excitation range from\n488 to 492 nm, and emission range from 515 to 535 nm.\n2.9. Western-blot analysis\n\nThe antibodies for total or phospho-ERK1/2, caspase-1, total or\nphospho-NF-jB p65 (S536) were purchased from Cell Signaling;\nthe antibody for total Cot from Santa Cruz; the antibodies for phos-\npho-Cot (T290), b-actin and a-tubulin from Abcam Inc.; the anti-\nbodies for MnSOD, GCLC from Abnova; the antibody for NLRP3\nfrom AdipoGen; the antibody for 3-nitrotyrosine from Millipore.\nTotal or nuclear proteins were extracted from treated cells as de-\nscribed previously [32]. The 20 lg of each total protein was elec-\ntrophoresed on 10% or 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN\ufffd TGX\u2122 precast gels\n(Bio-Rad) and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.\nAfter blocking the membranes with 1% BSA blocking/dilution buf-\nfer, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary\nantibody at the recommended concentration overnight with shak-\ning at 4 \ufffdC and then rinsed. After incubation with corresponding\nsecondary antibodies, the protein bands were visualized using a\nSuperSignal\u2122 West Pico Trial Kit (PIERCE) and exposed to radio-\ngraphic films. The images and densities were captured with a GS-\n700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and analyzed\nwith Quantity One Software Version 4.2 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).\nThe membranes were stripped and then reimmunoblotted with\nanother antibody or loading control: b-actin or a-tubulin antibody.\n2.10. Oxidized protein detection\n\nProtein carbonyl modifications were detected and quantified\nusing the OxyBLOT\u2122 Assay (Millipore) according the manufac-\nturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, BEAS-2B cells were treated with Chry\nand LIB and protein lysates were incubated with 2, 4-dinitrophen-\nylhydrazine (DNPH). The DNP-derivative protein samples were\nseparated by SDS\u2013PAGE followed by Western blotting. The same\nmembranes were stripped and then reimmunoblotted with b-actin\nas a loading control.\n2.11. Lipid and aqueous peroxides assay\n\nLipid and aqueous peroxides in THP-1 conditioned medium\nwere measured with the OxiSelect\u2122 Hydrogen Peroxide Assay\nKit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nPeroxide in the medium converts Fe2+ into Fe3+, which reacts with\nan equal molar amount in the presence of acid to create a purple\nproduct that absorbs maximally between 540 and 600 nm. Sam-\nples were then reacted with xylenol orange in 96-well plate and\nread on the Synergy HT4. The peroxide content in unknown sam-\nples was calculated by comparison with the predetermined H2O2\nstandard curve.\n\n\n\nM. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 721\n2.12. EMSA for AP-1\n\nDouble stranded AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides were pur-\nchased from Promega. The probes were labeled with [c-32P] ATP\nusing T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) according to the man-\nufacturer\u2019s protocol. EMSA was performed as described previously\n[33]. The 6 lg of nuclear extracts from BEAS-2B cells exposed to\nChry, LIB or 10 ng/ml of TNF-a were used in the binding assay;\n1 ll of anti c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz) were applied to supershift\nthe AP-1 complexes, respectively; cold AP-1 probes were also in-\ncluded at 1:100 M ratios for probe competition.\n\n2.13. Statistics\n\nValues are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM for indicated numbers of\nexperiments, or mean \u00b1 SD for measurement with replicates. The\nmean values are reported as a percentage of control. Comparisons\nwere performed using one way Anova (GraphPad). The p values\nwere considered to be significant if they were 60.05.\nFig. 1. Cell viability and cytotoxicity. THP-1 cells differentiated with 100 nM PMA\nwere refreshed and exposed to 20 lg/ml or 40 lg/ml of chrysotile (Chry20, Chry40)\nand LIB (Lib20, Lib40), and 40 lg/ml glass beads (GB). (A) Cell viability was\nmeasured using the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 viability protocol in duplicate after 24 h\ntreatments. The results were calculated by subtracting the luminescent signal\nresulting from experimental cell death based on total luminescent values. (B) BEAS-\n2B cells were treated with Chry20, Chry40, Lib20, Lib40 and GB. Cell viability was\nmeasured after 24 h treatments using the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 viability protocol in\nduplicate.

Results\n\n3.1. Cell viability in response to asbestos exposure\n\nCell viabilities were assessed with the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay and\nresults shown in Fig. 1A and B. Differences between the two cell\nlines were found in the responses to direct exposure of THP-1\nand BEAS-2B cells to 20 or 40 lg/ml of Chry (Chry20, Chry40)\nand LIB (Lib20, Lib40). After 24 h of exposure, Chry significantly re-\nduced the survival of THP-I cells compared to control, whereas LIB\nhad less of an effect (Fig. 1A). No reduction of cell viability was\nseen in BEAS-2B cells with the treatments compared to control;\nhowever, cell number based on the CytoTox-Glo\u2122 Assay slightly\nincreased with LIB treatments (Fig. 1B). To confirm the result from\nFig. 1A, a LDH cytotoxicity assay was used in THP cells treated with\nChry and LIB for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h (Fig. 1C). Cell death gradually\nincreased with increasing exposure times. By 24 h, Chry40 had in-\nduced significant cell death (\ufffd60%), with lesser degrees induced by\nChry20, LIB40 and LIB20. Together the data indicate selective cyto-\ntoxicity in macrophages exposed to asbestos compared to epithe-\nlial cells.\n\n3.2. IL-1b and caspase-1 responses in THP-1 cells\n\nCytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured in the\nsupernatant of the culture medium from treated THP-1 cells using\nthe human Bio-Plex array (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for\ncomplete set of data). IL-1b was the most prominently induced\ncytokine. Fig. 2A shows the results of induction of IL-1b in 3 inde-\npendent experiments when THP-1 cells were treated with Chry\nand LIB for 24 h. Chry20 induced a 4-fold and Chry40 a 6-fold in-\ncrease in IL-1b secretion compared to the control; whereas Lib40\ninduced IL-1b secretion by only 2.9-fold. Meanwhile GB and con-\ntrol resulted in similar levels of IL-1b. Other cytokines found to\nbe significantly induced included IL-1Ra, G-CSF and IL-2 (see Sup-\nplementary Table 2).\n\nThe combination of cell death and IL-1b secretion suggested the\npossible involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3\nexpression was hence determined by Western-blot and showed\nthat NLRP3 protein level was higher in all treatments compared\nto control. However, none of treatments achieved statistical signif-\nicance compared to control (Fig. 2B).\n\nPro-caspase-1, an assembling member of the inflammasome\ncomplex, is proteolytically activated from a proenzyme to produce\ntwo active subunits, p20 and p10, with p20 being identifiable by\nimmuno-blotting. Fig. 3A shows a representative blot and a sum-\nmary of data obtained from three independent experiments. Re-\nsults suggest that active p20 was induced by the Chry\ntreatments, especially Chry40, but to a lesser degree by LIB treat-\nments with no effect by GB. To further confirm the activation of\ncaspase-1 in Chry-treatments, the caspase-1 FLICA assay was per-\nformed and the result revealed that Chry40 clearly increased cas-\npase-1 activity in the THP-1 cells (Fig. 3B).\n\nThe activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1b are two\nimportant consequences of inflammasome activation. To verify\nwhether blocking caspase-1 activation would reduce maturation\nof IL-1b in macrophages, a caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK\n(ZYF) was used in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and treated with\n40 lg/ml asbestos. Application of ZYF showed a trend towards\n\n\n\nFig. 2. IL_1b release and NLRP3 priming. (A) Release of IL-1b in THP-1 cells was analyzed with a Bio-Plex 27 cytokine array.

Results from three independent experiments were summarized as mean \u00b1 SE in\nthe bar-graphs. \ufffd Indicates p 6 0.05 when comparing asbestos treatments with control.

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730\nrepression of active p20, although the inhibitory effect did not\nreach statistical significance (Fig. 3A). Meanwhile, Fig. 3C shows\nthat IL-1b was significantly induced by Chry20 and Chry40 with\nless effect of Lib40 and no effect of GB. ZYF significantly repressed\nthe Chry40 and Lib40 effects resulting in little IL-1b detectable in\nthe medium. These results suggest that IL-1b secretion in response\nto asbestos is caspase-1 dependent.\n\n3.3. Comparison of ROS production in Chry and LIB treated THP-1 cells\n\nOxidative stress is another potential mediator for particle-in-\nduced inflammation in cells. Two antioxidant related enzymes,\nFig. 3. Activation of caspase-1.

Chry treated THP-1 macrophages were analy\nwhen comparing Chry treatments with control. (C) The effects of ZYF on release of IL-1b b\n30 min prior to exposure to Chry and LIB. IL-1b levels in media analyzed with Milliplex Pl\nChry or LIB treatments with control; \ufffd indicates p 6 0.05 when comparing ZYF-treated v\nsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and c-glutamate cysteine ligase cata-\nlytic subunit (GCLC), were selected as the indicators of oxidative\nstatus since SOD expression is often low in the presence of oxida-\ntive stress whereas GCLC expression is induced if cells are chal-\nlenged by a reduction in GSH levels. Blake et al. have reported in\nmurine macrophages that internalization of LIB asbestos fibers\ngenerated a significant increase in intracellular ROS, decreased\nGSH levels, and impaired total SOD activity [34]. To clarify the oxi-\ndative stress status in Chry- and LIB- treated THP-1 cells, the\nexpression of manganese SOD (MnSOD) and GCLC were compared\nby Western blots. The upper panel of Fig. 4A shows protein blots of\nthe two enzymes in THP-1 cells treated with either Chry or LIB; the\ning both active p20 subunits and other caspase-1 protein components in Chry- and\ntor, ZYF. b-actin in the same blot served as a loading control.

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 723\nlower bar-graphs summarizes MnSOD and GCLC expression in\nthree experiments. Induction of MnSOD was found in response to\nChry but not seen in GB and LIB-treated cells. Meanwhile, an in-\ncrease of GCLC was seen in LIB treated cells but there was little\nin GB and Chry-treated cells. The difference between the responses\nto Chry and LIB treatments suggests that the two particulates in-\nduced oxidative stress to different degrees. Protein carbonyl mod-\nifications were then determined using the OxyBLOT\u2122 Assay. A\nrepresentative blot (Fig. 4B) shows that THP-1 cells treated with\nLib40 displayed a dramatic increase in the number and degree of\noxidized proteins as compared to control, GB and Chry40-treated\ncells. This suggests that more oxidative stress is generated by LIB\namphiboles compared to Chry. Reactive nitrogen species is another\nindicator of oxidative stress. Protein tyrosine nitration in Chry- and\nLIB- treated THP-1 cells was also compared and shown in a repre-\nsentative blot in Fig. 4C. LIB induced more 3-nitrotyrosine forma-\ntion than Chry treatments. Finally, the existence of lipid\nperoxides in conditioned medium was evaluated with the OxiSe-\nlect\u2122 Hydrogen Peroxide Assay as shown in Fig. 4D. LIB treatments\nresulted in more lipid peroxide in conditioned medium than Chry\ntreatments with most of the peroxide found in the lipid rather than\naqueous fraction. There was a significant difference between the\nresponses to Lib20 compared to Chry20.\n\n3.4. Role of IL-1b in BEAS-2B responses to THP-1-conditioned medium\n\nBEAS-2B cells were directly treated with Chry and LIB for 24 h.\nThe induction of IL-6 by direct exposure of epithelial cells to Chry\nhas been described elsewhere [17,35]; therefore in the present\nwork, Chry-40 was used as a \u2018\u2018positive control\u2019\u2019. IL-6 was found\nto be significantly induced by Chry40 and less so by Lib40 in di-\nrectly treated BEAS-2B cells, as shown in Fig. 5A.\n\nBEAS-2B cells were then grown in THP-1 conditioned medium\nfor 24 h as well. Because the IL-1b levels in GB-conditioned med-\nium was consistent with control, as described in Section 3.2, GB-\nconditioned medium was not used in the conditionally treated\nBEAS-2B cells. Several cytokines were found to be induced by con-\nditioned medium (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The most\nsignificant change occurred in IL-6 levels as shown in Fig. 5B. In\ncomparison to Fig. 5A, direct treatment with Chry40 induced a\n4.8-fold increase of IL-6 compared to control; whereas the increase\nin IL-6 by Chry40-conditioned medium was only 1.5-fold. The in-\ncrease in IL-6 by LIB-conditioned medium was less than seen with\nChry-conditioned medium. These data support the contention that\ninduction of IL-6 by THP-1 conditioned medium may be related to\nIL-1b.\n\nActivation of the MAPK cascade is a prominent finding in epi-\nthelial cells directly treated with asbestos [16,36]. Recently, an-\nother inflammatory protein kinase, Cot (cancer osaka thyroid\noncogene), which is also known as Tpl2 (tumor progression locus\n2) or MAP3K8 and functions upstream of MAPK signaling has been\ndescribed [37]. BEAS-2B cells directly treated with Chry and LIB\nparticles showed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and phos-\nphorylation of Cot kinase at Tyr290 compared to control (see Sup-\nplementary Fig. 1A and B). To determine whether conditioned\nmedium had the same stimulatory function as directly treated\nBEAS-2B cells, activation of ERK and Cot was examined in BEAS-\n2B cells treated with THP-1 conditioned medium. Fig. 6A shows\ninduction of P-ERK and P-Cot by Chry- and LIB-conditioned med-\nium, similar to effects seen in directly treated cells.\n\nSince the transcription factor NF-jB has also been suggested to\nplay a key role in the regulation of IL-6 expression and IL-1b is\nknown to specifically induce phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 at\nSer536 [38], the phosphorylation status of NF-jB p65 at Ser536\nwas also examined in conditionally treated BEAS-2B cells. The re-\nsults revealed that phosphorylation of NF-jB p65 at Ser536 was in-\nduced by Chry40-conditioned medium (Fig. 6B). Activation of AP-1,\nwhich is downstream of MAPK pathways, is another important fea-\nture of asbestos-treated epithelial cells. Thus, the binding activity\nof AP-1 was compared by EMSA, as shown in Fig. 6C, and demon-\nstrated that the binding activity of AP-1 was augmented by both\nChry40 and Lib20 conditioned medium.\n\nTo determine if IL-1b itself could activate BEAS-2B cells to se-\ncrete IL-6 as it appears to have done with conditioned medium,\nwe treated cells with recombinant human IL-1b protein. IL-1Ra,\nan antagonist protein of IL-1b, was also used in parallel to test its\neffect on inhibition of IL-1b. Fig. 7A summarizes the IL-1b effect\non IL-6 secretion. Treatment of BEAS-2B with 10 ng/ml of IL-1b in-\nduced \ufffd1.6-fold increase in IL-6 secretion compared to control, but\nincreasing the dose beyond 10 ng/ml did not show a dose-depen-\ndent increase of IL-6 (data not shown). The effect of 100 ng/ml of\nIL-1b on IL-6 was even lower than the effect of 10 ng/ml. This find-\ning is consistent with an effective dose in pharmacology (ED50)\nwhere the ED50 of recombinant IL-1b is commonly reported to\nbe much less than 10 ng/ml. The IL-1Ra molecule is structurally re-\nlated to IL-1b but has mutations rendering it incapable of forming a\ncomplex with IL-1b/IL-1RI/IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-\n1RAcP) [39]. IL-1Ra-treatment did successfully suppress IL-6\nsecretion.\n\nAlthough BEAS-2B cells treated with conditioned medium did\nnot have direct contact with asbestos fibers, both direct and condi-\ntioned medium treatments resulted in phosphorylation of MAPK\nand secretion of IL-6. In addition, IL-1b itself can stimulate BEAS-\n2B in the same manner. The component in the conditioned med-\nium that mediated the inflammatory message from THP-1 cells\nto BEAS-2B cells is likely to be IL-1b. The specificity of the IL-1b ef-\nfect in conditioned medium was hence tested by IL-1Ra to see\nwhether IL-1Ra competitively blocked IL-1b in the conditioned\nmedium and consequently affected the cellular responses of\nBEAS-2B cells. BEAS-2B cells were treated with THP-1-conditioned\nmedium, in addition to Chry40 and Lib40 with or without 40 lM of\nZYF (Chry40, Chry40 + ZYF, Lib40, Lib40 + ZYF) for 24 h. 400 ng/ml\nof IL-1Ra inhibitor was added to another set of Chry40- or Lib40-\nconditioned media (Chry40 + IL-1Ra, Lib40 + IL-1Ra). Fig. 7B illus-\ntrates the corresponding changes in IL-6 by the Milli-Plex 2 Assay\ndone in triplicate. Conditioned medium of Chry40 + ZYF slightly\ndecreased IL-6; however, addition of IL-1Ra to Chry40-conditioned\nmedium had a much greater effect on the suppression of IL-6 re-\nlease. In contrast, LIB treatments showed the same trends, but\nnone of the differences reached significance. Fig. 7C shows a repre-\nsentative of Western-blots on the top and two summary graphs be-\nlow. Results in Fig. 7C indicates the same trend of the inhibitory\neffects of IL-1Ra on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Cot by\nChry40-conditioned medium.\n\nIn summary, both IL-6 and MAPK results demonstrate that\nblocking of IL-1b leads to down-regulation of the effects of\nChry40-conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. This suggests that IL-\n1b in Chry-conditioned medium is responsible for triggering\ninflammatory responses in BEAS-2B cells. In contrast, blocking of\nIL-1b appears to play a smaller role in the effects induced by LIB.\n\n3.5. Comparison of cytotoxicity and inflammatory effects based on\nmatched surface area\n\nWe have compared the effects of Chry and LIB using mass con-\ncentrations of 20 and 40 lg/ml that is equivalent to mass-per-area\nof 5 and 10 lg/cm2. To further evaluate whether the total surface\narea (SA) of particles affected the respective responses, the other\napproach which measures \u2018\u2018the total surface area per unit of\ncross-sectional area\u2019\u2019 was also examined.

These data suggest that Chry had a much\ngreater effect on IL-1b and IL-6 secretion than LIB, which was inde-\npendent of matched total surface area.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. IL-1b acts as a secondary mediator\n\nThe present data elucidate the role of IL-1b in the primary re-\nsponses of the macrophage and its interaction with epithelial cells\nas follows: (1) when exposed to Chry and LIB, THP-1 cells under-\nwent a caspase-1 mediated inflammasome activation that resulted\nin an inflammatory form of cell death which now known as pyrop-\ntosis [40] and produced the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b; (2)\nexogenous IL-1b treatment activated BEAS-2B and triggered\nBEAS-2B inflammatory responses; (3) THP-1 conditioned medium,\ncontaining secreted IL-1b, mimicked the effect of IL-1b treatment;\nand (4) blocking IL-1b by IL-1Ra antagonist protein diminished the\neffects of conditioned medium on BEAS-2B. Together, it appears\nthat the IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium acts as the secondary\nmediator that stimulates the BEAS-2B immune response to Chry\nand LIB.\n\nHowever, activation of target cells by IL-1b is tightly regulated\nat many levels, both extracellularly and intracellularly [39,41].\nThe extracellular regulation includes the presence of naturally\noccurring inhibitors, such as the receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. In\naddition to the release of IL-1b, THP-1 cells also released IL-1Ra\nsimultaneously, as shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Thus,\nthe effect of endogenous IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium\nwas naturally restricted when it was applied to BEAS-2B cells. All\nof these inhibitory effects could explain why a dramatic 10-fold\nhigher level of IL-1b in THP-1 conditioned medium treated with\nChry40 was limited to only 1.5-fold greater release of IL-6 by\nBEAS-2B cells.\n\n4.2. Chry and LIB differentially activate the inflammasome in THP-1\ncells\n\nIn the present work, through comparison of THP-1 cells re-\nsponses to Chry with LIB, we demonstrated that chrysotile asbestos\nhas more effect on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome than\nLIB. Although Fig. 2B did not show that the NLRP3 expression in\nChry treatments is higher than in LIB, activation of caspase-1 and\nrelease of IL-1b were greater in Chry than LIB treatments. NLRP3\ninflammasome activation has been defined as a rapid process in\nwhich caspase-1 cleavage is induced. The process is independent\nof upstream de novo transcription [42]. Cell priming through mul-\ntiple signaling receptors that induce NLRP3 expression is necessary\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Comparison of cell viability and pro-inflammatory cytokines with two matched SA/area concentrations (25 and 150 lm2/cm2).

Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 727\nbut not sufficient for NLRP3 activation [43]. This priming can be\novercome solely by constitutive NLRP3 expression. Actually, mac-\nrophages appear to express high levels of NLRP3 constitutively\nand can bypass the requirement of NLRP3 expression [44,45].\nTherefore, it is the activation of caspase-1, rather than expression\nof NLRP3, that is a key indicator of activation of NLRP3 inflamma-\nsome in THP-1 cells.\n\nEnvironmental toxicants (such as asbestos) and damage-associ-\nated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate the NLRP3 inflamma-\nsome, but the mechanisms by which these structurally distinct\nmolecules trigger NLRP3 oligomerization and inflammasome acti-\nvation are currently unclear and have been intensely debated in\nthe literature [46]. A model in which the generation of ROS is\none of the crucial elements for NLRP3 activation has been sug-\ngested [47]. However, recent studies in mice and humans defective\nin the generation of ROS failed to support this hypothesis and\nstrongly suggested anti-inflammatory effects of ROS [48,49]. Fur-\nthermore, SOD was reported to be required for the activation of\ncaspase-1; SOD1 deficiency led to more ROS in macrophages but\ncaused caspase-1 inhibition by specific oxidation and glutathiony-\nlation [50].\n\nIn this study, Chry did not generate more intracellular ROS than\nLIB (Fig. 4), which was associated with more protein oxidation and\ntyrosine nitration. In addition, Chry promoted production of\nMnSOD protein but LIB did not. It seems unlikely that ROS were\ndriving activation of the inflammasome in Chry treated THP-1 cells.\n\nHowever, an alternative model of inflammasome activation that\ntakes into account the size of the activators is the lysosome rupture\nmodel, which is particularly useful in explaining NLRP3 inflamma-\nsome activation by large particulate activators, such as Chry.\nAccording to this model, when phagocytosed particulates are too\nlarge to be efficiently cleared, inefficient clearance of the activating\nparticle following phagocytosis leads to phagosomal destabiliza-\ntion and lysosomal rupture [47]. Lysosomal damage results in the\nrelease of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol that mediates\nNLRP3 inflammasome activation [51,52]. Since the selected model\nfor inflammasome activation is closely related to the particulate\nsize, it is reasonable to link the consequences of THP-1 cells in re-\nsponse to Chry and LIB with their remarkably different physical\nsizes. Chrysotile fibers belong to the group of longer and thinner fi-\nbers; the length of Chry is about 3 times that of LIB, and the mean\nsurface area is about 5\u20136 times that of LIB (see Table 1), suggesting\nthat Chry has more potential to result in aggressive lysosomal rup-\nture and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It has\nbeen well-demonstrated that longer fibers are incapable of under-\ngoing phagocytosis in vitro and in animals [21]. Long fibers have a\ngreater potency than short fibers in assays of pro-inflammatory\nand genotoxic activity [53], and stimulate greater release of IL-1b\nby macrophages [5]. Therefore, further study of the correlations\nbetween particle size and activation of the inflammasome would\nbe particularly interesting. In contrast, LIB probably stimulates\nmore ROS production via a tightly controlled ROS-mediated model\n[51] in which, ROS primes NLRP3 on the one hand, but may impact\ninflammasome activation and down-regulate caspase-1 activity on\nthe other hand.\n\n4.3. Signaling cascade in BEAS-2B cells mediated by the conditioned\nmedium\n\nWe have demonstrated that IL-1b is a major player in THP-1\nconditioned medium, leading to the initiation of the inflammatory\nresponse in the BEAS-2B cells. Besides IL-1b, we also detected lip-\nids peroxides in conditioned medium (Fig. 4D) which is possibly\nanother \u2018\u2018alarm\u2019\u2019 signal that triggers responses in BEAS-2B. How-\never, this should be specifically identified and confirmed in future\nstudies.\n\nCombining our findings with those from others, the process\nthrough which IL-1b triggers BEAS-2B release of IL-6 likely consists\n\n\n\nFig. 9. Proposed schema for Chry and LIB induced signal transduction from the macrophage to the epithelium. In the macrophage \u2018\u2018priming\u2019\u2019 step, the pro-inflammatory\nsignals mediate activation of receptors and induction of NLRP3, procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1b. When macrophages are exposed to chrysotile fibers, phagocytosis is followed by\nphagosomal destabilization and lysosomal rupture. Lysosomal damage results in the release of cathepsin B into the cytosol that triggers three members of NLRP3\ninflammasome to assemble and subsequent activation of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). This second step eventually activates pro-caspase-\n1, which in turn cleaves pro-IL-1b. In comparison to chrysotile, the relatively smaller size of the Libby amphibole probably results in more ROS production via a tightly\ncontrolled ROS-mediated model in which, ROS activate NLRP3, although high oxygen tension can also impact inflammasome function and down-regulate caspase-1 activity.\nIn the epithelial cell, IL-1b signal transduction is initiated through a ligand-induced conformational change in the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitates\nrecruitment of IL-1RacP. Meanwhile, IL-1Ra can block the IL-1b signaling. The trimetric complex rapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, MYD88, and IRAK,\nthen through TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) linked to the downstream protein kinase cascades, including MAPK kinase family, Cot and IjB kinases (IKKs). The\nactivation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads to activation of the AP-1 transcription factor; the IKKb-mediated phosphorylation of p65 modulates NF-jB activity. Both AP-1 and\nNF-jB can directly up-regulate its target gene, IL-6. IL-6 further contributes to asbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma.\n\n728 M. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730\n\n\n\nM. Li et al. / Cytokine 60 (2012) 718\u2013730 729\nof the following steps, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The initial step in IL-\n1b signal transduction is a ligand-induced conformational change\nin the first extracellular domain of the IL-1RI that facilitates\nrecruitment of IL-1RacP. Through conserved cytosolic regions\ncalled Toll- and IL-1R-like (TIR) domains, the trimetric complex\nrapidly assembles two intracellular signaling proteins, myeloid dif-\nferentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and interleukin-1\nreceptor\u2013activated protein kinase (IRAK) [41]. The IL-1R\ufffdTLR\nreceptor-mediated signals, which are linked to the downstream\nprotein kinase cascades, have been studied extensively. Members\nof the MAPK kinase (MAPKKK; called MAP3 K here) family, includ-\ning MEKK1, 2, 3 and Cot (Tpl2 or MAP3K8) are critical in this pro-\ncess [54\u201356]. The activation of ERK1/2 or other MAPKs leads to\nactivation of the AP-1 transcription factor, which could directly\nup-regulate its target gene, IL-6. In addition, the IKKb-mediated\nphosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 requires the upstream kinases\nCot (Tpl2) and PKCf [57]. Then, in turn, IL-6 may act as a significant\nautocrine growth factor in epithelial cells [58,59] to further induce\nasbestos-related pathological phenotypes, such as asbestosis, lung\ncancer, and mesothelioma.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe have investigated the signal transduction from the THP-1\nmacrophages to bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) in response\nto Chry and LIB through direct treatments of THP-1 cells followed\nby THP-1 conditioned medium treatments of BEAS-2B. We found\nthat direct treatments of THP-1 cells with Chry and LIB differen-\ntially activated the inflammasome in processing IL-1b. IL-1b in con-\nditioned medium acts as a secondary mediator to trigger BEAS-2B\ncells signaling cascades, including ERK, Cot, and then AP-1 and NF-\nkB, to induce IL-6, which then leads epithelial cells to pathologic\nphenotypes. Using IL-1Ra could interrupt the interaction and\nmay have a potential therapeutic effect when exposure to patho-\ngenic particles occurs.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Brooke T.

Bladder tissue and urine specimens from cancer patients with\n\ndifferent tumor grades and stages (n 5 68) and from individuals with cystitis (n 5 16) were collected along with biopsy speci-\n\nmens and urine from healthy individuals (n 5 68). For the first time, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that HtrA1 pro-\n\ntein is produced by bladder urothelium in both physiological and inflammatory conditions, whereas it is not detectable in\n\nurothelial cancer cells regardless of tumor grade and stage. A different HtrA1 expression between normal-looking and neoplastic\n\nbladder tissue, despite similar HtrA1 mRNA levels, was also found by western blotting, which disclosed the presence of two forms\n\nof HtrA1, a native form of ~50 kDa and an autocatalytic form of ~38 kDa. Our investigations documented the presence of the two\nforms of HtrA1 also in urine. The ~38 kDa form was significantly down-regulated in neoplastic tissue, whereas significantly higher\namounts of both HtrA1 forms were found in urine from cancer patients compared with both healthy subjects and patients with\n\ncystitis. Our findings suggest that HtrA1 is a downexpressed molecule since an early stage of bladder urothelial carcinoma devel-\n\nopment and that urinary HtrA1 protein may be considered, if successfully validated, as an early and highly sensitive and specific\n\nbiomarker for this neoplasia (the sensitivity and specificity of HtrA1 are 92.65% and 95.59%, respectively).\n\nBladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the West-\nern world, where it is predominantly of the transitional (uro-\nthelial) cell type.1 Approximately 80% of patients with\nurothelial bladder cancer suffer from recurrence within 1 or\n2 years of the initial treatment.2 Fifteen to twenty percent of\nbladder tumors present as muscle-invasive disease; despite\nradical cystectomy (RC) and systemic therapy, 50% of these\npatients die from metastatic disease.3,4 Currently, the gold\nstandard for diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer is\ncystoscopy combined with urine cytology. Cystoscopy is inva-\nsive and expensive, while cytology is scarcely sensitive and is\ncharacterized by poor interobserver reproducibility.5 The bio-\nlogical, morphological and clinical alterations present in\nmalignant and premalignant lesions give the opportunity to\naccurately identify the early stage of cancer progression, sig-\nnificantly enhancing cancer treatment. In recent years, consid-\nerable advances have been made in the study of biomarkers\nassociated with the molecular changes occurring during the\ndevelopment and progression of urothelial carcinoma.6\n\nKey words: human urothelial bladder cancer, serine protease HtrA1,\n\nurinary biomarkers, UROtsa, TCC-SUP, T24 cell lines\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online\n\nversion of this article.\n\n*M.L. and E.A. contributed equally to this work.\n\nGrant sponsor: Banca Marche, Universit\ufffda Politecnica delle Marche,\n\nFutura Onlus.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.28280\n\nHistory: Received 24 June 2012; Accepted 23 Apr 2013; Online 27\n\nMay 2013\n\nCorrespondence to: Teresa Lorenzi, Ph.D., Department of\n\nExperimental and Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty, Universit\ufffda\n\nPolitecnica delle Marche, Via Tronto 10/a, 60020 Torrette, Ancona,\n\nItaly, Tel.: 1[39-071-2206-270], Fax: 1[39-071-2206-087], E-mail:\n\nteresalorenzi@yahoo.it, t.lorenzi@univpm.it or Daniela Marzioni,\n\nDepartment of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty,\n\nUniversit\ufffda Politecnica delle Marche, Via Tronto 10/a, 60020\n\nTorrette, Ancona, Italy, Tel.: 1[39-071-2206-270], Fax: 1[39-071-\n\n2206-087], E-mail: d.marzioni@univpm.it\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\non\n\nan\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\nos\nis\n\nInt.

Through the incorporation of appropriately vali-\ndated biomarkers, one can expect better clinical study designs,\nimproving patients\u2019 prospects by reducing morbidity and\nmortality while curbing costs which, per bladder cancer\npatient from diagnosis to death, are estimated to be the high-\nest among all cancers. Therefore, not only the patients but\nalso the healthcare systems would benefit from the use of bio-\nmarkers.6 Unfortunately, most of the markers tested to date\nseem to add little to current diagnostic methods.6 Therefore,\nthe search is still on for a stand-alone biomarker providing\nfor specific and sensitive early screening and long-term sur-\nveillance of patients with or at risk of bladder cancer.\n\nHtrA1, a member of the family of HtrA proteins, is a\nsecreted multidomain protein with serine protease activity. It\nis characterized by a highly conserved, trypsin-like serine\nprotease domain and at least one PDZ [PSD-95 (Postsynaptic\ndensity protein of Mr 95kDa), Dlg (Drosophila Discs-Large\nprotein) and ZO-1 (Zonula occludens protein 1)] domain.7 It\nalso contains an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein/\nfollistatin/Mac25-like domain and a Kazal-type serine prote-\nase inhibitor motif at its N-terminus.7 Recently, it has been\nshown that HtrA1 can be expressed as a native protein form\nof \ufffd50 kDa and as a \ufffd35 kDa product, whose generation\nrequires the protease activity of HtrA1.8 Serine protease\nHtrA1 is implicated in physiological processes such as TGF-\nb signaling9 and in the pathogenesis of various diseases,\nincluding age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer\u2019s dis-\nease, osteoarthritis and preeclampsia.10\u201313 Changes in its\nexpression associated with specific tumor behavior have also\nbeen reported. HtrA1 down-regulation has been described in\nhuman ovarian cancer14 and is closely related to the progres-\nsion and metastasis of malignant melanoma,15 whereas its\noverexpression has been seen to suppress proliferation and\nmigration of tumor cells in highly invasive melanoma.15\n\nIndeed, several lines of evidence indicate that HtrA1 func-\ntions as a tumor suppressor in various solid tumors, such as\novarian and lung cancer and mesothelioma.16\u201318\n\nThese findings prompted us to investigate whether HtrA1\nderegulation could also be relevant to the development of\n\nurothelial bladder cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the\nrole of HtrA1 has never been investigated in this neoplasm.\nHtrA1 contains a signal sequence for secretion,7 suggesting\nthat it may be recovered in urine. On the other hand, bladder\ncancer is particularly amenable to biomarker development,\nsince secretion of tumor-associated molecules is easily\ndetected in urine. In this study, we evaluated for the first\ntime the expression of the serine protease HtrA1 in healthy\nand neoplastic bladder tissue and urine by real-time PCR,\nimmunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques, sug-\ngesting an early association between expression/processing of\nthis protein with the presence of bladder tumor. In addition,\nwe estimated HtrA1 concentration in urine from healthy\nindividuals and cancer patients by enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA), showing that HtrA1 may be consid-\nered a specific and sensitive biomarker for urothelial bladder\ncancer.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nPatients\n\nThe procedure for this research project conforms to the pro-\nvisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects involved\nin the investigation provided their informed consent.\n\nAs reported in Table 1, the study was conducted with a\ncohort of 68 healthy individuals (controls) [age range 51\u201375\nyears, mean age 6 standard deviation (sd): 66.5 6 5.5] and of\n84 patients, of which 68 affected by urothelial bladder cancer\n[age range 52\u201379 years, mean age 6 sd: 68.2 6 7.0] and 16\naffected by recurrent bacterial cystitis [age range 42\u201379 years,\nmean age 6 sd: 59.1 6 11.8]. Both cancer patients and con-\ntrol group were enrolled in the study consecutively. The 84\npatients presented with one of the following symptoms: gross\nhematuria, microscopic hematuria, urinary urgency or urinary\npain (Table 1). Cystoscopy was the diagnostic procedure used\nto rule out the presence of urothelial carcinoma in patients\nwith persistent inflammation of the bladder (i.e., recurrent bac-\nterial cystitis unresponsive to pharmaceutical therapy). The\ndistribution of the two types of surgical procedure done in\nthe patients with bladder cancer, i.e., transurethral resection of\nthe bladder (TURB) and RC, is reported in Table 1.\n\nSpecimen collection\n\nTissue samples. Bladder tissue from the 68 cancer patients\nand the 16 individuals with cystitis was provided by the\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nFour-fifths of urothelial bladder cancer patients suffer a relapse of disease within one to two years of initial treatment, a prob-\n\nlem that could be alleviated by advances in biomarker-based early stage screening. This investigation introduces one possible\n\nbiomarker, the secreted serine protease HtrA1. While previous studies have suggested that HtrA1 may function as a tumor\n\nsuppressor in certain solid tumors, this report indicates that a reduction in its expression may be an early, highly sensitive\n\nand specific biomarker particularly for urothelial bladder cancer. The recoverability of HtrA1 in urine would allow for a nonin-\n\nvasive means of routine screening.\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\non\n\nan\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\nos\nis\n\nLorenzi et al. 2651\n\nInt. J.

Tumors were graded\naccording to the WHO classification19 and staged according\nto the TNM system20 (Supporting Information Table 1). Pap-\nillary tumor samples with different grades of malignancy\n(n 5 33) were obtained from patients subjected to TURB;\nsamples of invasive urothelial carcinoma (n 5 35), showing\nfocal tumor, came from RC procedures (Supporting Informa-\ntion Table 1). The four different types of bladder specimens\nare described in Table 2. Tissue samples were weighed and\nprepared for molecular (real-time PCR), immunohistochemi-\ncal, and/or biochemical (western blotting) analyses as detailed\nin Table 2. Tissue samples from 1st-trimester placenta (Table\n2) were used as a positive control for real-time PCR (Q-\nPCR),21 immunohistochemistry and western blotting22 (Table\n2). Specimens for Q-PCR and western blotting analyses were\nimmediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\ufffdC,\nthose for immunohistochemistry were fixed for 24 hr in 4%\nneutral buffered formalin at 4\ufffdC and embedded in paraffin.\n\nUrine samples. The urine specimens of the cancer patients,\ncollected on the day of TURB or RC, and those from the cys-\ntitis patients were provided by the Urology Section together\nwith urine samples from the 68 healthy individuals (Table 2).\nThey were analyzed by western blotting and ELISA, as shown\nin Table 2. First-void urine was collected in sterile plastic\ntubes on ice and immediately centrifuged at 1,500g for 15\nmin at 4\ufffdC.

An isotype control antibody (Rabbit IgG, cat. n\ufffd I-100,\nVector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was employed as negative\ncontrol (Supporting Information Table 3).\n\nHtrA1 protein staining per each bladder section at light\nmicroscopy was determined by two separate observers (D.M.\nand M.C.) in a double-blind fashion and was scored with a\nfour-point scale attributed as follows: 1 point (absent stain-\ning), 2 points (low staining), 3 points (moderate staining)\nand 4 points (strong staining). When the pattern of immuno-\nstaining for HtrA1 was nonhomogeneous, the average of the\nscores ascribed to the different parts of the tissue was consid-\nered. The urothelium, stroma, vessels and smooth muscle\ncells were taken into consideration for the HtrA1 expression\nin normal, cystitis, TURB and RC groups.\n\nPreparation of tissue lysates\n\nLysates were obtained as previously described.23 Protein con-\ncentrations of the extracts were assessed with the Bradford\nprotein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy).25\n\nSamples were immunoprecipitated for analysis of the\nexpression of the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 form, whereas they were\ndirectly processed by western blotting for the quantitative\ndetermination of the autocatalytic form.\n\nCell lines and preparation of their whole cell lysates and\n\nconditioned media for western blotting\n\nSV-40 transformed human bladder urothelial cell line (i.e.,\nUROtsa cell line) was a kind gift from Dr. Scott H. Garrett\n(Department of Urology, West Virginia University, Morgan-\ntown, West Virginia, USA). Human bladder transitional car-\ncinoma cell line (i.e., TCC-SUP cell line) was kindly provided\nby Dr. Axel Ullrich (Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry,\nDepartment of Molecular Biology, Martinsried, Germany).\nThe human transitional carcinoma cell line T24 (ATCCVR\n\nNumber: HTB-4\nTM\n\n) was purchased from the American Type\nCulture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD, USA). The cul-\ntures were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented\nwith 10% FBS, at 37\ufffdC in 5% CO2. Eighty percent confluent\ncells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, collected and\nlysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma, Milan, Italy) supplemented with\nprotease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Lysed cells\n\nwere centrifuged at 20,000g to collect supernatant which pro-\ntein concentration was assessed by Bradford protein assay.\nConditioned media were obtained from the confluent cell\ncultures after centrifugation of spent media.\n\nPreparation of urine specimens for western blotting\n\nUrine supernatants were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4\nand Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units\u201430,000\nNMWL (Millipore, Milan, Italy). The samples were normal-\nized on the basis of creatinine concentrations. Concentrated\nurine was immunoprecipitated for analysis of the expression\nof the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 form and directly processed by west-\nern blotting for the quantitative determination of the autoca-\ntalytic form.\n\nImmunoprecipitation\n\nImmunoprecipitation was performed as previously described.23\n\nFor each sample, 3 lg of monoclonal anti-human HTRA1/\nPRSS11 antibody (raised against the recombinant human\nHtrA1, aa 23\u2013480) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (Sup-\nporting Information Table 3) were added to the 50% slurry of\nprewashed GammaBind G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare\nLife Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Two micrograms of\nprotein extract or 225 ll of concentrated urine were\nimmunoprecipitated.\n\nWestern blotting\n\nSamples (immunoprecipitated proteins, 100 lg of tissue\nextract, 50 ll of concentrated urine, 150 lg of the UROtsa,\nTCC-SUP and T24 cell lysates and 40 ll of their conditioned\nmedia) were fractionated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate -\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).26 Western\nblotting analysis was carried out as described before,23 using\nthe monoclonal anti-human HTRA1/PRSS11 antibody (R&D\nSystems) or the monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody, clone AC-\n74 (Sigma) (Supporting Information Table 3).\n\nLevels of HtrA1 and b-actin, used as the tissue house-\nkeeping protein, were quantified by densitometry using\nChemidoc and the Quantity-One program (Bio-Rad Labora-\ntories). The amount of HtrA1 in tissue was expressed as the\nratio of HtrA1 to b-actin, and its amount in urine as densito-\nmetric intensity.\n\nHtrA1 ELISA\n\nSince western blotting analysis may not be the choice method\nfor diagnostics, we tested an HtrA1 ELISA kit purchased\nfrom USCN, Life Science Inc. (DBA Italia s.r.l., Milan, Italy)\nfor sensitive and specific detection of HtrA1 protein in\nvoided urine sample. The immunogen used for preparation\nof the antibody provided with the kit was the recombinant\nhuman HtrA1 (aa 23\u2013480) and internal negative and positive\nquality controls were supplied in each kit. Urine samples\n(100 ll) were added to wells without their previous concen-\ntrations and creatinine was used to normalize HtrA1\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\non\n\nan\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\nos\nis\n\nLorenzi et al. 2653\n\nInt.

The measurements were conducted in dupli-\ncate, according to the supplied protocol.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nHtrA1 transcription and protein levels in tissue specimens\nwere tested using a two-tailed t test (PRISM software, version\n4 for Windows: GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA).\nResults are presented as mean 1 sd. A p value < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\n\nDifferences in urinary HtrA1 among and within groups\nwere evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the\nSAS/STAT software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The data\nobtained from the semi-quantitative immunohistochemical\nanalysis of HtrA1 expression in bladder specimens were\ntested by ANOVA.\n\nAs in our previous study regarding HtrA1,27 the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed in advance to check\nthe normality of variables. Receiver Operating Characteristic\n(ROC) curve was plotted for HtrA1 by the SAS/STAT soft-\nware to assess the accuracy of diagnostic test used to discrim-\ninate between two conditions which, in our study, are\nreferred to as cases (subjects with cancer) and healthy con-\ntrols. The analysis consists in plotting a graph of the sensitiv-\nity versus 1-specificity of the diagnostic test. An area under\nROC curve (AUC) equal to 0.9 \ufffd AUC \ufffd 1.0 was considered\nas a very good performance of the test.28 In addition, we cal-\nculated the proportion of patients with positive test results or\nwith negative test results who are correctly diagnosed (Posi-\ntive Predictive Value: PPV and Negative Predictive Value:\nNPV, respectively). To indicate the precision of the point\nestimate, we used a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\nResults\nExpression of HtrA1 mRNA in bladder tissue\n\nTo determine whether HtrA1 mRNA expression may be\naltered in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, neoplastic and\nnormal-looking bladder specimens were analyzed by Q-PCR.\nNone of the normal, cystitis and TURB samples were exam-\nined by this technique because of the lack of enough fresh\ntissue banking (see Table 2). When SDHA was used as the\nhousekeeping gene, the HtrA1 transcript was not significantly\ndifferent in cancer compared with normal-looking tissue\n(p 5 0.432) (data not shown). Similarly, when TBP was used\nas the housekeeping gene, mRNA expression was similar in\nneoplastic and normal-looking tissue (p 5 0.422) (data not\nshown). Gene expression data collected from Oncomine\nMicroarray database showed no significant difference in the\nvalue of HtrA1 mRNA expression in infiltrating bladder uro-\nthelial carcinoma compared to the corresponding normal-\nlooking counterpart, confirming our results.\n\nHtrA1 immunohistochemistry\n\nImmunohistochemical localization studies disclosed a cyto-\nplasmic staining pattern that was similar in normal, normal-\nlooking (Fig. 1a) and cystitis specimens (Fig. 1b). HtrA1\n\nimmunolabeling was seen in the urothelium, particularly in\nthe umbrella cells lining the bladder lumen (Figs. 1a and 1b).\nThe bladder vessel walls were HtrA1-positive (Figs. 1a\nand 1b).\n\nHtrA1 urothelial immunoreactivity declined with increas-\ning neoplasm grade (Figs. 1c\u20131g). In papillary urothelial neo-\nplasms with low malignant potential (Fig. 1c), the urothelial\ncell cytoplasm was weakly HtrA1-positive in the basal layer\n(Fig. 1c) and largely negative in the upper layer. In addition,\nthe vessel walls were HtrA1-positive (Fig. 1c). The urothelium\nof noninvasive low-grade and high-grade papillary carcino-\nmas (Figs. 1d and 1e) and of invasive neoplasms (Fig. 1f) was\nHtrA1-negative. HtrA1 immunostaining was very weak in\nvessel walls (data not shown). Smooth muscle cells (data not\nshown) and the stroma (Figs. 1a\u20131g) stained weakly or not at\nall for HtrA1 in all samples. The negative controls confirmed\nthe specificity of the immunolabeling obtained with the pri-\nmary antibody. The semi-quantitative immunohistochemical\nanalysis revealed significant differences of HtrA1 expression\nin the urothelium and vessels among normal, cystitis, TURB\nand RC groups (in both the urothelium and vessels p <\n0.0001) (Fig. 1g). On the other hand, HtrA1 expression in\nstroma and muscle cells was not significantly different among\nnormal, cystitis, TURB and RC groups (in stroma p 5 0.14\nand in muscle cells p 5 0.06) (Fig. 1g).\n\nExpression of HtrA1 protein in bladder, UROtsa, TCC-SUP\n\nand T24 cell lines and their conditioned media\n\nAs for Q-PCR, normal, cystitis and TURB samples were not\nanalyzed by western blotting because of the lack of enough\nfresh tissue banking (see Table 2). Representative blots of RC\nspecimens are shown in Figure 2. Immunoblotting with anti-\nHtrA1 antibody disclosed two highly specific bands of \ufffd50\nkDa and \ufffd38 kDa (Fig. 2a), representing the predicted native\nand autocatalytic forms of HtrA1, respectively. The intensity\nof each band was quantified by densitometry in all tissue\nsamples. The \ufffd50 kDa band was not significantly different in\nnormal-looking and neoplastic tissue (p 5 0.320) (Figs. 2a\nand 2b), whereas the \ufffd38 kDa band was strongly reduced\nand in some cases barely detectable in all cancer specimens\n(Fig. 2a). Based on densitometry, the autocatalytic form was\nabout fourfold lower in neoplastic than in normal-looking\ntissue, and the difference was highly significant (p < 0.001)\n(Fig. 2b).\n\nBlot of lysate from UROtsa, TCC-SUP and T24 cells and\nof their conditioned media is shown in Figure 2c. The anti-\nHtrA1 antibody detected only one band of \ufffd50 kDa, corre-\nsponding to the HtrA1 native form, both in UROtsa cell\nlysate and in its conditioned medium. On the contrary,\nHtrA1 was absent in TCC-SUP and T24 cell lysates as well\nas in their conditioned media.\n\nExpression of HtrA1 protein in urine by Western blotting\n\nFigure 3a shows representative blots of the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1\nform detected in urine from patients with bladder cancer,\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\non\n\nan\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\nos\nis\n\n2654 HtrA1 expression in human bladder cancer\n\nInt.

The most\nintriguing aspect of the native form was its close association\nwith urothelial carcinoma. In fact, the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 band\nwas detected in all cancer patients (TURB and RC), while it\nwas very weak and at times nearly absent in healthy individ-\nuals and in patients with cystitis (Fig. 3a). Densitometric\nanalysis showed an about eightfold increase in the levels of\nthe native form in urine from cancer patients compared with\nhealthy subjects and patients with cystitis. These differences\nwere highly significant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3b). A representa-\ntive western blot of the \ufffd38 kDa HtrA1 form is shown in\nFigure 3c. In the same urine specimens, the \ufffd38 kDa form\nwas found to be overexpressed, albeit not homogeneously, in\ncancer patients compared with healthy subjects and patients\nwith cystitis, where it was largely absent (Fig. 3c); the differ-\nences were highly significant (p 5 0.0002) (Fig. 3d).\n\nExpression of HtrA1 protein in urine by ELISA and its\n\ndiagnostic performance\n\nThe detection of urinary HtrA1 protein and the determina-\ntion of its expression levels in urine from patients with uro-\nthelial cancer compared with healthy individuals and patients\nwith cystitis were obtained by the use of the HtrA1 ELISA\nkit. The analysis showed higher levels of HtrA1 in urine\nfrom cancer patients compared with healthy subjects and\npatients with cystitis. These differences were highly signifi-\ncant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4a).\n\nHtrA1 levels were normally distributed in patients with\ncancer (p 5 0.18), in healthy controls (p 5 0.13) and in\npatients with cystitis (p 5 0.77). The global performance of\nour diagnostic test is summarized by the area under the ROC\ncurve (Fig. 4b). Our results showed that AUC is equal to\n0.9839 (C.I. 0.97\u20130.99), highlighting a very good global per-\nformance of the diagnostic test. The sensitivity (SE) and spec-\nificity (SP), using a cutpoint of 1.48 (HtrA1), were 92.65%\n(C.I. 86.44\u201398.85%) and 95.59% (C.I. 90.7\u201399.7%), respec-\ntively. The positive and negative predictive values were:\nPPV 5 95.45% (C.I. 90.42\u201399.7%) and NPV 5 92.86% (C.I.\n86.82\u201398.89%).\n\nDiscussion\nOur immunohistochemical results demonstrate for the first\ntime that HtrA1 protein is produced by the bladder urothe-\nlium both in physiological conditions and in inflammatory\npathologies such as cystitis, whereas it is not found in uro-\nthelial cancer tissue regardless of tumor grade and stage.\n\nThese data suggest that HtrA1 is a downexpressed molecule\nsince an early stage of urothelial carcinoma development.\nThe downexpression of HtrA1 detected in neoplastic urothe-\nlium was not so evident in the other bladder tissue compo-\nnents. The normal-looking and neoplastic bladder specimens\nfrom RC patients did not exhibit significant differences in\nHtrA1 mRNA by real-time PCR. This finding, together with\nimmunohistochemical data, let us to suppose that HtrA1\ntranscription is not affected in urothelial carcinoma, but that\nHtrA1 protein translation is blocked in the pathological uro-\nthelium. Western blotting performed in the specimens from\nRC patients disclosed the coexistence of two HtrA1 protein\nforms: a native form (\ufffd50 kDa) and its autocatalytic product\n(\ufffd38 kDa). Recent data show that the protease active form\nof HtrA1 is represented by its auto-proteolytic product, sug-\ngesting for it a crucial role in proapoptotic activity.8,16,29\n\nSince reduction of apoptosis is a recognized event contribut-\ning to cancer progression,30,31 also in bladder urothelium,32\n\nthe auto-proteolytic protein form may be viewed as a mole-\ncule with anti-cancer properties. Moreover, HtrA1 functions\nas an inhibitor of transforming growth factor (TGF)-b signal-\ning9 and seems to be able to bind and inhibit signaling of a\nwide range of TGF-b family proteins9 as well as to degrade\nTGF-b1 in vitro.33 TGF-b1 is considered to be crucial in uri-\nnary bladder carcinoma tumorigenesis34 and it is also associ-\nated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis,\nmigration and metastasis in many types of malignant\ntumor.35 TGF-b1 is absent in the epithelial cells of normal\nbladder tissues while a strong expression of the protein is\nshown in muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma.36\n\nThus, HtrA1 and TGF-b1 expression patterns seem to be\ninversely correlated in normal and neoplastic bladder tissue.\nSince the inhibitory action of HtrA1 on TGF-b signaling\nwholly depends on its protease activity,9 also in this case the\nautocatalytic form may conceivably have greater anti-cancer\nproperties than the native one. The \ufffd38 kDa HtrA1 form\nwas highly significantly down-regulated in neoplastic com-\npared with normal-looking tissue, whereas the expression of\nthe native form was similar across all specimens. The differ-\nence of 38 kDa HtrA1 form expression between normal-\nlooking and bladder cancer specimens from RC patients\nusing western blotting was weaker than it was expected on\nthe basis of immunohistochemistry. This less marked differ-\nence of HtrA1 expression was due to the analysis of full-\nthickness bladder samples, i.e., inclusive of urothelium (nega-\ntive for HtrA1 in cancer) and of all other bladder tissue\n\nFigure 1.

Taking into account these\nresults, it is plausible that HtrA1 protein is mainly expressed\nin its auto-proteolytic (active) form in normal urothelium, in\norder to be more promptly available to counteract the poten-\ntial risk of cancer related to urinary cytotoxic compounds. Its\ndecreased levels observed in neoplastic urothelial tissue, due\nto a block of protein translation, could be one effector of\ncancer development. This is consistent with the notion that\nHtrA1 functions as a tumor suppressor, as already described\nin human ovarian cancer14 and in malignant melanoma15\n\nwhere the molecule is downexpressed. The loss of HtrA1\nexpression in urothelial carcinoma cells and, on the other\nhand, its presence in normal urothelial cell line UROtsa is\ncongruent with the tumor suppressor role of HtrA1.\n\nHtrA1 autocatalytic form generation may be augmented\nby upregulation of HtrA1 protein, as described in ovarian\ncancer cells under treatment with chemotherapeutic agents\n(cisplatin, paclitaxel).8 The expression of HtrA1 influences\nthe tumor response to chemotherapy by modulating\n\nchemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity8 and HtrA1 is a potential\nprognostic factor of clinical response to cisplatin-based chem-\notherapy for patients with ovarian or gastric cancer.8,37 Con-\nsidering our findings concerning the association between\nHtrA1 autocatalytic form and urothelial bladder cancer, it\nwould be possible to hypothesize that HtrA1 could represent\na valuable tool to predict chemotherapy response also in\npatients with this neoplasm. However, it would be necessary\nto plan a new study based on the analysis of the prognostic\nfactors.\n\nWe found that HtrA1 immunolocalization is particularly\nstrong in the upper portion of the urothelium, suggesting\nrapid release, and that the normal human urothelial cell line\nUROtsa produces and constitutively secretes HtrA1 native\nform into the growth medium, showing that urothelium\ncould be the potential source of HtrA1 in urine. It is notable\nthat normal mammalian urothelium can function not only as\na permeability barrier but also as a possible supply of urinary\nproteins that may play important physiological or pathologi-\ncal roles in the urinary tract.38 We can assume that the\n\nFigure 3.

Moreover, the lack of HtrA1\nproduction and secretion in the medium from urothelial car-\ncinoma cells prompt us to suppose that neoplastic urothelium\ndoes not influence at all urine composition. Surprisingly, our\nwestern blotting investigations documented a very strong\npresence of the \ufffd50 kDa HtrA1 form in urine from patients\nwith different grades and stages of bladder cancer and since\nan early stage of urothelial carcinoma growth. Statistical anal-\nysis demonstrated that HtrA1 (50 kDa form) in this group is\nsignificantly higher than in both healthy individuals and\n\npatients with cystitis. Probably, normal urothelium is forced\nby the flanking tumor tissue to produce more HtrA1 than\nusual, possibly in the attempt to contain tumor progression,\nleading to an increase of secreted HtrA1 native form. Also\nthe level of the \ufffd38 kDa form in urine from cancer patients,\nalthough inhomogeneous, was higher than in healthy subjects\nand in individuals with inflammatory conditions, where it\nwas largely absent. This protein form has lost the secretion\nsignal sequence, thus its recovery in urine from patients with\nurothelial bladder cancer could be related to autoproteolysis\nof the native form rather than to its secretion from bladder\ntissue. The highly variable amount of the \ufffd38 kDa form\n\nFigure 4.

In particular, we\ndocument for the first time, using different experimental\napproaches, that expression of the \ufffd38 kDa form of HtrA1\nprotein is strongly reduced in urothelial cancer tissue regard-\nless of tumor grade and stage. The most significant finding of\nour study is that detection of HtrA1 in urine may represent\nan innovative, simple, specific and sensitive approach to the\nearly diagnosis of bladder malignant transformation. Urine\ncytology and many of the currently developed urine based\nbiomarkers approved by the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), including detection of chromosomal\naneuploidy and deletion using fluorescence in situ hybridiza-\ntion (UroVysion), have limited sensitivity for recognition of\nlow stage and grade tumors.39 A recent study provides the\ndemonstration that NMP22 and CYFRA 21-1, widely used\nover the past decade, are effective markers for detecting blad-\nder cancer40 and there are also several emerging urine\nmarkers, as DNA methylation markers,41 tested extensively\nand looking quite promising, that have not yet been applied\n\nclinically because of lack of validation. HtrA1, in our study,\nshows a very good diagnostic performance (ROC-AUC of\nHtrA1 is 0.9839) and thus, if successfully validated testing\nHtrA1 assay in larger cohorts and with fewer confounders, it\ncould improve the predictive ability of current biomarkers,\nalone or in combination with them, providing a noninvasive\nand practical tool for the routine screening of bladder cancer\nrisk in large population groups. We recognize some limita-\ntions of our study. We show gender disparity between cancer\npatients and subjects with cystitis, meaning that the ratio\nbetween females and males is about 1:3 for patients with uro-\nthelial carcinoma and 3:1 for infection group. However, it is\nrecognized in literature that bladder cancer is 3 to 4 times\nmore frequent in men than in women and that urinary tract\ninfections occur more commonly in women than men.\nAnother limitation of the study consists in the fact that while\ncarrying out a consecutive enrollment of all subjects, matched\ncontrol cohort by age (6 1 year) and gender was not used.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. Alessandro Conti (Universit\ufffda Politecnica\ndelle Marche, Italy) and Dr. Carlo Vecchioli (Presidio Ospedali Riuniti\nMurri-Jesi, Italy) for providing some of the specimens.

However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of\ncytokine expression by MKP-1, especially at the post-transcriptional level, have not been fully delineated.\nIn the current study, MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylated activated MAPK responses and attenuated\nLPS-induced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a expression. In addition, MKP-1 was important in destabilizing\ncytokine mRNAs. In LPS-stimulated rat macrophages with overexpressed MKP-1, half-lives of IL-6,\nIL-10 and TNF-a mRNAs were significantly reduced compared to controls. Conversely, half-lives of\nIL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a mRNAs were significantly increased in bone marrow macrophages derived from\nMKP-1 knock out (KO) mice compared with macrophages derived from MKP-1 wild type (WT) mice.\nFurthermore, MKP-1 promoted translocation of RNA-binding protein (RNA-BP) ARE/poly-(U) binding\ndegradation factor 1 (AUF1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to LPS stimulation as evi-\ndenced by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Knockdown AUF1 mRNA expression by AUF1\nsiRNA in MKP-1 WT bone marrow macrophages significantly delayed degradation of IL-6, IL-10 and\nTNF- a mRNAs compared with controls. Finally, AUF1 was immunoprecipitated with the RNA complex\nin cellular lysates derived from bone marrow macrophages of MKP-1 KO vs. WT mice, which had\nincreased AUF1-bound target mRNAs, including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a in WT macrophages compared\nwith MKP-1 KO macrophages. Thus, this work provides new mechanistic insight of MKP-1 signaling\nand regulation of cytokine mRNA stability through RNA binding proteins in response to inflammatory\nstimuli.\n\n\ufffd 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nMAPK pathways are essential immune response signaling path-\nways in mammalian cells that respond to external stress stimuli,\ngrowth factors, or infectious microorganisms [1,2]. There are three\nwell-known subfamilies of MAPKs, including ERK, JNK, and p38\nMAPK [3]. Numerous studies have revealed that ERK is mainly acti-\nvated by growth factors and hormones, whereas JNK and p38\nll rights reserved.\n\nSP1, dual specificity protein\nments; RNA-BP, RNA-binding\nctor 1; TTP, tristetraprolin;\n\nection; MK2, MAPK-activated\nrecipitation.\nicrobiology and Immunology,\nve., BSB 449, Charleston, SC\n843 792 5312.\nMAPK are activated by stress stimuli; therefore, JNK and p38 MAPK\nare also referred to as stress-activated kinases (SAPKs) [1]. Activa-\ntion of the MAPK cascade initiates phosphorylation of downstream\nproteins including numerous transcription factors such as AP-1,\nCREB, NF-jB, STAT, nuclear hormone receptors, and nucleosomal\nproteins [1,2]. Thus, activation of MAPKs leads to production of\nvarious pro-inflammatory/or anti-inflammatory cytokines in re-\nsponse to stress stimuli. MAPKs play an essential role in the regu-\nlation of many physiological processes, including cell proliferation,\ndifferentiation, development, immune response, stress responses,\nand apoptosis [4].\n\nAlthough activation of the MAPKs pathways is critical for\nmounting an aggressive immune response to eliminate invading\npathogens and neutralize external insults, an exaggerated MAPK\nresponse can be deleterious to the host. In fact, an exaggerated\nMAPK response is associated with the pathophysiology of various\nhuman diseases, such as septic shock [5], autoimmune diseases\n[6], bone resorption [7], neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer\n[8,9]. Therefore, regulation of both the duration and magnitude\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.006\nmailto:klkirk@musc.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.006\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n246 H. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\nof MAPK activation is necessary to maintain immune homeostasis\nand prevent harmful effects associated with an exaggerated MAPK\nresponse.\n\nIn mammalian cells, MAPKs are primarily inactivated by a group\nof dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DUSPs) called MAPK\nphosphatases (MKPs), which dephosphorylate both the tyrosine\nand threonine residues of activated MAPKs [3]. MKP-1/DUSP1 is\nthe first mammalian MKP identified and it is induced by various\nstress stimuli, such as bacterial infection, UV light, hypoxia, heat\nshock, and oxidants [3]. Studies in MKP-1 KO mice revealed that\nMKP-1 KO mice were susceptible to endotoxic shock; the mice\nhad increased production of proinflammamtory cytokines [10,11]\nand increases in the incidence and severity of experimentally in-\nduced autoimmune arthritis [12]. Also, the mice were more sensi-\ntive to hydrogen-peroxide-induced apoptosis [13], and they\nremained susceptible to the development of glucose intolerance\nand hyperinsulinemia caused by high-fat feeding [14] compared\nwith wild type (WT) animals. These results suggest a critical role\nfor MKP-1 in negative regulation of innate immune response to\nbacterial infection and modulation of cellular growth, apoptosis,\nand metabolism. However, the mechanisms underlying how\nMKP-1 restrains immune responses have not been fully defined,\nespecially at the post-transcriptional level.\n\nIt is well-known that many short-lived mRNAs, including mRNA\nencoding cytokines, proto-oncogenes, growth factors, transcrip-\ntional activators, cell cycle regulatory proteins, and various inflam-\nmatory mediators carry adenine and uridine (AU)-rich elements\n(AREs) in the 30-untranslated region (30-UTR) [15\u201319]. Some\nRNA-binding proteins (RNA-BPs) specifically bind with those ARE\nregions of mRNAs. RNA-BPs shuttle between the cytoplasm and\nthe nucleus, contributing to the regulation of RNA splicing, export,\nsurveillance, decay, and translation [20]. Two RNA-BPs that specif-\nically bind to the defined ARE region of mRNAs to mediate their\ndegradation are AUF1 and tristetraprolin (TTP) [21,22].\n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms of MKP-1 regulation\nof cytokine response is critical for understanding innate immunity\nand mechanisms of immune tolerance. Using gain-or loss-of-func-\ntion strategies, we evaluated the role of MKP-1 in regulation of\nMAPK protein and cytokine expression, cytokine mRNA and cyto-\nkine mRNA stability, and its relationship with RNA-BPs. The pres-\nent study provides new evidence that MKP-1 regulates cytokine\nexpression post-transcriptionally by altering nuclear export of\nAUF1.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cells and reagents\n\nRat macrophage NR8383 cells and mouse fibroblast L929 cells\nwere obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC, Manas-\nsas, VA). NR8383 cells were cultured with Ham\u2019s F12K medium\n(ATCC), supplemented with 15% heat inactivated FBS, 100 unit/ml\npenicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin in a 37 \ufffdC incubator with\n5% CO2. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293A cell line was\npurchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). L929 and 293A cells\nwere cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%\nFBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin in a\n37 \ufffdC incubator with 5% CO2. L929 supernatant, a source of\nM-CSF, was harvested from L929 cells grown for 7 days after con-\nfluency. LPS from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 (L4516) was purchased\nfrom Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and diluted in PBS. Actinomycin\nD was obtained from CalBiochem (San Diego, CA). Mouse Accell\nSMARTpool AUF1 siRNA (E-042940-00) and control Accell Non-tar-\ngeting Pool siRNA (D-001910-10) were obtained from Dharmacon\n(Lafayette, CO).\n2.2. Animals and primary cells\n\nMKP-1 KO and WT mice were obtained through a Material\nTransfer Agreement from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NY) and bred at\nthe Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Animal genotype\nwas confirmed by animal DNA genotype PCR assays. All animal-re-\nlated work was performed in accordance with NIH guidelines, and\nprotocols were approved by the MUSC Institutional Animal Care\nand Use Committee. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing\nthe femur and tibia marrow cavities of 6\u20138-week-old mice. Iso-\nlated bone marrow cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS,\n30% L929 supernatant (a supplement of M-CSF), and antibiotics\nfor 7 days to induce the formation of bone marrow macrophages.\n\n2.3. Adenovirus\n\nAdenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-CMV-MKP-1, which expresses the\nfull-length of MKP-1 gene, and control Ad5-CMV-LacZ were ob-\ntained from Seven Hills Bioreagents (Cincinnati, OH). Adenovirus\nwere propagated in HEK 293A cells, purified by cesium chloride\ndensity gradient ultracentrifugation method, and desalted by\nPD-10 column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) in HEPES buffered\nsaline.\n\n2.4. Western blot assays\n\nTotal proteins were extracted by RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Beverly, MA) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor\ncocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN). The nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were ex-\ntracted by NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents\n(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s instruction. Proteins were loaded on 10% or 12% Tris\u2013HCl\nReady Gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and electrotrans-\nferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% milk, and then\nincubated overnight at 4 \ufffdC with primary antibodies. Anti-MKP-1\n(M-18) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa\nCruz, CA). Antibodies to p-p38 MAPK; p-SAPK/JNK; p-p44/42\nMAPK (Erk1/2); p38 MAPK, p-NF-jB p65, Lamin A/C, and GAPDH\nwere purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-AUF1 was\nobtained from (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The anti-TTP was ob-\ntained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The presence of the primary\nantibodies was detected on radiographic film by using HRP-conju-\ngated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and\nSuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fish-\ner Scientific, Rockford, IL). Digitalized images of the radiographic\nfilms were obtained in a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad\nLaboratories).\n\n2.5. ELISA\n\nIL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IL-1b, CXCL1, M-CSF, IFN-c and a PGE2\nparameter assay ELISA kits were purchased from R&D systems\n(Minneapolis, MN). Protein concentration in cell lysates was deter-\nmined by DC protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The concen-\ntration of cytokines in cell culture supernatant was normalized by\nprotein concentrations in cell lysates.\n\n2.6. RT-qPCR\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from cells using TRIZOL (Invitrogen)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and quantified by a\nspectrophotometer.

Amplicon primers of rat IL-6\n(Rn01410330_m1), rat TNF-a (Rn99999017_m1), rat IL-10\n(Rn99999012_m1), rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-\nnase (GAPDH, Rn01775763_g1), mouse IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1),\nmouse TNF-a (Mm00443258_m1), mouse IL-10 (Mm00\n439615_g1), mouse AUF1 (Mm01201314_m1), mouse beta-actin\n(Mm01205647_g1), and mouse GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1) were\nobtained from Applied Biosystems. Amplicon concentration was\ndetermined using threshold cycle values compared with standard\ncurves for each primer. IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10, and AUF1 mRNA levels\nwere normalized to endogenous control beta-actin or GAPDH\nexpression and expressed as fold change compared with control\ngroups. The half-life (t\u00bd) of mRNA was determined as previously de-\nscribed [23].\n\n2.7. Immunofluorescence\n\nBone marrow derived macrophages were fixed with 2% para-\nformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After wash-\ning with PBS for three times, the cells were permeabilized with\n0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT. After washing by\nPBS, the cells were blocked by 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at\nRT. After a second washing with PBS, the cells were incubated\nwith anti-AUF1 (1:100, Millipore) with 1% BSA overnight at 4 \ufffdC.\nCells were washed again with PBS, and incubated with an\nAlexa-488 labeled secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) with\n1% BSA for 1 h at RT. After another PBS wash, cells were incubated\nwith Alexa phalloidin 568 (1:10, Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT. Cells\nwere washed again with PBS and mounted on a slide with Pro-\nlong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI reagent (Invitrogen), cov-\nered with coverslip, and incubated at RT overnight. Digital\nimages were recorded using confocal microscopy (Leica, Bannock-\nburn, IL).\n\n2.8. AUF1 RIP-RT-qPCR\n\nRNA-BP immunoprecipitation (RIP) and mRNA isolation was\npreviously described [24]. Briefly, protein A agarose beads (Sigma)\nwere either coated with anti-AUF1 (15 lg) or an equal amount of\ncontrol normal rabbit serum (Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 \ufffdC in\na rotating device overnight. After serial washing, cell lysates\n(2 mg) from bone marrow macrophages were immunoprecipi-\ntated with protein A-coated agarose beads overnight at 4 \ufffdC in a\nrotating device. Ten percent cell lysates were reserved as input\ncontrol. After serial washing, the IP products were digested with\nproteinase K, and RNA was isolated. RNA was extracted using\nphenol and chloroform and precipitated in the presence of glyco-\ngen. For analysis of individual mRNAs, the RNA isolated from the\nIP was subjected to reverse transcription (RT) using random hexa-\nmers and SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplifi-\ncation and quantification of the PCR products were performed\nusing the Applied Biosystems Stepone Plus system (Applied\nBiosystems) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Bio-\nsystems). Input beta actin mRNA was used as a loading control.\nEach reaction was carried out in triplicate and three independent\nexperiments were performed.\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\n\nData were analyzed with the paired or unpaired two-tailed Stu-\ndent\u2019s t test with Welch\u2019s correction for unequal variances. All sta-\ntistical tests were performed using a GraphPad Prism software\n(GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). P-values of 0.05 or less were\nconsidered significant.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Ad.MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylates activated MAPKs after LPS\nstimulation\n\nTo test the efficacy of exogenous over-expression of MKP-1 by\nAd.MKP-1, rat macrophages (NR8383 cells) were transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 or control vector, Ad.LacZ, at multiplicity of infection\n(MOI) from 100 to 900 for 24\u201372 h. Optimal MKP-1 protein expres-\nsion was achieved at 300 MOI for 48 h (data not shown). The LacZ\ngene expression was confirmed by b-galactosidase staining in cells\n(data not shown). Next, to verify how MKP-1 affects immune signal-\ning pathways, rat macrophages were transduced with either\nAd.MKP-1 or Ad.LacZ (300 MOI), or treated with equal volume of\nHEPES buffered saline. Forty-eight hours after the adenoviral trans-\nduction, the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 lg/ml) for 10, 30, 60,\nand 120 min. Then, MKP-1 protein, p-MAPKs and p-NF-jB p65 were\nmeasured by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1, when nitrocellulose\nmembrane was incubated with a low concentration of anti-MKP-1\n(1:1500), rat macrophages transduced with Ad.MKP-1 displayed\nmodest MKP-1 protein expression without LPS stimulation. How-\never, the MKP-1 protein was significantly induced in those trans-\nduced cells 60 and 120 min after LPS stimulation. In contrast, rat\nmacrophages transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated with HEPES buf-\nfered saline exhibited undetectable MKP-1 protein levels before or\nafter LPS stimulation. When the nitrocellulose membrane was incu-\nbated with a higher concentration of anti-MKP-1 (1:500), there was\nonly weak MKP-1 protein expression 60 and 120 min after LPS stim-\nulation in macrophages transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated with\nHEPES buffered saline (data not shown). Importantly, macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1 significantly reduced p-JNK, p-ERK, and\np-p38 after LPS stimulation compared with cells transduced with\nAd.LacZ or treated with HEPES buffered saline. The enhanced\nMKP-1 protein expression 60\u2013120 min after LPS stimulation was\ncorrelated with significant dephosphorylation of those activated\nMAPKs in transduced cells. However, macrophages transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 failed dephosphorylating activated NF-jB p65, which\nsuggested that Ad.MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylated activated\nMAPKs, not activated NF-jB signaling pathway.\n3.2. MKP-1 selectively attenuates IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 cytokine\nproduction after LPS stimulation\n\nAfter toll-like receptor (TLR) engagement, LPS triggers a cascade\nof signal transduction events that lead to the formation of the\nMyD88/TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) complex, and\nsubsequently triggers activation of NF-jB and MAPKs [25].\nActivation of NF-jB and MAPKs, in turn, leads to phosphorylation\nof transcriptional factors and/or RNA-BPs, which controls the mag-\nnitude and duration of many pro-inflammatory/or anti-inflamma-\ntory cytokine responses. To investigate the effects of MKP-1 on\npro-inflammatory/or anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, rat\nmacrophages were transduced with Ad.MKP-1 or control Ad.LacZ\n(300 MOI) for 48 h. The cells were subsequently stimulated with\nLPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IL-1b, CXCL1, M-CSF,\nIFN-c, and PGE2 in cell culture supernatant were measured with\nELISA.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2a\u2013c, rat macrophages transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 significantly attenuated IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 produc-\ntion 24 h after LPS stimulation compared with cells transduced\nwith Ad.LacZ (n = 5, \u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001). Compared with\nmacrophages transduced with Ad.LacZ, macrophages transduced\nwith Ad.MKP-1 had an approximately 2.0-fold decrease in IL-6; a\n2.0-fold decrease in TNF-a, and a 4.0-fold decrease in IL-10 after\nLPS stimulation. However, there was no significant difference in\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Ad.MKP-1 specifically dephosphorylated MAPKs in rat macrophages after LPS stimulation. Rat macrophages were transduced with either Ad.MKP-1, or control Ad.LacZ\n(300 MOI), or treated with HEPES buffered saline for 48 h. Cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with 1 lg/ml of LPS (from Escherichia coli 0127:B8) for indicated time\nperiods. MKP-1, p-JNK (p54, p46), p-p38, p-ERK (p44, p42), p-38 MAPK, and p-NF-jB p65 protein expressions were evaluated by Western blot assay. Total p-38 MAPK served\nas a loading control.\n\nFig. 2.

Other cytokines, such as M-CSF, PGE2, and IFN-\nc were below detection levels (data not shown).\n\nTo further confirm that MKP-1 regulates IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10\nproduction, primary bone marrow macrophages from MKP-1 KO\nor WT mice were either untreated or stimulated with LPS\n(100 ng/ml) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2d\u2013f, bone marrow macro-\nphages from MKP-1 KO mice had a 2.7-fold increase in IL-6; a\n3.3-fold increase in TNF-a; and a 2.3-fold increase in IL-10 com-\npared with WT mice (n = 3, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001). Together, these\nresults confirm that MKP-1 specifically down-regulates IL-6, TNF-a\nand IL-10 production.\n\n\n\nH. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255 249\n3.3. MKP-1 inhibits IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 mRNA levels after LPS\nstimulation\n\nActivated MAPKs phosphorylate numerous downstream target\nproteins, including transcriptional factors and RNA-BPs, which\ncan regulate expression of multiple inflammatory genes at either\nthe transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. To delineate the\nrole of MKP-1 in steady state mRNA modulation, mRNA of IL-6,\nTNF-a, and IL-10 were quantified after LPS stimulation. Rat macro-\nphages transduced by Ad.MKP-1 or control Ad.LacZ (300 MOI) for\n48 h were either unstimulated or stimulated with LPS (100 ng/\nml) for 4, and 8 h separately. As shown in Fig. 3a\u2013c, mRNA of IL-\n6, TNF-a, and IL-10 was significantly reduced in macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1 compared with mRNA in cells trans-\nduced with Ad.LacZ (n = 4, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001).\n\nTo complement gain-of-function experiments, primary bone\nmarrow macrophage cells from MKP-1 KO or WT mice were either\nuntreated or stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 and 8 h sepa-\nrately. As shown in Fig. 3d\u2013f, the mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-a, and\nIL-10 from MKP-1 KO mice were significantly higher than mRNA\nfrom MKP-1 WT mice after LPS stimulation (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05,\n\u2044\u2044p < 0.01, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001). These results support the idea that MKP-\n1 plays a negative regulatory role in mRNA expression of IL-6,\nTNF-a, and IL-10 after activation of MAPKs by LPS stimulation.\nFig. 3.

MKP-1 enhances the degradation of the mRNAs of IL-6, TNF-a, and\nIL-10 after LPS stimulation\n\nBecause cytokine mRNA stability is affected by the p38 MAPK\nsignaling pathway, including MAPK-activated protein kinase 2\n(MK2) [26], we examined the role of MKP-1 in regulation cytokine\nmRNA stability by performing actinomycin D chase experiments.\nRat macrophages transduced by Ad.MKP-1 or Ad.LacZ (300 MOI)\nfor 48 h were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 h. Actinomycin\nD (10 lg/ml) was added to the cell culture to arrest RNA transcrip-\ntion, and total remaining cytoplasmic RNA was evaluated at vari-\nous time points after addition of actinomycin D. As shown in\nFig. 4a\u2013c, cytokine mRNAs were rapidly degraded in macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1, with a t1/2 of 2.9 h for IL-6 mRNA; 1.5 h\nfor TNF-a mRNA; and 2.4 h for IL-10 mRNA. In contrast, the t1/2 of\nmRNAs in macrophages treated with Ad.LacZ significantly in-\ncreased 2.1-fold for IL-6 mRNA (t\u00bd = 6.0 h) (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05,\n\u2044\u2044p < 0.01); 1.8-fold for TNF-a mRNA (t\u00bd = 2.7 h) (n = 3, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01,\n\u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001); and 1.7-fold for IL-10 mRNA (t\u00bd = 4.0 h) (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01).\n\nTo further validate that MKP-1 signaling pathway plays a\ncrucial role in controlling degradation of cytokine mRNA, we\nperformed mRNA decay studies in primary bone marrow macro-\nphages from MKP-1 KO and WT mice. As shown in Fig. 4d\u2013f, bone\nes were transduced with Ad.MKP-1 or control Ad.LacZ (300 MOI) for 48 h.

Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\nmarrow macrophages from MKP-1 KO mice exhibited slower deg-\nradation of IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 mRNAs than macrophages from\nWT mice. Cytokine mRNA was rapidly degraded in macrophages\nderived from WT mice, with calculated t1/2 = 3.5 h for IL-6 mRNA,\n0.3 h for TNF-a mRNA, and 0.9 h for IL-10 mRNA. In contrast, the\nt1/2 of mRNA in macrophages derived from MKP-1 KO mice signif-\nicantly increased 1.5-fold for IL-6 mRNA (t\u00bd = 5.4 h) (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01); 2.0-fold for TNF-a mRNA (t\u00bd = 0.6 h) (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01); and 1.6-fold for IL-10 mRNA (t\u00bd = 1.4 h)\n(n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01). Together, these results suggest that\nsignaling through MKP-1 dependent pathways is required for\npromoting cytokine mRNA degradation.\n\n3.5. MKP-1 modulates subcellular translocalization of AUF1\n\nRNA-BP AUF1 and TTP can bind AREs in the 30-UTR of many\ninflammatory target gene mRNAs, facilitating mRNA degradation\n[26,27]. To define which RNA-BP contributes to cytokine mRNA\ndestabilization related to MKP-1, we evaluated subcellular locali-\nzation of MKP-1, p-MAPK, AUF1 and TTP in the cytoplasm vs. in nu-\ncleus. Rat macrophages were transduced with Ad.MKP-1 or\nAd.LacZ (300 MOI), or treated with an equal volume of HEPES buf-\nfered saline for 48 h. Cells were then either left unstimulated or\nwere stimulated with LPS (1 lg/ml) for 2 and 4 h. The cytoplasmic\nand nuclear proteins were extracted and analyzed using Western\nblot. As shown in Fig. 5a, MKP-1 protein was mainly induced in\nthe cytoplasm at 2 and 4 h after LPS stimulation in cells transduced\nwith Ad.MKP-1. MKP-1 was undetectable in cells either transduced\nwith Ad.LacZ or treated with HEPES buffered saline both in the\ncytoplasm and in the nucleus. In cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1,\nwith greater MKP-1 induction, there was a significant decrease of\np-p38, p-JNK, and to a lesser extent, p-ERK expression, in the cyto-\nplasm compared with cells transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated\nwith HEPES buffered saline. p-p38 and p-JNK were mainly\nexpressed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, p-ERK was distributed in\nboth the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\n\n\n\nFig. 5. MKP-1 modulates subcellular translocalization of AUF1. Rat macrophages were transduced with Ad.MKP-1 or control Ad.LacZ (300 MOI), or treated with HEPES\nbuffered saline for 48 h.

The macrophages were either unstimulated or stimulated\nwith 1 lg/ml of LPS (from Escherichia coli 0127:B8) for 2 or 4 h.

These data are representative\nof three separate experiments.\n\nH. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255 251\nIn macrophages transduced with Ad.MKP-1, there was a signif-\nicant increase in AUF1 (p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1) in\nthe cytoplasm and a slight decrease in AUF1 (p37AUF1, p40AUF1,\np42AUF1 and p45AUF1) in the nucleus 4 h after LPS stimulation\n(Fig. 5a\u2013c, n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05), suggesting that AUF1 shuttles from\nthe nucleus to the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation. In contrast, in\n\n\n\n252 H. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\ncells transduced with Ad.LacZ or treated with HEPES buffered sal-\nine, there was a modest decrease in AUF1 in the cytoplasm and a\nconcomitant increase in nuclear AUF1 post-LPS stimulation. Cyto-\nplasmic TTP expression was induced in all cells stimulated with\nLPS, and no treatment group was significantly different.\n\nTo confirm that AUF-1 subcellular translocation is related to\nMKP-1 status, bone marrow macrophage from MKP-1 KO or WT\nmice were either untreated or stimulated with LPS (1 lg/ml) for\n2 and 4 h. The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted\nand analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5b\u2013d, AUF1\n(p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1) was moderately increased\nin the cytoplasm and decreased in the nucleus in macrophages de-\nrived from WT mice 4 h after LPS stimulation (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05). In\ncontrast, AUF1 (p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1) was moder-\nately reduced in the cytoplasm and increased in the nucleus in\nmacrophages derived from MKP-1 KO mice. TTP expression was\nonly induced in the cytoplasm stimulated by LPS, and was not\ndetectable in nuclear fractions of bone marrow macrophages. In\naddition, there was no significant difference in cytoplasmic expres-\nsion of TTP observed in LPS stimulated WT and MKP-1 KO macro-\nphages. Together these results demonstrate that signaling through\nMKP-1 specifically promotes translocation of AUF1 from the nu-\ncleus to the cytoplasm in response to LPS stimulation, but not TTP.\n\nTo confirm that MKP-1 promotes AUF1 cytoplasmic trafficking\nin response to LPS stimulation, we immunofluorescently stained\nbone marrow cells derived from MKP-1 KO vs. WT mice. Cells were\ntreated with LPS for 4 h or left untreated. As shown in Fig. 6, AUF1\nwas primarily present in the nucleus in both MKP-1 KO and WT\ncells prior to LPS stimulation. Post-LPS stimulation, AUF1 remained\nin the nucleus in KO mice macrophages, whereas AUF1 was prefer-\nentially localized to the cytoplasm or localized to both the\nFig. 6.

Five fields (about 100 cells) from each sam\ncytoplasm and the nucleus in WT macrophages. These results sup-\nport the previous observation that MKP-1 signaling promotes AUF1\nnuclear\u2013cytoplasmic translocation after LPS stimulation.\n\nTo conclude that MKP-1-mediated mRNA decay is via AUF1, siR-\nNA, experiments were performed in MKP-1 WT bone marrow cells.\nBone marrow macrophages from MKP-1 WT mice were treated\nwith either Accell SMARTpool AUF1 siRNA or control Accell Non-\ntargeting Pool siRNA (500 nM) for 72 h. Then the cells were stimu-\nlated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 h. RNA decay assay was performed\nafter addition of actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 7a, macrophages\ntreated with AUF1 siRNA significantly reduced AUF1 mRNA expres-\nsion compared with cells treated with control scrambled (Scr) siR-\nNA (n = 3, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001). Cytokine mRNAs were degraded slower in\nmacrophages treated with AUF1 siRNA compared with controls\n(Fig. 7b\u2013d). The t1/2 of mRNA in macrophages treated with control\nscrambled siRNA was calculated 1.8 h for IL-6 mRNA, 0.4 h for TNF-\na mRNA, and 0.8 h for IL-10 mRNA. In contrast, the t1/2 of mRNA in\nmacrophages treated with AUF1 siRNA significantly increased 1.6-\nfold for IL-6 mRNA (t\u00bd = 2.9 h) (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01); 2.0-fold\nfor TNF-a mRNA (t\u00bd = 0.8 h) (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05); and 1.4-fold for IL-10\nmRNA (t\u00bd = 1.1 h) (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05). These results confirm that\nAUF1 plays an important role in mediating IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10\nmRNA decay. Together with previous results, we further conclude\nthat MKP-1-mediated mRNA decay is via AUF1.\n\nTo confirm that AUF1 cytoplasmic trafficking correlated with\nthe conjugated amount of cytokine mRNA, a RNA-BP Immunopre-\ncipitation (RIP)-RT-qPCR experiments were performed in which\nprotein A agarose beads coated with anti-AUF1 (Millipore) or nor-\nmal rabbit serum (Cell signaling) were immunoprecipitated with\nprotein lysates from MKP-1 WT vs. KO cells with or without LPS\nstimulation. mRNA was extracted from RIP products, and cytokine\nacrophages were either harvested from MKP-1 KO or WT mice. Cells were either\ne cells were stained AUF1 by immunofluorescence staining. The nucleus was stained\neach experiment, each sample was duplicated. Digital images were recorded using\nple were counted. Results are representative of three separate experiments.\n\n\n\nFig. 7. AUF1 was associated with degradation of IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 mRNA. Bone marrow cells from MKP-1 WT mice were treated with either Accell SMARTpool AUF1\nsiRNA or control Accell Non-targeting Pool siRNA (500 nM) for 72 h. Cells were then stimulated with LPS (from Escherichia coli 0127:B8, 100 ng/ml) for 4 h. RNA decay assay\nwas performed after addition of actinomycin D. (a) AUF1 mRNA expression (n = 3, \u2044\u2044\u2044p < 0.001). (b) IL-6 mRNA remaining percentage (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01). (c) TNF-a\nmRNA remaining percentage (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05). (d) IL-10 mRNA remaining percentage (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05). These data are representative of three separate experiments.\n\nH. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255 253\nmRNA was measured using real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 8a\u2013c,\nmore AUF1-conjugated IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a mRNA were observed\nin WT cells compared with KO cells post-LPS stimulation (n = 3,\n\u2044p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044p < 0.01). There was a 1.6-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA,\na 2.3-fold increase in TNF-a mRNA, and a 2.0-fold increase in IL-\n10 mRNA in WT cells post-LPS stimulation compared with mRNA\nin KO cells. No target cytokine expression was detected in cells\nwithout LPS stimulation, or in control groups of protein A agarose\nbeads coated with normal rabbit serum. These results demonstrate\nthat AUF1 cytoplasmic trafficking in MKP-1 WT cells is correlated\nwith increases in AUF1-conjugated IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a mRNAs, and\nfurther degradation of those cytokine mRNAs.\n4. Discussion\n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cytokine\nregulation by MKP-1 is critical for comprehension of immune cyto-\nkine restraint and immune homeostasis after inflammatory stim-\nuli. The current study confirms an essential role of MKP-1 in\nmodulating cytokine production in response to inflammatory stim-\nuli and provides new insights regarding how MKP-1 controls sub-\ncellular localization of RNA-BP, and subsequently affects mRNA\nstability. Ectopic expression of MKP-1 specifically dephosphoryl-\nated exaggerated? MAPK activity after LPS stimulation, but not\nthe NF-jB signaling pathway. Over-expression of MKP-1 selec-\ntively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-a, and\nanti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production and increased the\ndegradation of those cytokine mRNAs. This increased degradation\nof specific cytokine mRNAs was associated with the increased\nAUF1 shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and enhanced\nAUF1-conjugated IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10 mRNA.\n\nOf note, exogenous expression of MKP-1 by Ad.MKP-1 did not\ninduce increased MKP-1 protein expression in unstimulated cells.\nIncreased MKP-1 protein expression was only observed 60 and\n120 min after LPS stimulation. Without any stimulus, macrophages\ntransduced with Ad.MKP-1 did not suppress cytokine responses.\nMKP-1 only attenuated the cytokine responses after the LPS stim-\nulus. Interestingly, over-expression of exogenous MKP-1 not only\nattenuated the pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNF-a) response,\nbut also decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) after LPS\nstimulation. This demonstrates that MKP-1 gene activation is\ndependent on stress stimuli and activation of MAPKs. MKP-1 acti-\nvation is essential for attenuation exaggerated MAPKs activities\nand maintaining immune homeostasis.\n\nIn this study, over-expression of MKP-1 failed to dephosphory-\nlate activated NF-jB, suggesting that MKP-1 specifically dephos-\nphorylates MAPK, not the NF-jB signaling pathway. With\nexogenous over-expression of MKP-1, IL-1b and CXCL1 were not\nsignificantly different between cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1\nand cells transduced with Ad.LacZ, which indicates that IL-1b and\nCXCL1 might be controlled by other signal pathways, such as the\nNF-jB pathway. Although other investigators [27] have reported\nthat MKP-1 inhibited NF-jB activity, they suggested that MKP-1\ndid not regulate the phosphorylation of IjB, and, instead MKP-1\nmight regulate NF-jB activity at the translational level.\n\nPhosphorylation of MAPKs modulates downstream coregula-\ntory proteins, and nucleosomal proteins, which are implicated in\nthe regulation of cellular localization of various transcriptional fac-\ntors, and affect mRNA export, localization, stability and translation\n[1]. In a cDNA array study [28] using probes for 950 ARE-contain-\ning mRNA, 45 AU-rich mRNA decayed at least 1.5 times\u2014and up to\n6.6 times\u2014faster in the presence of p38 inhibitor. The cDNA array\nstudy agrees with our observations: MKP-1 not only inhibits mRNA\ntranscription of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a), anti-inflam-\nmatory cytokine (IL-10), but also affects the degradation of those\ncytokine mRNAs. Cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1 had significantly\nincreased rates of mRNA degradation compared with cells trans-\nduced with Ad.LacZ. Conversely, macrophages from MKP-1 KO\nmice had delayed cytokine mRNA degradation compared with\nWT macrophages.\n\nIt is well known that MKP-1 is a nuclear protein and it is imme-\ndiately induced in response to activated MAPKs. In the current\nstudy, we show that ectopically expressed MKP-1 is mainly in-\n\n\n\nFig. 8. AUF1 subcellular translocation post LPS stimulation in MKP-1 WT cells was associated with enhanced binding with IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 mRNAs. Primary bone\nmarrow macrophages were either harvested from MKP-1 KO or WT mice. Cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with 1 lg/ml of LPS (from Escherichia coli 0127:B8) for\n4 h. Protein A agarose beads coated with either anti-AUF1 or control normal rabbit serum were immunoprecipitated (IP) with cell lysates from bone marrow cells with or\nwithout LPS stimulation. RNA was extracted from IP products and RT-qPCR was performed. (a) IL-6 mRNA expression (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05) (b) TNF-a mRNA expression (n = 3,\n\u2044\u2044p < 0.01). (c) IL-10 mRNA expression. (n = 3, \u2044p < 0.05). IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10 mRNA were normalized to 10% input RNA endogenous beta-actin expression. The displayed\nresult is representative of three separate experiments.\n\n254 H. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255\nduced in the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation. Also, p-p38 and p-\nJNK are mainly induced in the cytoplasm in stimulated cells. These\nphenomena suggest that Ad.MKP-1 is preferentially retained in the\ncytoplasm or translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in re-\nsponse to LPS stimulation, where MKP-1 dephosphorylates acti-\nvated p-MAPKs. In contrast to p-p38 and p-JNK, p-ERK was\npresent in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although there\nwas increased MKP-1 protein expression in cells transduced with\nAd.MKP-1 at 2 and 4 h after LPS stimulation, p-ERK was less af-\nfected by MKP-1 compared with p-p38 and p-JNK. The results\nare consistent with findings by Chen et al. [29], supporting the idea\nthat MKP-1 plays a major role in dephosphorylation of activated\nJNK and p38 MAPK, but it only has minor effects on activated\nERK. Because ERK is primarily activated by hormone and growth\nfactors, it may have a minor role in stress stimuli.\n\nAUF1 is well characterized as a factor priming ARE-dependent\nmRNA decay [30\u201333]. Functionally, AUF1 differential splicing of\nAUF1 transcripts yields different mRNA, encoding four different\nisoforms: p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1. AUF1-deficient\nmice exhibit symptoms of severe endotoxic shock, including vascu-\nlar hemorrhage, intravascular coagulation, and high mortality after\nLPS stimulation as a result of decreased degradation of mRNA of\nTNF-a and IL-1b [34]. AUF1-deficient mice also develop chronic\ndermatitis with age that is characterized by pruritus and excoria-\ntions, which are associated with increased IL-2, TNF-a, and IL-1b\n[35]. Previous studies indicated that AUF1 could be phosphorylated\nat multiple sites, including serine and threonine [36\u201338]. Early\nstudies suggest AUF1 can also form a complex with other proteins,\nincluding phosphoproteins [32]. Because MKP-1 can dephosphory-\nlate serine/threonine residues, MKP-1 could act directly by dephos-\nphorylation of AUF1 or indirectly through dephosphorylation of\nother novel polypeptides associated with AUF1. Ongoing studies\nare focused on understanding the molecular nature of phosphory-\nlated forms of AUF1 and physical interactions with ARE-containing\ncytokine mRNAs.\n\nCritical to the present studies, other investigators have shown\nthat phosphorylation of AUF1 influences the ARE-binding affinity\ncapacity and the global structure of the AUF1\u2013ARE ribonucleopro-\ntein complexes [37]. Sirenko et al. [39] revealed that ARE-binding\nactivity and transcript stability were inversely regulated by phos-\nphorylation. They reported that both a tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ngenistein and a p38 MAPK inhibitor SK&F 86002 promoted assem-\nbly of AUF1\u2013ARE-dependent mRNA complex, and the degradation\nof those ARE-dependent mRNAs in human monocytes.\n\nIn this study, we show that AUF1 intracellular translocation is\ncorrelated with MKP-1 expression, thus cells with over-expression\nof MKP-1 demonstrated increased cytoplasmic accumulation of\nAUF1 p37AUF1, p40AUF1, p42AUF1 and p45AUF1 4 h after LPS stimula-\ntion compared with control groups of cells. Correspondingly, mac-\nrophages from MKP-1 WT mice displayed enhanced accumulation\nof AUF1 in the cytoplasm compared with cells from MKP-1 KO\nmice post LPS stimulus. The increased amount of cytoplasmic\n\n\n\nH. Yu et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 245\u2013255 255\nAUF1 in WT macrophages was associated with enhanced AUF1-\nassociated ARE-dependent mRNAs, and increased degradation of\nthose targeted cytokine mRNAs.\n\nIn a previous study by Brook et al. [40], dephosphorylation of\np38 MAPK by a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 or a combined\nMEK1/ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 with p38 MAPK inhibitor\nSB202190 caused a translocation of TTP from the cytoplasm to\nthe nucleus after LPS stimulation. However, in this study, TTP\ntranslocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was not observed\nin cells transduced with Ad.MKP-1, or in MKP-1 WT/KO mice stim-\nulated with LPS. This discrepancy may be attributed to the non-\nspecific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, which might affect other\nsignal pathways other than p38 MAPK pathway.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that MKP-1 is activated in\nresponse to stress stimuli, which specifically restrains the exagger-\nated MAPKs responses. MKP-1 specifically attenuates IL-6, TNF-a,\nIL-10 cytokine expressions and plays an essential role in maintain-\ning immune homeostasis. At the post-transcriptional level, MKP-1\nspecifically promotes AUF1 translocation from the nucleus to the\ncytoplasm in response to LPS stimulation, which facilitates the de-\ncay of mRNAs of IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10.\n\nDisclosures\n\nThe authors have no financial conflicts of interest.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis study is supported by grants from National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH): 1R01DE018290 (KL.K), 2P20 RR017696 (KL.K),\nR00DE018165 (V.P) and T32 DE017551 (H.Y).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Yang SH, Sharrocks AD, Whitmarsh AJ.

Both atrial natriuretic\npeptide (ANP) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1\ud835\udefc) exert cytoprotective effects. We tested the hypothesis that renal expression\nof ANP and HIF-1\ud835\udefc is involved in a mechanism responding to the oxidative stress produced in the kidneys of rats chronically fed a\nhigh sodium diet. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a normal salt (0.4%NaCl) (NS) or a high salt (8%NaCl) (HS) diet for 3 weeks,\nwith or without the administration of tempol (T), an inhibitor of oxidative stress, in the drinking water. We measured the mean\narterial pressure (MAP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urinary sodium excretion (UVNa). We evaluated the expression of\nANP, HIF-1\ud835\udefc, and transforming growth factor (TGF-\ud835\udefd1) in renal tissues by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The animals\nfed a high salt diet showed increased MAP and UVNa levels and enhanced renal immunostaining of ANP, HIF-1\ud835\udefc, and TGF-\ud835\udefd1.\nThe administration of tempol together with the sodium overload increased the natriuresis further and prevented the elevation of\nblood pressure and the increased expression of ANP, TGF-\ud835\udefd1, and HIF-1\ud835\udefc compared to their control. These findings suggest that\nHIF-1\ud835\udefc and ANP, synthesized by the kidney, are involved in an adaptive mechanism in response to a sodium overload to prevent\nor attenuate the deleterious effects of the oxidative stress and the hypoxia on the development of fibrosis.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated\nto play an important pathophysiological role in the kid-\nney [1\u20134]. ROS can activate the mitochondrial uncoupling\nprotein 2 (UCP-2), leading to inefficient renal O\n\n2\nusage\n\nand contributing to renal hypoxia [5]. Changes in cellular\noxygen concentrations induce tightly regulated response\npathways that attempt to restore oxygen supply to cells\nand modulate cell function in hypoxic conditions. Most of\n\nthese responses occur through the induction of the tran-\nscription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) which\ncoordinates the expression of diverse adaptive genes against\nthe hypoxic injury [6, 7]. HIF-1 transcriptionally upregulates\nthe expression of metabolic proteins (GLUT-1), adhesion\nproteins (integrins), soluble growth factors (TGF-\ud835\udefd and\nVEGF), and extracellularmatrix components (type I collagen\nand fibronectin), which enhance the repair process. For these\nreasons, HIF-1 is viewed as a positive regulator of organ repair\nand tissue fibrosis [8, 9].\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nBioMed Research International\nVolume 2014, Article ID 936978, 10 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/936978\n\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\nIn the kidney, a predominant enzyme involved in\noxidative stress development is NADPH-oxidase, which\nis upregulated by increased sodium tubular transport,\nluminal flow, or cytokines release [10, 11]. In turn, the\nsuperoxide anion increases tubular NaCl transport, fur-\nther enhancing oxidative stress [12]. It is well known that\na high salt intake increases the oxidative stress in the\nkidneys of normal and salt-sensitive rats [1\u20134]. In this\nregard, we have reported that a high salt diet in Sprague-\nDawley rats is able to increase the oxidative stress. We\nalso showed that the administration of tempol (4-hydroxy-\n2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl), which is a permeate\nsuperoxide dismutase mimetic commonly used to inhibit the\noxidative stress, prevented those changes and produced a\npotent natriuretic and diuretic effect. Thus, we concluded\nthat the increase of the oxidative stress induced by sodium\noverload could account for antinatriuresis [1]. It has also\nbeen described that, in models of experimental salt-sensitive\nhypertension, tempol improved the renal hemodynamic\nresponse and electrolyte excretory function, while abolish-\ning salt-sensitive hypertension and renal oxidative stress\n[13].\n\nA growing number of mammalian genes have been\nidentified to play a key role in the cellular adaptive response\nto counter-regulate the renal hypoxia and the consequent\nprocess of fibrosis, among which is atrial natriuretic peptide\n(ANP). ANP is a member of a natriuretic peptide family\nwhich, besides its role in the regulation of volume homeosta-\nsis, has been noted to exert protective effects in several cell\ntypes in response to oxidative stress [14] and fibrosis [15] and\non the adaptation to hypoxia [16].\n\nBased on these data, we hypothesized that endogenous\nrenal ANP andHIF-1\ud835\udefc could constitute endogenous adaptive\nmechanisms in response to the oxidative stress produced in\nthe kidney of rats chronically fed with a high sodium diet.\nTherefore, in the current study we determined the effect\nof a high-salt diet on the regulation of renal expression\nof HIF-1\ud835\udefc, ANP, and TGF-\ud835\udefd1 in Sprague-Dawley rats. In\naddition, we evaluated whether tempol administration, by\ninhibiting oxidative stress, prevents the increase of these\nmolecules. Understanding these endogenous mechanisms\ncan lead to finding a better therapeutic approach in salt-\nsensitive hypertension.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Animal Protocol and ExperimentalMeasurements. Exper-\niments were conducted in accordance with the care and use\nof research animals of international guiding principles and\nlocal regulations concerning the care and use of laboratory\nanimals for biomedical research (ANMAT, 6344/96; Institute\nof Laboratory Animal Resources, 1996) (14), as well as the\n\u201cInternational Ethical Guiding Principles for Biomedical\nResearch onAnimals\u201d established by theCIOMS (Council for\nInternational Organizations of Medical Sciences) (15). These\nprotocols were approved by Universidad de Buenos Aires\n(UBACYT B113) and the National Scientific and Technical\nResearch Council (CONICET, PIP 1337/09).\n\nMale Sprague Dawley rats, 5-6 weeks old (180\u2013200 g body\nweight), were used in the experiments. The animals were\nhoused in steel cages in a controlled temperature animal\nroom at 23 \u00b1 2\u2218C, exposed to a daily 12-hour light-dark\ncycle (light on from 07:00 a.m. to 07:00 p.m.), fed the diets\ndescribed below for three weeks, andwere given free access to\ntap water. The experiments were performed in rats randomly\ndivided into four groups (\ud835\udc5b = 6 for each group): (a) NS\n(control): fed a normal salt diet (0.4 g% NaCl); (b) HS:\nfed a high salt diet (8% g NaCl); (c) NS-T: fed a normal\nsalt diet (0.4 g% NaCl) plus 1mM tempol (Sigma-Aldrich\nInc, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), administered in the drinking\nwater; (d) HS-T: fed a high salt diet (8% g NaCl) plus 1mM\ntempol administered in the drinking water. After 3 weeks,\nthe rats were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with urethane\n(1.2 g\u22c5kg\u22121) and a PE-90 tube (3 cm long) was inserted into\nthe trachea to maintain an open airway. The left femoral vein\nwas catheterized with a Silastic cannula (0.12mm i.d.) for\ncontinuous infusion.The right carotid arterywas catheterized\nwith a T4 tube for blood sampling and for continuous mean\narterial pressure recording (MAP) by means of a Statham\nGOULD P23ID transducer coupled to a Grass Polygraph\n79D during all the procedures. The bladder was cannulated\nfor urine collection using a PE-75 cannula. A femoral vein\ninfusion with isotonic saline solution (ISS, 0.15M NaCl)\nwas performed at a rate of 0.04mL\u22c5min\u22121 (Syringe Infusion\nPump, Sage, Orion) for 60 minutes to allow for a steady\ndiuresis and to permit urine collection in all groups.Then, ISS\ninfusion continued for another 60min at the same rate during\nthe experimental period. From each animal, a blood sample\nwas collected at 30 minutes and a urine sample was collected\nfrom 0 to 60 minutes for sodium, potassium, and creatinine\nmeasurements. At the end of the experimental period, other\nblood samples were obtained from the abdominal cava vein,\nimmediately placed into plastic tubes containing 15% EDTA,\nand kept on ice for ANP dosage. The kidney was rapidly\nexcised, decapsulated, longitudinally cut, and harvested for\nimmunohistochemical studies.\n\n2.2. ANP Radioimmunoassay. The plasma ANP extraction\nprocedure was followed as described by Cavallero et al.\n[17]. The radioimmunoassay (RIA) was performed using\nan ANP-rat RIA commercial kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,\nBurlingame, CA) [18].\n\n2.3. Urine and Blood Measurements. Urinary and plasma\nsodium and creatinine were measured by standard methods\nusing an autoanalyzer. Creatinine clearance was assessed\nin order to evaluate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nGFR and sodium fractional excretion (FENa) were calculated\naccording to a standard formula. Urinary flow (UV) is\nexpressed as \ud835\udf07L\u22c5min\u22121, plasmatic sodium (PLNa) concen-\ntration as mEq\u22c5L\u22121, sodium urinary excretion (UVNa) as\n\ud835\udf07mol\u22c5min\u22121, GFR as mL\u22c5min\u22121, and FENa as percentage.\n\n2.4. Kidney Processing for Histological Examination. Renal\ntissues were fixed in phosphate-buffered 10% formaldehyde\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\n(pH 7.20) and embedded in paraffin. For immunohisto-\nchemistry, sections were deparaffinated and rehydrated, and\nendogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treatment\nwith 0.5% H\n\n2\nO\n2\nin methanol for 20 minutes. Local ANP,\n\nHIF-1\ud835\udefc, and TGF-\ud835\udefd1 were detected using the following\nspecific antibodies: rabbit anti-ANP (Phoenix Pharmaceuti-\ncal; dilution 1 : 500), rabbit anti-HIF-1\ud835\udefc (Novus Biologicals,\nInc., Littleton, CO; dilution 1 : 1000), and rabbit anti-TGF-\n\ud835\udefd1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; dilution 1 : 200). Immunos-\ntaining was performed with a commercial modified avidin-\nbiotin-peroxidase complex technique (Vectastain ABC kit,\nUniversal Elite, Vector Laboratories, CA) and with coun-\nterstaining with haematoxylin. Histological sections were\nobserved in a Nikon E400 light microscope (Nikon Instru-\nment Group, Melville, New York, USA). All measurements\nwere carried out using image analysis software (Image-Pro\nPlus ver. 4.5 for Windows, Media Cybernetics, LP. Silver\nSpring,MD,USA). Immunoreactivities for ANP, HIF-1\ud835\udefc, and\nTGF-\ud835\udefd1 are expressed as percentage of positive stained area\n\u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) in proximal convoluted\ntubules (PT), distal tubules (DT), thick ascending limb of the\nloop of Henle (THAL), cortical collecting ducts (CCD), and\nmedullary collecting ducts (MCD). Tissue samples of all the\nanimals were evaluated in a blinded fashion and separately by\ntwo researchers regarding knowledge of treatments.\n\n2.4.1. Preparation of RenalHomogenates forWestern Blot. The\nright kidney from all groups was extracted, dissected, and\nseparated. Tissue samples were homogenized on ice with\na Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products Inc.) in a buffer mix-\nture (50mmol\u22c5L\u22121 Tris, 0.1mmol\u22c5L\u22121 EDTA, 0.1mmol\u22c5L\u22121\nEGTA, 1% Triton, 1mmol\u22c5L\u22121 PMSF, 1 \ud835\udf07mol\u22c5L\u22121 pepstatin,\n2 \ud835\udf07mol\u22c5L\u22121 leupeptin, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail\n(Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentration in the Triton-\nsoluble supernatant was determined by the Lowry technique.\n\n2.4.2. Western Blot Analysis for HIF-1\ud835\udefc and ANP. Pooled\nsamples of renal tissue from five animals of each group and\ncontaining similar amounts of protein (150\ud835\udf07g protein/lane)\nwere separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS polyacry-\nlamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose\nmembrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with mouse polyclonal\nanti-ANP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. 1 : 800 dilution)\nor rabbit monoclonal-anti-HIF-1\ud835\udefc (Abcam; 1 : 1000 dilution).\nFor ANP, a secondary immune reaction followed with a\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugated with horseradish\nperoxidase (dilution of 1 : 10000). For HIF-1\ud835\udefc a secondary\nimmunereaction followed with a biotinylated anti-rabbit\n(dilution of 1 : 1000) and a 3rd antibody conjugated with\nhorseradish peroxidase (dilution of 1 : 1000). The samples\nwere revealed by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent\n(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2\u20134min. The density\nof the respective bands was quantified by densitometric\nscanning of Western blots using a Hewlett-Packard scanner\nandTotallab analyzer software (BiodynamicsCorp.). To avoid\ninaccuracies in protein loading, beta-tubulin was measured\nas internal standard (anti-beta tubulin, Ab 6046, rabbit\npolyclonal antibody) for each blot and protein levels were\n\ncalculated and expressed as the ratio between the optical\ndensities of the bands corresponding to ANP or HIF-1\ud835\udefc and\n\ud835\udefd-tubulin.\n\n2.5. Statistical Analysis. Results from urine and blood mea-\nsurements andMAP are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Gaussian\ndistribution was evaluated by the Kolmogorov and Smirnov\nmethod and the comparison among groups was carried out\nusing ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test. \ud835\udc43 values <\n0.05 were considered significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Body Weight and Mean Arterial Pressure. There were no\nsignificant differences in body weight between control and\nexperimental groups (grams; NS: 330 \u00b1 9; HS: 320 \u00b1 6; NS-\nT: 314 \u00b1 13; HS-T: 320 \u00b1 7).\n\nTheMAPwas increased in the HS fed group compared to\nthe NS-fed group (mmHg; NS: 94 \u00b1 3 versus HS: 107 \u00b1 3\u2217).\nTempol administration did not modify MAP levels in NS\nanimals but normalized MAP in the HS-T group, reaching\nMAP levels very similar to those observed inNS rats (mmHg;\nNS-T: 97 \u00b1 2 versus HS-T: 95 \u00b1 3\u2020) \u2217\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 versus\nrespective NS group, \u2020\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 versus respective group\nwithout tempol.\n\n3.2. Plasma Sodium and Urinary Sodium Excretion (Table 1).\nHigh salt diet and tempol administration did not alter plasma\nsodium in any experimental group.\n\nThe administration of a high salt diet did not alter\nthe GFR, which was increased by tempol in HS-T group\nwith respect to the HS group. Tempol administration also\nincreased GFR in the NS-T group as compared with the NS\ngroup.\n\nThe administration of a high salt diet led to a greater\nUVNa, which was further increased in HS-T group with\nrespect to the NS-T and HS groups. Moreover, tempol\nincreased UVNa in NS fed rats.\n\nThe administration of a high salt diet raised FENa in HS\ngroup with respect to the NS group. Tempol administration\nincreased the FENa further in the HS-T group as compared\nwith NS-T and to the HS group. FENa was not altered in the\nNS-T group.\n\n3.3. Plasmatic ANP. Plasma ANP concentration (pg\u22c5mL\u22121)\ndid not differ significantly between the NS (325.75 \u00b1 66.69)\nand HS (260.00 \u00b1 7.38) groups, as measured by RIA.\n\n3.4.

Repre-\nsentative images of ANP positive staining are shown in\nFigure 2(a) renal cortex and Figure 2(b) renal medulla.

Repre-\nsentative images of TGF-\ud835\udefd1 positive staining are shown in\nFigure 7 in (a) renal cortex and (b) renal medulla. Immunos-\ntaining analysis of renal sections revealed increased positive\nstaining for TGF-\ud835\udefd1 in glomeruli, THAL, CCD, and theMCD\nin HS group, with respect to the NS group. Tempol did not\nshow additional effects in the NS-T group as compared with\nits control and prevented the increase of TGF-\ud835\udefd1 staining in\nHS-T group.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur results showed that a high salt diet in normal rats resulted\nin a greater ANP expression in glomeruli, THAL and CCD,\nwhere the profibrotic marker TGF-\ud835\udefd1 was also increased.\nIn addition, enhanced HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression was observed not\nonly in the renal medulla as it has been previously described\n[19], but also in renal cortex. We found that tempol admin-\nistration, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, favored urinary\nsodium excretion, prevented the increase of ANP and TGF-\n\ud835\udefd1 expression, and normalized HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression, the latter\nexcept in THAL. Western blot analysis confirmed our data,\nshowing increased positive staining of HS group for ANP\nand HIF-1\ud835\udefd and decreased the expression of tempol groups\ncompared to their respective controls. These results suggest\nthat increased ANP and HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression in renal cortex\nand medulla could be involved in an adaptive response to the\noxidative stress resulting from a high salt diet.\n\nAs we have previously reported, a chronic salt overload\n(8% NaCl diet during 3 weeks) does not alter body weight\nor plasma sodium but causes higher MAP levels as well\nas urinary sodium excretion [1]. Even though the animals\nused in this study have their blood pressure taken under\nanesthesia, we have recently reported the same effect of a\nhigh salt diet on theMAP in conscious animals [20], allowing\nus to conclude that the anesthesia does not affect the blood\npressure when the different diet groups are compared. On the\n\nother hand, the administration of tempol normalized MAP\nlevels observed in the HS group, and it also increased further\nurinary sodium excretion. These results are in agreement\nwith previous studies, where treatmentwith tempol improved\nrenal hemodynamic and electrolyte excretory function in\nsalt-sensitive hypertension models [1, 21]. The effects of\ntempol, promoting natriuresis and preventing endogenous\nincrease of ANP, could suggest that, by inhibiting oxidative\nstress, tubular sodium transport decreases and thus prevents\nthe endogenous ANP expression as natriuretic hormone.\nHowever, we observed a clear raise in ANP expression\nalso in glomeruli from rats fed a high salt diet, in which\nsodium transport does not occur. Therefore, in addition to\na natriuretic effect, endogenous ANP could be exerting other\neffects in glomeruli and tubules. Furthermore, the increase\nof renal ANP levels coincided with TGF-\ud835\udefd1 over-expression\nin glomeruli, THAL and CCD. In this regard, it is known\nthat TGF-\ud835\udefd1 upregulates the transcription of the serum and\nglucocorticoid-dependent kinase hSGK1, involved in the reg-\nulation of two important factors for cell volume regulation,\nthat is, the renal epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and the thick\nascending limb Na+, K+, and 2Cl\u2212 cotransporter NKCC\n[22]. The increase of cell volume stimulates protein synthesis\nand inhibits protein degradation, contributing to enhancing\nthe net formation and deposition of matrix proteins. In\naddition, TGF-\ud835\udefd1 transduces intracellular signals through\ntype 1 (TGF-\ud835\udefdR1) and type 2 (TGF-\ud835\udefdR2) receptors, via the\nnuclear translocation of Smad3 proteins, thus contributing\nto a fibrotic response [23]. It has been demonstrated that\nthe activation of ANP/cGMP/PKG signaling phosphorylates\nSmad3 and disrupts TGF-\ud835\udefd1-induced nuclear translocation\nof pSmad3 and later downstream events, including myofi-\nbroblast transformation and the proliferation and expression\nof extracellular matrix molecules [24, 25]. Moreover, we\nhave previously demonstrated that an increase in TGF-\n\ud835\udefd1 expression produced by an acute saline overload was\nprevented and reversed by the administration of low and\nnonhypotensive doses of ANP [26]. Taking this into account,\n\n\n\n8 BioMed Research International\n\nFigure 6:Quantitative representation of positive intrarenal transforming growth factor (TGF-\ud835\udefd1) immunostaining/\ud835\udf07m2.

Several reports provide\nevidence that plasmatic ANP increases after a chronic salt\nloading given by drinking 1\u201318% NaCl solutions [27, 28]\nor by a rat chow with high salt content [29]. However, the\n\nliterature also shows conflicting results reporting that ANP\nmRNA expression and circulating levels of ANP remained\nunaltered after the ingestion of high sodium diets [30]. The\npresent results show that renal ANP expression levels are\nindependent of circulating ANP levels and are subjected to\na different regulation. These findings are in accordance with\nSun et al. who have previously demonstrated that a dietary\nsalt supplementation may selectively increase ANP levels in\nthe kidney by downregulating its clearance receptor (NPR-C)\n[31].\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 9\n\nNS HS\n\nNS-T HS-T\n\nG\n\nG\nG\n\nG\nG\n\nG\n\n(a)\n\nNS HS\n\nNS-T HS-T\n\nMCD\n\nMCD\n\nMCDMCD\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: (a) Representative images of positive staining of TGF-\ud835\udefd1 in renal cortex.

NS: normal salt diet group, HS: high salt diet group, NS-T: normal salt diet plus tempol group,\nHS-T: high salt diet plus tempol group, G: glomerulus, and MCD: medullary collecting duct.\n\nOur study also shows that a high salt intake increased\nHIF-1\ud835\udefc expressionnot only in the renalmedulla, as it has been\ndescribed before [18], but also in renal cortex. Considering\nthat a high salt intake increases oxidative stress, renal tubular\ntransport, and hypoxia, it may constitute one of the possible\nfactors involved in the upregulation of HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression in\nrenal tissues [6, 32]. Additionally, it has been reported that a\nhigh salt intake inhibits PHD-2 expression, the predominant\nisoform in renal medulla of prolyl-hydroxylase enzyme,\nwhich promotes the degradation of HIF-1\ud835\udefc, increasing its\nexpression level [33]. In this way, recent studies have shown\nthat HIF-1\ud835\udefc may regulate the encoding genes of some\nenzymes in the THAL, as those of nitric oxide synthase\n(NOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and hemeoxygenase-1\n(HO-1), which are highly expressed in renal medulla [34,\n35]. However, the tempol administration, which prevents\noxidative stress and enhanced urinary sodium excretion,\nnormalized HIF-1\ud835\udefc expression in the HS group, except in\nTHAL from both groups fed a normal or a high salt diet.\nThese data suggest that tempol could prevent the hypoxia\nproduced by the oxidative stress as it has been described\n[5, 20], but not the hypoxia produced by greater sodium\ntransport in THAL, where the enhancement of sodium\nreabsorption in this tubular segment may be compensat-\ning the inhibition of sodium transport in PT, elicited by\ntempol.\n\nIn summary, the present findings suggest that HIF-1\ud835\udefc\nand ANP could represent a main adaptive mechanism in\nnormal rats, in response to a salt overload, counter-regulating\nthe hypoxia and fibrosis produced by oxidative stress, and\nplaying a crucial role in the maintenance of sodium balance.\nThe administration of tempol, as a scavenger of superoxide\nanion, prevents overexpression of \ud835\udefc and ANP.The disruption\nof this salt adaptive pathway in salt-sensitive rats could be\nthe cause of sodium retention, oxidative stress, inflammation,\nand fibrosis in these animals. The pharmacological poten-\ntiation of endogenous ANP may be a therapeutic approach\nfor the management of oxidative stress in salt-sensitive\nhypertension.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThe authors do not have direct financial conflict of interests.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by Grants from the Consejo\nNacional de Investigaciones Cient\u0301\u0131ficas y Te\u0301cnicas (National\nCouncil for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina)\n(CONICET PIP 112-1337) and Universidad de Buenos Aires\n(UBACYT 2002010100688).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] M.

{"title": "Preventive effect of caffeine and curcumin on hepato_ carcinogenesis in diethylnitrosamine_induced rats", "warc_date": "20220328", "text": "INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  40:  1779-1788,  2012\n\nAbstract. Chemopreventive effects of caffeine and curcumin \nwere evaluated in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced \nhepatocarcinogenic rat model. Animals injected with DEN \nfor 10 weeks (G2-10w) and 14 weeks (G2-14w) were hepato-\ncarcinogenic rats. Animals injected with DEN and treated \nwith curcumin and caffeine for 10 weeks (G3-10w, G4-10w) \nand 14 weeks (G3-14w, G4-14w) were compared with those \nin G2. Macroscopic and microscopic features suggested that \ntreatment with caffeine, but not curcumin, for 10 and 14 weeks \nwas effective in inhibiting DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. \nImmunohistochemical and western blot analysis with proli-\nferating cell nuclear antigen and glutathione S-transferase-P \nantibodies also showed that expression levels of these hepato-\ncarcinogenic markers were more efficiently reduced by \ntreatment with caffeine than curcumin. Our data demonstrate \nthat caffeine could be a more potent compound than curcumin \nfor prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis in DEN-induced rats.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common \nmalignant tumors in the world, representing the third leading \ncause of death from cancer (1,2) and the fifth most prevalent \nmalignancy worldwide (3). Owing to advances in diagnostics \nand therapeutics, HCC can be curatively treated when detected \nat an early stage by applying therapies including radiofrequency \n\nablation (RFA), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization \n(TACE) and surgical resection. However, curative treat-\nments are often hampered by frequent recurrence of HCC (4) \nbecause the remaining liver retains the potential for de novo \ncarcinogenesis (5). Although systemic chemotherapy has also \nbeen challenged to patients with advanced stages of HCC, it is \nmostly ineffective (6). Although sorafenib, one of molecular \ntargeted therapies, has been introduced in the clinical field \nrecently (7), effective therapeutic compounds exactly targeting \nkey molecules involved in hepatocarcinogenesis have not been \ndiscovered yet.\n\nCurcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a natural yellow compound \nderived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa Linn. Curcumin, \ncommonly called turmeric, has been widely used as a spice \nand coloring agent in food such as curry. Recently, curcumin \nhas been demonstrated to possess a chemopreventive potential \nagainst a variety of cancers including skin (8), colorectal (9), \noral (10), stomach (11) and mammary glands (12). Although \nchemopreventive effects of curcumin against murine and rat \nhepatocellular carcinoma models have also been demonstrated \n(13-15), information on the mechanisms of curcumin's preven-\ntive effects against hepatocarcinogenesis is limited.\n\nCaffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a purine alkaloid \npresent in many popular beverages including cocoa, tea and \ncoffee, which may well be the most frequently ingested neuro-\nactive drug in the world (16). There is a growing body of evidence \nthat caffeine has beneficial effects on the liver. Consumption of \ncoffee was associated with a lower incidence of chronic liver \ndisease (17) and a reduced risk of HCC (18-23). Preventative \neffects of caffeine in rodent HCC models have been demon-\nstrated (24-26). However, the exact molecular mechanisms by \nwhich caffeine exerts beneficial effects on hepatocarcinogenesis \nare poorly defined.\n\nDiethylnitrosamine (DEN) is present in tobacco smoke, \nwater, cured and fried meals, agricultural chemicals, cosmetics \nand pharmaceutical agents (27). DEN is an established powerful \nhepatocarcinogen in rats possibly by altering the DNA structure, \nforming alkyl DNA adducts and inducing chromosomal aber-\nrations and micronuclei in the liver (28,29). Although a single \ninjection of DEN followed by partial hepatectomy coupled with \n2-acetyl-aminofluorene (2-AAF) is an established procedure \nfor developing HCC in rodents (30), sequential administration \nof DEN for several weeks has also been employed for inducing \nHCC (13,31).\n\nPreventive effect of caffeine and curcumin on hepato\u00ad\ncarcinogenesis in diethylnitrosamine\u00adinduced rats\n\nYUKI FUJISE,  JUN-ICHI OKANO,  TAKAKAZU NAGAHARA,  RYO ABE, \nRYU IMAMOTO  and  YOSHIKAZU MURAWAKI\n\nSecond Department of Internal Medicine, Tottori University School of Medicine, Tottori 683-8504, Japan\n\nReceived November 11, 2011;  Accepted December 30, 2011\n\nDOI: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1343\n\nCorrespondence to: Dr Jun-Ichi Okano, Second Department of \nInternal Medicine, Tottori University School of Medicine, 36-1 \nNishi-cho, Yonago, Tottori 683-8504, Japan\nE-mail: okanoj@hotmail.co.jp\n\nAbbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate \naminotransferase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; DEN, diethylnitros-\namine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; H&E, hematoxylin and \neosin; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HCV, hepatitis C virus; PBS, \nphosphate-buffered saline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; \nVEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor\n\nKey words: hepatocarcinogenesis, diethylnitrosamine, caffeine, \ncurcumin\n\n\n\nFUJISE et al:  EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE AND CURCUMIN ON DEN-INDUCED HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS1780\n\nIn the present study, we sought to determine whether \ncurcumin and caffeine had a potential to prevent DEN-induced \nhepatocarcinogenesis in Wistar rats.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nChemicals. Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and curcumin \n(diferuloylmethane) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical \nIndustries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Pentobarbital was purchased \nfrom Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). \nDEN and an anti-\u03b2-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma \nAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Antibodies against proliferating \ncell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and glutathione S-transferase \n(GST)-P were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. \n(Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI, \nUSA), respectively. Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horse-\nradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies for western blot analysis \nwere obtained from GE Healthcare, Ltd. (Buckinghamshire, \nUK). All other chemicals and solvents used in this study were \nof analytical grade.\n\nAnimals, treatments and tissue collection. Male Wistar \nrats weighing ~200 g were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. \n(Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan). All animals received humane \ncare and protocols were approved by the Tottori University \nAnimal Ethics Committee. The animals were randomized, \ndivided into eight groups (Fig. 1) and housed two per cage with \nrice husks for bedding in an air-ventilated room under a 12-h \nlight/dark cycle with constant temperature (22\u02daC) and humidity \n(55%). The animals were allowed free access to food and tap \nwater ad libitum during the experiment. Animals in group 1 \n(G1) were intraperitoneally injected with 300 \u00b5l of phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) weekly for 10 weeks (G1-10w, n=2) and \n14 weeks (G1-14w, n=2). Animals in group 2 (G2), group 3 (G3) \nand group 4 (G4) were intraperitoneally injected with DEN \n(40 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in PBS weekly for 10 weeks \n(G2-10w, G3-10w, G4-10w; n=6 in each group) and 14 weeks \n(G2-14w, G3-14w, G4-14w; n=6 in each group). In G3-10w and \nG3-14w, the rats were fed with 0.25% curcumin in powder form \nfor 10 and 14 weeks, respectively. In G4-10w and G4-14w, the \nrats were given drinking water containing 0.02% caffeine for \n10 and 14 weeks, respectively. Body weights, food consumption \nand water intake were monitored weekly throughout the experi-\nmental period. One week after 10- and 14-week treatments, \nanimals were sacrificed under anesthesia by pentobarbital. \nBlood samples were withdrawn via cardiac puncture and serum \nsamples were stored at -30\u02daC until analysis. Immediately after \nthe livers were excised, they were divided into two sections for \nhistological examination in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and \nfor protein studies at -80\u02daC.\n\nMeasurement of serum transaminase. Serum aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \nlevels were measured at SRL, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nTotal protein preparation and western blotting. The liver \nsamples were mashed with BioMasher (Nippi, Inc., Tokyo, \nJapan) and lysed in radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer \n(Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA) supplemented with \n1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \n\nfluoride (PMSF) and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche \nDiagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for 10 min on ice. Total protein \nsamples (5 \u00b5g) were separated on a sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS)-\npolyacrylamide gel (PAGE) (SuperSep, Wako Pure Chemical \nIndustries, Ltd.) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride \n(PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). After \nthe membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk (Santa Cruz \nBiotechnology, Inc.) in TBST (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, \npH 8.0 and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, they \nwere probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u02daC, washed \nthree times in TBST and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-\nrabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody in TBST for 1 h \nat room temperature. After the signals were developed with \na chemiluminescence solution (ECL, GE Healthcare, Ltd.), \n\nFigure 1. Experimental schedules. Experimental schedules of the G1-G4 groups \nare demonstrated. (A) Animals in group 1 (G1-10w) were intraperitoneally \ninjected with 300 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) weekly for 10 weeks \n(n=2). Animals in group 2 (G2-10w), group 3 (G3-10w) and group 4 (G4-10w) \nwere intraperitoneally injected with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (40 mg/kg \nbody weight) in PBS weekly for 10 weeks (n=6 in each group). The rats in \nG3-10w were fed with 0.25% curcumin for 10 weeks. The rats in G4-10w were \ngiven drinking water containing 0.02% caffeine for 10 weeks. The rats were \nsacrificed one week after the last treatment. (B) Animals in group 1 (G1-14w) \nwere intraperitoneally injected with 300 \u00b5l of PBS weekly for 14 weeks \n(n=2).

The rat liver tissues were \nfixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. \nFor histologic analysis, serial sections (5 \u00b5m) were stained with \nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Neoplastic nodules and HCC \nwere classified on the basis of the published criteria (32). For \nimmunohistochemistry with the PCNA and GST-P antibodies, \nHistofine\u00ae Simple Stain Rat MAX PO was employed (Nichirei \nBiosciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, after routine dewaxing \n\nwith xylene and hydration through a graded ethanol series, the \nsections were incubated with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide solution \nfor 15 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxi-\ndase activity. The sections were washed in PBS, blocked with \n1.5% serum solution and incubated with primary antibodies \novernight at 4\u02daC. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were \nincubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min at \nroom temperature and horse HRP-conjugated ABC solution \n(Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) was applied \nfor 30 min at room temperature. The peroxidase activity \nwas developed with DAB solution (Vector Laboratories, \n\nFigure 2. Relative liver weight and serum transaminase levels.

Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. The \nPCNA labeling indices were represented as the percentage \nof positively stained nuclei by counting 1000 cells in field at \nmagnification x200. The GST-P-positive area was measured on \nimages captured by a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera \non a Windows\u00ae computer.\n\nStatistical analysis. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. \nValues between two groups were compared using the Mann-\nWhitney U-test. Statistical significance was inferred at P<0.05.\n\nResults\n\nRelative liver weight and serum transaminase levels. All rats \nsurvived throughout the experimental period. Relative liver \nweight (liver weight/body weight) was significantly higher in G2 \nthan G1 at both 10 and 14 weeks, presumably due to the develop-\nment of liver tumors (Fig. 2A). Relative liver weight demonstrated \na trend to be decreased by treatment with curcumin (G3) and \ncaffeine (G4) for 10 and 14 weeks, although this reduction did \nnot reach a statistically significant difference (Fig. 2A).\n\nSerum transaminase levels (AST and ALT) were signifi-\ncantly higher in G2 than G1 at both 10 and 14 weeks, probably \nreflecting hepatic injury induced by DEN (Fig. 2B). Although \ntreatment with curcumin (G3) and caffeine (G4) for 10 weeks \ndid not significantly inhibit the DEN-induced elevation of serum \ntransaminase levels, AST was significantly suppressed by the \ntreatment with curcumin (G3) and caffeine (G4) for 14 weeks \n(Fig. 2B). These data imply a promising result that curcumin \nand caffeine may have some preventive effects on DEN-induced \nhepatitis and hepatocarcinogenesis.\n\nMacroscopic and histological examinations. Macroscopic and \nmicroscopic features of the liver in the four treatment groups \nwere examined after 10 and 14 weeks. In the control rats \n\n(G1-10w, G1-14w), no tumors were observed (Figs. 3A and 4A) \nand the liver histology showed normal appearance (Figs. 3B \nand 4B). In the DEN-treated rats for 10 weeks (G2-10w, \nG3-10w and G4-10w), white small nodules were macroscopi-\ncally observed (Fig. 3A). In histological analysis, hyperplastic \nnodules were developed in G2-10w, G3-10w and G4-10w, \nrevealing no significant difference in the number of nodules \namong these three groups (Fig. 3B). In the DEN-treated rats \nfor 14 weeks (G2-14w, G3-14w and G4-14w), the number and \nsize of white nodules were obviously enhanced compared \nto those at 10 weeks (Fig. 4A). Gross appearance of G2-14w \nand G3-14w was mostly identical. However, the number and \nsize of white nodules in G4-14w were significantly decreased \ncompared to those of G2-14w and G3-14w. White nodules at \n14 weeks were histologically proven to be HCC in G2-14w \nand G3-14w (Fig. 4B). Concordant with macroscopic findings, \nHCC area was significantly smaller in G4-14w than G2-14w \nand G3-14w (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that caffeine, but \nnot curcumin, may have preventive effects on DEN-induced \nhepatocarcinogenesis.\n\nExpression levels of PCNA. PCNA is an essential regulator of \nthe cell cycle, whose expression has been a useful tool to study \ncell proliferation including the liver (33). We compared the \nexpression levels of PCNA in the liver among the four treat-\nment groups. As expected, immunohistochemical analysis \nrevealed that PCNA-positive cells were scarcely observed \nin the control liver at 10 and 14 weeks (G1-10w and G1-14w) \n(Figs. 5A and 6A). After the treatment with DEN for 10 weeks, \nPCNA-positive cells were significantly increased (G2-10w). \nAlthough the number of PCNA-positive cells was not signi-\nficantly modulated after the treatment with curcumin for \n10 weeks (G3-10w), it was significantly suppressed after the \ntreatment with caffeine for 10 weeks (G4-10w) compared to \nG2-10w (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis mostly recapitulated \n\nFigure 3. Macroscopic and microscopic features of the liver at 10 weeks.

(A) Macroscopic features of the liver from control rats (G1-10w), DEN-treated rats (G2-10w), DEN-treated rats administered with \ncurcumin (G3-10w) and DEN-treated rats administered with caffeine (G4-10w) for 10 weeks are demonstrated. Arrows indicate the representative nodules. (B) \nHistological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that hyperplastic nodules (arrows) were developed in G2-10w, G3-10w and G4-10w.

Whitish nodules developed on the liver surface of G2-14w, \nG3-14w and G4-14w. (B) Histological analysis revealed white nodules observed in G2-14w and G3-14w were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were evalu-\nated in the liver at 10 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis (A) and western blot analysis (B). (A) Expression levels of PCNA in the liver were evaluated \nin the control (G1-10w), after treated with DEN (G2-10w), after treated with DEN combined with curcumin (G3-10w) and after treated with DEN combined \nwith caffeine (G4-10w) at 10 weeks. Arrows indicate representative PCNA-positive nuclei. Percentages of PCNA-positive cells in G1-10w, G2-10w, G3-10w \nand G4-10w are 0, 17.0, 20.5 and 10.6%, respectively. Original magnification, x200. (B) Representative liver samples from four treatment groups (G1-10w, \nG2-10w, G3-10w and G4-10w) were probed with anti-PCNA antibody (top lane).

When the rats were treated with \nDEN for 14 weeks, the number of PCNA-positive nuclei was \nenhanced compared to that for 10 weeks, which was concordant \nwith above-described macroscopic and microscopic features \n(Fig. 6A, G2-14w). It is interesting to note that treatment with \ncurcumin (G3-14w) and caffeine (G4-14w) significantly inhi-\nbited the expression of PCNA in the DEN-treated liver sections \n(Fig. 6A). This finding was confirmed by western blot analysis \n(Fig. 6B). These results imply that curcumin and caffeine may \nbe effective for preventing DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis \nin rats and caffeine appears to be a more potent compound than \ncurcumin.\n\nExpression levels of GST-P. Among glutathione S-transferases \n(GSTs), a family of detoxification enzymes catalyzing the \nconjugation of glutathione with a large number of carcinogens, \n\nplacental GST (GST-P) is specifically expressed during rat \nhepatocarcinogenesis, and has been used as a reliable tumor \nmarker for experimental hepatocarcinogenesis in rats (34). \nWe therefore examined the expression levels of GST-P in the \nfour treatment groups at 10 and 14 weeks. As expected, GST-P \nwas not expressed in the control liver samples (G1-10w and \nG1-14w) by either immunohistochemical (Figs. 7A and 8A) or \nwestern blot analysis (Figs. 7B and 8B). The GST-P-positive \narea appeared in the DEN-treated liver at 10 weeks (G2-10w, \nFig. 7A), which became more evident at 14 weeks (G2-14w, \nFig. 8A). Western blot analysis confirmed induction of GST-P by \nthe treatment with DEN for 10 and 14 weeks (Figs. 7B and 8B). \nExpression levels of GST-P were not significantly modified by \nthe treatment with curcumin for 10 weeks (G3-10w) compared to \nG2-10w (Fig. 7A). It was observed that GST-P-positive area was \nsignificantly reduced by the treatment with caffeine for 10 weeks \n(G4-10w) compared to that of G2-10w (Fig. 7A). Western blot \nanalysis mostly recapitulated these effects of curcumin and \ncaffeine on the GST-P expression (Fig. 7B).\n\nFinally, effects of curcumin and caffeine were evaluated \nafter 14 weeks of the treatment. Treatment with curcumin for \n\nFigure 6. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the liver at 14 weeks. Expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were evalu-\nated in the liver at 14 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis (A) and western blot analysis (B). (A) Expression levels of PCNA in the liver were evaluated \nin the control (G1-14w), after treated with DEN (G2-14w), after treated with DEN combined with curcumin (G3-14w) and after treated with DEN combined \nwith caffeine (G4-14w) at 14 weeks. Arrows indicate representative PCNA-positive nuclei. Percentages of PCNA-positive cells in G1-14w, G2-14w, G3-14w \nand G4-14w are 0.7, 34.6, 24.0 and 17.3%, respectively. Original magnification, x200. (B) Representative liver samples from four treatment groups (G1-14w, \nG2-14w, G3-14w and G4-14w) were probed with anti-PCNA antibody (top lane).

However, treat-\nment with caffeine for 14 weeks was able to inhibit the GST-P \nexpression induced by DEN (Fig. 8). These results suggest again \nthat caffeine could be a more potent compound than curcumin \nfor prevention of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSince the vast majority of HCC is complicated with chronic liver \ndiseases including chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis associ-\nated with infection with HBV and HCV, regular surveillance \nof patients who are at high risk of HCC by ultrasonography and \ncomputed tomography (CT) has been proposed in Japan for \nearly detection of HCC (35). Despite the surveillance program, \nHCC is often diagnosed at advanced stages and the prognosis \nof patients with HCC is still unsatis factory. Therefore, effec-\ntive chemopreventive remedy for patients at high risk of HCC \nis awaited to improve the prognosis of patients with chronic \nliver diseases.\n\nCancer chemoprevention is defined as the use of specific \nnatural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse or suppress \ncarcinogenesis and prevent the development of invasive cancer \nby using physiological pathways (36). Phytochemicals, which \nare plant-derived chemicals contained in fruits, vegetables \nand grains, have recently been drawn much attention due to \nanti-tumor activity against a variety of cancers including HCC \n(37). Possible compounds with a potential of chemopreventive \neffects on the liver include caffeine, capsaicin, cinnamaldehyde, \ncurcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, \nsilymarin and sulforaphane (SFN) (38).\n\nCaffeine is the world's most frequently ingested beverage \nwith approximately 80% consumed in the form of coffee (39). \nThere is a growing body of evidence that caffeine has benefi-\ncial effects on the liver. For example, consumption of coffee \nwas associated with a lower incidence of chronic liver disease \n(17) and a reduced risk of HCC (19,22). Although preventa-\ntive effects of caffeine in rodent HCC models have been \ndemonstrated (24,25), exact molecular mechanisms by which \ncaffeine exerts beneficial effects on hepatocarcinogenesis are \npoorly defined except cell cycle arrest (16,40) and induction \n\nFigure 7.

Although chemopreventive \neffects of curcumin against murine and rat HCC models have \nbeen demonstrated (13-15), information on the mechanisms of \ncurcumin's preventive effects against HCC is limited except \nanti-angiogenetic property by suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 \n(COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (45), \ninhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (46) and \ninduction of apoptosis (44).\n\nIn the present study, we sought to evaluate whether caffeine \nand curcumin would show benefit in DEN-induced HCC model \nin Wistar rats. We determined the concentration of curcumin \nas 0.25% based on previous studies (13,14) and because when \n\nwe tested administration of 0.5 and 1% curcumin, food intake \nand body weight gain were poor (data not shown). Treatment \nwith 0.25% curcumin for 14 weeks demonstrated week \ninhibitory effects on DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis \nwhen judged from decreased serum AST levels and hepatic \nexpression levels of PCNA. However, the beneficial effects \nof curcumin were marginal. One of the reasons in our study \nmay derive from a low bioavailability of curcumin after oral \nadministration as reported in patients with colorectal cancer \n(47). To achieve high serum and tissue curcumin levels which \nare enough to exert anti-cancer effects, new curcumin delivery \nplatforms such as liposome-encapsulated curcumin (48) have \nto be developed for improving the curcumin bioavailability \nand anticancer potential.\n\nThe concentration of caffeine was determined based on \nprevious studies employing 0.02-0.2% (25,49) and because \nwhen we administered 0.05 and 0.1% caffeine in drinking \nwater in our preliminary studies, water consumption and body \nweight gain were poor (data not shown). Treatment with 0.02% \n\nFigure 8. Expression of glutathione S-transferase-P in the liver at 14 weeks.

These results suggest that caffeine could be a useful \nphytochemical for prevention of HCC.\n\nUnfortunately, we did not examine the molecular mecha-\nnisms by which caffeine and curcumin exhibited anti-cancer \neffects in the DEN-induced HCC model. In our previous in vitro \nstudy, we clarified that caffeine activated the mitogen-activated \nERK-regulating kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated \nkinase (ERK) pathway that resulted in the downstream upregu-\nlation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in HCC \ncells (40). Further investigation of signaling molecules involved \nin anti-cancer effects by caffeine and curcumin in vivo will be \nnecessary.\n\nIn summary, caffeine could be a more potent compound \nthan curcumin for prevention of DEN-induced hepatocarcino-\ngenesis in rats. The doses of these compounds which effectively \ndemonstrate chemopreventive effects without toxicity need to \nbe examined in patients with chronic liver diseases in future \nclinical studies.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Mr. Yujirou Ikuta for his technical \nassistance.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

Reports have shown that activation of inflammatory cascades play an important\nrole in the development and persistence of neuropathic pain states, but it is not well established in pain-\nful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Previously, studies have shown increased inflammatory cytokines in the\nserum of the diabetic patients with painful neuropathy. This study focuses on the changes in the levels of\ninflammatory mediators such as TNFa, interleukins, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules with the\ndevelopment of pain in the DRG of the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, an established model for T2D. This\nstudy also demonstrates an alteration in the levels of voltage gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) with the\ndevelopment of pain in DRG of the ZDF rats.\nResults: Pre-diabetic ZDF animals at 8\u20139 weeks of age showed no thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia\ncompared to their respective lean controls. Diabetic-ZDF animals tested for pain related behaviors\nshowed significant thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia at 4 and 6 weeks after the onset of diabetes\nwhen compared with their age matched lean controls. These ZDF animals with PDN also showed changes\nin a large number of inflammatory mediators in the DRG as assessed by Western blot as well as by cyto-\nkine antibody array compared to their age matched lean controls. Further analysis by Rat cytokine anti-\nbody array of DRG of the ZDF animals with PDN at 6 weeks after diabetes when compared with ZDF\nanimals with no pain revealed an elevation of a significant number of inflammatory mediators including,\nthe pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, interleukin-1, 6, 13 and 17, chemokines such as MIP1 and\n3, RANTES, Fractalkine and cell adhesion molecule sICAM that are associated with pain phenotype. The\nZDF animals with PDN also demonstrated an increase in the protein levels of voltage gated sodium chan-\nnel NaV1.7 in DRG compared to lean controls with no pain.\nConclusions: The rise in inflammatory markers in the DRG of Type 2 diabetic animals and increases in\nvoltage gated sodium channel NaV1.7 in DRG with the onset of pain in PDN suggest that inflammation\nin the DRG may play an important role in the development of pain in this model.\n\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nRA\nCT\n\nE\n\n1. Introduction\n\nDiabetes mellitus is the most common cause of neuropathy in\nthe United States and pain is a significant complication of diabetic\nneuropathy occurring in 20\u201325% of patients with neuropathy and\nresulting in a significant adverse effect on quality of life measures\n\nR\n [1]. Unfortunately, available medical treatment is relativelyineffective with limited efficacy and often complicated by side ef-fects and dependency [2,3]. The etiology of pain in diabetic neurop-athy is not well understood. Accumulating evidence suggests thatthe activation of inflammatory cascades in the peripheral and cen-\ntral nervous system may play a role in the development and persis-\ntence of neuropathic pain states induced by physical or toxic injury\nto peripheral nerve [4,5].\n\nIn diabetes there is evidence of systemic immune activation. Pa-\ntients with painful neuropathy have increased IL-2 and TNFa\nmRNA and protein levels in blood [4]. Type 1 diabetes patients\nhave increased serum TNFa [6] and studies on patients with\ndiabetic painful neuropathy exhibit a different serum immune\nprofile compared to patients with painless diabetic neuropathy,\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009&domain=pdf\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009\nmailto:munmunc@umich.edu\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.04.009\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine\n\n\n2 C. Galloway, M. Chattopadhyay / Cytokine 63 (2013) 1\u20135\nsuggesting that immune markers in blood are associated with dia-\nbetic neuropathic pain [7]. But, the relationship of these serum\ninflammatory markers to nociceptive pathways in the nervous sys-\ntem has not been explored. We undertook these studies to evaluate\nthe role of inflammatory mediators in DRG in T2D model of PDN.\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Study design and behavioral test\n\nThe Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF, Charles River, USA) rat, a sub-\nstrain of the obese Zucker rat, is an established model for Type 2\ndiabetes in which hyperglycemia initially manifests at about 8\u2013\n9 weeks of age. A blinded researcher assessed thermal hyperalgesia\nby measuring the latency to hind paw withdrawal from a thermal\nstimulus determined by exposing the plantar surface of the hind\npaw to radiant heat using a modified Hargreaves thermal testing\ndevice. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed using an analgesim-\neter (Ugo-Basile, Comerio, VA, Italy) by the Randall and Selitto paw\npressure method as described previously [8].\nA\n\n2.2. Cytokine array and Western blot\n\nRat Cytokine Array (ARY008; R&D Systems, USA) was used to\nsimultaneously detect the relative expression of 29 cytokines, che-\nmokines and cell adhesion molecules. This antibody array detects\nmultiple analytes in tissue lysates. L4\u2013L6 DRG from rats (n = 5)\nwere homogenized and prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. The sample protein concentrations were measured\nusing a total protein assay [8]. Once the membranes were blocked,\n15 lL of reconstituted detection antibody cocktail were added to\neach prepared sample. The samples with antibody cocktail were\nthen added to the membrane and incubated at room temperature\nfor 1 h. The membranes were washed, followed by incubation with\nStreptavidin-HRP for 30 min. The intensity of each spot was deter-\nmined by quantitative chemiluminescence, using a PC-based im-\nage analysis system (ChemiDoc XRS System, Bio-Rad\nLaboratories, USA); and pixel densities were quantitated by analyz-\ning the array image file using image analysis software (Quanti-one\n4.6.1; Bio-rad Laboratories, USA). For western blot, L4\u2013L6 DRG\nfrom each animal considered as one sample (n = 5) were homoge-\nnized and prepared as described previously [8].\n\nR\n\n2.3. DRG culture experiment\n\nFor in vitro studies, adult rats were anaesthetized with chloral\nhydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.). DRG from these rats were collected and\ndissociated following 0.25% collagenase treatment for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC\nwith 0.25% trypsin, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)\nfor 30 min at 37 \ufffdC with constant shaking and then plated on Lam-\ninin, poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips at 105 cells per well in a 24-\nwell plate in 500 ll of defined neurobasal media containing B27,\nGlutamax I, Albumax II and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco-BRL,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 100 ng/ml of 7.0S NGF\nper ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). 4 day old DRG neurons in cul-\nture were incubated with 15 ng/ml of recombinant TNFa (rTNFa,\nSigma) for overnight and collected for qRT-PCR and western blot\nanalysis for NaV1.7 level in DRG (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nRE\nT\n\n2.4. Statistical analysis\n\nThe statistical significance of the difference between groups\nwas determined by ANOVA (Systat 11) using Bonferroni\u2019s\ncorrection for the multiple post hoc analyses. All results are ex-\npressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. ZDF rats with Type 2 model of diabetes showed thermal\nhyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia 6 weeks after diabetes\n\nPre-diabetic animals at 8\u20139 weeks of age showed normal re-\nsponses similar to their age-matched lean controls (Fig. 1a). At\n2 weeks after diabetes, ZDF animals showed only significant de-\ncrease in thermal latency (Fig. 1b; lean 14.93 \u00b1 2.2 s; ZDF\n10.67 \u00b1 1.8 s; P < 0.01) but no significant difference in mechanical\nhyperalgesia compared to the lean controls. At 4 weeks (lean\n13.16 \u00b1 0.6 s; ZDF 10.18 \u00b1 0.9 s; P < 0.005 at 6 weeks) and 6 weeks\nafter the onset of diabetes, the ZDF animals showed significant de-\ncrease in thermal latency (lean 12.93 \u00b1 1.2 s; ZDF 8.47 \u00b1 1.7 s;\nP < 0.005 at 6 weeks) and substantial decrease in paw withdrawal\nthreshold measured by Randall-Selitto method at 4 weeks (lean\n78.5 \u00b1 1.9 gm; ZDF 54.50 \u00b1 2.5 gm; P < 0.005) and 6 weeks (lean\n89.64 \u00b1 8.2 gm; ZDF 59.53 \u00b1 5.7 gm; P < 0.005; Fig. 1c and d) after\nthe onset of diabetes.\n\n3.2. ZDF animals with pain-related behavior exhibited increased\nNaV1.7 in DRG\n\nIn previous studies we and others have found that there is an\nincrease in the amount of voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7\n(NaV1.7) in DRG of STZ-diabetic (a model of T1D) animals with\nPDN [8]. In this study, DRG were analyzed for expression of voltage\ngated sodium channel isoform NaV1.7 by Western blot to correlate\nthe changes in NaV1.7 with the changes in pain-related behaviors.\nWe did not find any increase in the level of NaV1.7 in 8 weeks old\npre-diabetic ZDF animals without PDN (Fig. 1a and e). 2 weeks\nafter diabetes, ZDF animals showed significant increase in thermal\nhyperalgesia (P<0.01) but not mechanical hyperalgesia and a mod-\nerate increase in NaV1.7 (Fig. 1b and f). At 4 and 6 weeks after dia-\nbetes, ZDF animals showed significant thermal and mechanical\nhyperalgesia along with a substantial increase in NaV1.7 levels in\nDRG (Fig. 1c, d and g, h).\n\n3.3. ZDF rats with painful diabetic neuropathy demonstrated increased\nneuroinflammation in DRG\n\nPre-diabetic ZDF animals showed no significant change in the\nexpression of any of the 29 pro-inflammatory cytokines or chemo-\nkines in DRG at 8 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 2) compared to\ntheir age-matched lean controls. ZDF animals with PDN 6 weeks\nafter diabetes when compared with their respective age-matched\nlean control animals showed a significant increase in 27 out of\n29 cytokine/chemokines/cell adhesion molecules; only 2 cytokines,\nIL-10 and IL-4, those have anti-inflammatory properties, did not\nchange in these animals (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nBy Western blot of DRG, we found that ZDF animals at 6 weeks\nof diabetes exhibited significant increases in a number of inflam-\nmatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), inter-\nleukin-1 b (IL1b) and phospho-p38 MAPK protein compared to\nlean control animals (Fig. 2a\u2013c).

These\ncytokines have also been implicated in the development of hyper-\nsensitivity or pain in other models of neuropathic pain caused by\nphysical injury which are important for the regulation of immune\nresponses and nociception [5]. Members of the CC and CXC family\nof chemokines that are significantly increased compared to pre-\ndiabetic ZDF animals without pain include CCL3 (MIP-1a) and\nCCL20 (MIP-3a) [9], CCL5 and CXCL10 (RANTES and IP-10) [10],\nCXCL7 (thymus cytokine) and CX3CL1 (Fractalkine), which are\nincreased in other models of neuropathic pain resulting from phys-\nical injury to nerve and are implicated in behavioral hypersensitiv-\nity and vascular inflammation [11]. Cell adhesion molecule\nsICAM-1 that represents important biomarker for inflammatory\nprocesses [7] was also increased in ZDF animals with PDN. In\nrecent past trophic factors have been implicated with pain in pa-\ntients. Trophic factors, including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)\nwhich has been associated with hyperalgesia in ALS patients in a\nphase I trial, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF) which was linked with severity of pain in patients\nwith bladder pain [12,13], were also elevated in ZDF animals with\nPDN in this study.\n\nTo date, research focused on improving the treatment of chronic\npain has largely ignored the role of inflammation-associated fac-\ntors in nociceptive pathways in the peripheral nervous system in\ndiabetic subjects. In these studies, we found that a number of cyto-\nkines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules are altered in T2D\nanimals with PDN. Similar to our previous STZ-diabetic studies,\nthese studies also documented that ZDF animals with pain demon-\nstrate increased NaV1.7 levels in DRG. In recent studies it has been\nshown that elevated levels of TNF-a are responsible for the up-reg-\nulation of voltage gated sodium channel activity [14]. We found\n\nRE\nTR\nthat the adult DRG neurons in culture when pre-incubated with\n15 ng/ml of recombinant TNFa (rTNFa) for overnight, to determine\nwhether the increase in proinflammatory cytokines would change\nthe level of NaV1.7 in the neurons, showed an increase in NaV1.7\nprotein and mRNA levels compared to control cells. This prelimin-\nary study suggests that TNFa plays an essential role in modulation\nof voltage gated sodium channel (Supplementary Fig. 3). We have\nshown that ZDF animals with PDN starting at 2 weeks had a small\nincrease in the levels of NaV1.7 compared to no change in the pre-\ndiabetic ZDF animals without any pain. At 4 and 6 weeks after the\nonset of diabetes, DRG of the animals had significant increase in\nthe levels of NaV1.7. These animals at 6 weeks of diabetes also\nshowed an increased phosphorylation of p-38 in DRG along with\nsimultaneous changes in a number of proinflammatory cytokines\nand chemokines as stated above. Hence, the results from this study\nmay suggest that the elevation of these inflammatory mediators in\nDRG may be responsible for the development of painful neuropa-\nthy in Type 2 diabetes, which may be associated with increases\nin the voltage gated sodium channel NaV1.7. Therefore, the painful\ndiabetic neuropathy may possibly be considered, at least in part, a\n\u2018neuro-inflammatory\u2019 condition. Taken together, a better under-\nstanding of the role of these pro-nociceptive markers may lead to\nthe development of novel analgesic targets.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work has funded by Pilot and Feasibility Grant from the\nMichigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (Award Number\nR000617 to MC, from the NIDDK Grant 5P60-DK020572) and\nAmerican Diabetes Association (Grant #7-12-BS-021).

Singh,1 Cheng Luo,2,3 Ronen Marmorstein,2\nTomasz Kordula,1 Sheldon Milstien,4 Sarah Spiegel1*\n\nThe pleiotropic lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) can act intracellularly\nindependently of its cell surface receptors through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine kinase 2\n(SphK2), one of the isoenzymes that generates S1P, was associated with histone H3 and produced\nS1P that regulated histone acetylation. S1P specifically bound to the histone deacetylases\nHDAC1 and HDAC2 and inhibited their enzymatic activity, preventing the removal of acetyl\ngroups from lysine residues within histone tails. SphK2 associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in\nrepressor complexes and was selectively enriched at the promoters of the genes encoding the\ncyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 or the transcriptional regulator c-fos, where it enhanced\nlocal histone H3 acetylation and transcription. Thus, HDACs are direct intracellular targets of\nS1P and link nuclear S1P to epigenetic regulation of gene expression.\n\nPhospholipid and sphingolipid metaboliteshave established roles in signal transduc-tion pathways initiated by activation of cell\nsurface receptors. The recent identification of\nnuclear lipid metabolism has highlighted a new\nsignaling paradigm for phospholipids. The best\ncharacterized of the intranuclear lipids are the\ninositol lipids that have critical roles in nuclear\nfunctions, such as pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA\nexport, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin\nremodeling (1). Sphingomyelin has long been\nknown to be a component of the nuclear matrix\n(2), but the possibility that sphingolipids are also\nmetabolized within the nucleus has only recently\nemerged from observations that enzymes control-\n\nling sphingolipid metabolism, including neutral\nsphingomyelinase and ceramidase, are also\npresent in the nucleus (3).\n\nSphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphin-\ngolipid metabolite that regulates many cellular\nand physiological processes, including cell growth,\nsurvival, movement, angiogenesis, vascular mat-\nuration, immunity, and lymphocyte trafficking\n(4\u20136). Most of its actions are mediated by bind-\ning to a family of five heterotrimeric guanine\nnucleotide\u2013binding protein (G protein)-coupled\nreceptors, designated S1P1-5 (5). S1P may also\nfunction inside the cell independently of S1P re-\nceptors (4); however, direct intracellular targets\nof S1P have not been identified. Since the dis-\ncovery that S1P is produced intracellularly by two\nclosely related sphingosine kinase isoenzymes,\nSphK1 and SphK2, much has been learned about\nSphK1 and its functions, yet those of SphK2\nremain enigmatic (7).\n\nBecause, in many cells, SphK2 is mainly lo-\ncalized to the nucleus or can shuttle between the\ncytosol and the nucleus in accordance with its nu-\nclear localization and export signals (8), we sought\nto determine its function there (9). In humanMCF-7\nbreast cancer cells, SphK2 is predominantly lo-\n\ncalized to the nucleus (10), where it is enzymati-\ncally active and can produce S1P from sphingosine\n(Fig. 1A). The nucleus contained high amounts of\nsphingosine (table S1), and SphK2 expression\nsignificantly increased nuclear abundance of S1P\nby sixfold and dihydro-S1P, which lacks the trans\ndouble bond at the 4 position, by twofold (Fig. 1A).\nEndogenous SphK2 was mainly associated with\nisolated chromatin and was not detected in the\nnucleoplasm (Fig. 1B). SphK2 was present in\npurified mononucleosomes fractionated by su-\ncrose density gradient centrifugation, and its distri-\nbution paralleled that of native histones (fig. S1A).\nThus, we tested whether SphK2 was associated\nwith core histone proteins. Immunoprecipitation\nof proteins from nuclear extracts prepared from\nMCF-7 cells overexpressing SphK2 or SphK1\nand subsequent Western blot analysis demon-\nstrated that histone 3 (H3) was associated with\nSphK2 (Fig. 1C), but not with SphK1. H3 was\nalso coimmunoprecipitated with catalytically\ninactive SphK2G212E (in which glycine 212 is\nreplaced by glutamic acid) (Fig. 1C), which does\nnot increase nuclear S1P (4.4 T 0.3 and 4.6 T 0.6\npmol/mg for vector andSphK2G212E, respectively);\nthese findings suggest that enzymatic activity is\nnot required for association of these two proteins.\nH3 from nuclear extracts also associated with his-\ntidine (His)\u2013tagged SphK2 isolated with Ni2+\u2013\nnitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)\u2013agarose beads (fig.\nS1B). To further confirm the specificity of the\nphysical interaction of SphK2 with H3, we mea-\nsured in vitro association of Ni-NTA-agarose\u2013\nbound His-tagged SphK2 or His-SphK1 with\nindividually purified histones. Only H3, but not\nhistones H4, H2B, or H2A, bound to SphK2 (fig.\nS1C). In contrast, none of the purified histones\ninteracted with SphK1 (fig. S1C).\n\nWe noticed that expression of SphK2 increased\nacetylation of lysine 9 of H3 (H3-K9), lysine 5 of\nhistone H4 (H4-K5), and lysine 12 of histone H2B\n(H2B-K12) (Fig. 2A), without affecting acetyla-\ntion of other lysines or acetylation of histone H2A.\nIn contrast, expression of catalytically inactive\nSphK2G212E (Fig. 2A) or SphK1 did not influence\nacetylation of any residues examined. Although\ncatalytically inactive SphK2G212E also bound to\n\n1Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and\nthe Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth Uni-\nversity School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.\n2The Wistar Institute and Department of Chemistry, Uni-\nversity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.\n3State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute\nof Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai\n201203, P.

Depletion\nof SphK2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA)\n(Fig. 2C) reduced nuclear but not cytoplasmic\namounts of S1P and dihydro-S1P (Fig. 2D), con-\nsistent with the specificity of SphK2 for both\nsphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (11). As ex-\npected from its cytosolic localization, siRNA tar-\n\ngeted to SphK1 (siSphK1) only reduced amounts\nof S1P in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). siSphK2 spe-\ncifically decreased acetylation of H3-K9, H4-K5,\nand H2B-K12, without affecting acetylation of\nother lysines or acetylation of H2A (Fig. 2C). In\ncontrast, depletion of SphK1 had no significant\neffect on acetylation of these histone residues (Fig.\n2C). Similar results were obtained with siRNAs\ntargeted to different sequences in SphK2. Addition\nof S1P to isolated nuclei reversed the decreased\nacetylation of H3-K9, H4-K5, and H2B-K12 in-\nduced by depletion of SphK2 (fig. S2A). siRNA-\nmediated depletion of endogenous SphK2 (fig.\nS2B), but not that of overexpressed V5-SphK2\n(fig. S2C), decreased acetylation of particular his-\ntone residues (fig. S2C), which could be reversed\nby cotransfection with a siRNA-insensitive V5-\n\nSphK2 construct (fig. S2C). Together, these ob-\nservations indicate that S1P produced in the\nnucleus by endogenous SphK2 acts there to reg-\nulate histone acetylation.\n\nLysine acetylation of histones is a critical com-\nponent of an epigenetic indexing system demar-\ncating transcriptionally active chromatin domains.\nHistone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone\ndeacetylases (HDACs) maintain the delicate,\ndynamic equilibrium in acetylation levels of nu-\ncleosomal histones (12, 13). Neither S1P nor\ndihydro-S1P increased HAT activity in HeLa cell\nnuclear extracts, nor did overexpression of SphK2\n(fig. S3). In sharp contrast, S1P and dihydro-S1P\ninhibited HDAC activity in nuclear extracts by\n50%, comparedwith 95% inhibition by theHDAC\ninhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (fig. S4A). Con-\n\nFig. 1.

S4C), enhanced HDAC\nactivity (fig. S4B). This increasedHDAC activity\nwas not due to increased abundance of HDAC1\nor HDAC2 (fig. S4D). We also assessed the ef-\nfect of S1P on enzymatic activity of endogenous\nHDACs. S1P inhibited the enzymatic activity\nof immunoprecipitated HDAC1 (Fig. 3A) and\nHDAC2 (fig. S4E) almost as effectively as did\nTSA. Both S1P and dihydro-S1P also inhibited\nrecombinant HDAC1 (Fig. 3B) and HDAC2\n(fig. S4F). However, neither sphingosine nor\nlysophosphatidic acid (LPA), another bioactive\nlysophospholipid structurally related to S1P,\nhad significant effects on HDAC1 (Fig. 3B)\nor HDAC2 activity (fig. S4F). Thus, S1P and\ndihydro-S1P appear to be endogenous inhibi-\ntors of HDAC. To provide further evidence that\nHDACs are targets for S1P, we examined binding\nof endogenousHDACs in nuclear extracts to S1P\nimmobilized on agarose beads. Both HDAC1 and\nHDAC2 were associated with matrices carrying\nS1P but not by control or LPAmatrices (Fig. 3C).\nIn contrast, other class I HDACs (HDAC3,\nHDAC8), class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5,\nHDAC7), class IIb HDAC (HDAC6), and the\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)\u2013\ndependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 did not\nbind to S1P agarose beads (fig. S5). 32P-labeled\nS1P specifically bound to either His-tagged\n\nHDAC1 or HDAC2 immobilized on Ni-NTA-\nagarose beads and was displaced by excess\nunlabeled S1P (fig. S6). Modeling of S1P into\nthe active site of the HDAC1 homolog from the\nhyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus\n(14) revealed that it docks well (fig. S7), with a\npredicted binding energy comparable to that of\nsuberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (fig.\nS7), a potent inhibitor of HDACs. Indeed, both\nSAHA and TSA completely displaced bound\n[32P]S1P from HDAC1 and decreased binding\nto HDAC2 to a similar extent, as did excess un-\nlabeled S1P (fig. S6). To determine whether en-\ndogenous S1P is bound to nuclear HDAC1, we\nmeasured the abundance of sphingolipids in\nHDAC1 immunoprecipitates from nuclear ex-\ntracts by mass spectrometry. Of all the sphingo-\nlipids present in the nucleus, only S1Pwas bound\nto HDAC1 (Fig. 3D and table S1). Thus, S1P can\nbind to the active site of HDAC1 and HDAC2\nand inhibit their activity.\n\nHDAC1 and HDAC2 are catalytically active\ncomponents of distinct multiprotein co-repressor\ncomplexes that include Sin3 and NuRD. Over-\nexpressed SphK2 associated with proteins of these\nco-repressor complexes, mSin3A and MBD2/3,\nand with HDAC1 and HDAC2 (fig. S8A). En-\ndogenous SphK2 also associated with HDAC1\nand HDAC2 and interacted with histone H3\n(fig. S8B). These results place SphK2, the enzyme\nthat produces S1P in the nucleus, in close prox-\n\nimity to its potential nuclear targets. To determine\nwhether nuclear S1P levels are regulated in\nresponse to external signals and whether HDACs\nsense these changes, we treated cells with phorbol\n12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of\nprotein kinase C, which enhances phosphoryl-\nation and catalytic activity of SphK2 (15). Indeed,\nPMA increased amounts of S1P in the nucleus\nbymore than twofoldwithin 5min (fig. S8C) and\nalso rapidly enhanced colocalization of SphK2\nwith HDAC1 (fig. S9). Prolonged treatment\nwith PMA induced nuclear export of SphK2 (8)\n(fig. S9), which ensured transient inhibition of\nHDACs.\n\nA common response to inhibition or depletion\nof HDAC1 or HDAC2 is the induction of cyclin-\ndependent kinase inhibitor p21 independently of\nthe p53 tumor suppressor protein (16\u201319). In\nagreement with possible involvement of SphK2\nin p53-independent expression of p21 (10), silenc-\ning SphK2 in MCF-7 cells reduced basal and\nPMA-induced accumulation of p21 protein\n(fig. S10A) and mRNA (fig. S10B). Overexpres-\nsion of SphK2, but not catalytically inactive\nSphK2, enhanced PMA-stimulated transcription\nof a reporter construct containing the p21 pro-\nmoter (fig. S10C), and its depletion reduced it\n(fig. S10D). Overexpression of SphK2 increased\nacetylation of histone H3-K9 associated with the\nproximal p21 promoter and further enhanced the\nresponse to PMA (Fig. 4A), in accordance with\n\nFig. 3. S1P binds and in-\nhibits HDAC1. (A and B)\nEffect of S1P and dihydro-\nS1P on HDAC1 activity. HeLa\ncell nuclear extracts were im-\nmunoprecipitated with con-\ntrol IgG or HDAC1-specific\nantibody.

S10, A to D). Chromatin\nimmunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis also re-\nvealed that, like HDAC1, SphK2 is also asso-\nciated with the proximal p21 promoter (Fig. 4A).\nDepletion of SphK2 suppressed PMA-induced\nacetylation of histone H3 at the p21 promoter\n(Fig. 4C), which further supported the notion that\nSphK2 regulates HDAC1-dependent deacety-\nlation of histone H3 and repression of p21 gene\ntranscription.\n\nWe also examined another target gene that\nshows increased transcription in cells treated with\nPMA, c-fos (12, 20). SphK2 depletion compro-\nmised the induction of endogenous c-fos expres-\nsion by PMA (fig. S11A) and blocked enhanced\nc-fos promoter activity (fig. S11B). Overexpres-\nsion of SphK2, but not that of catalytically\ninactive SphK2, increased PMA-induced expres-\nsion of c-fos mRNA (fig. S11C) and enhanced\nc-fos promoter activity (fig. S11D). Finally, ChIP\nanalysis confirmed the presence of SphK2 on the\n\nc-fos promoter and demonstrated that overex-\npression of SphK2 (but not that of the mutant\nSphK2 that cannot produce S1P) enhanced H3\nacetylation at the c-fos promoter (Fig. 4B). Con-\nversely, down-regulation of SphK2 decreased\nacetylation of histone H3 at the c-fos promoter\nin response to PMA (Fig. 4D).\n\nWe conclude that HDACs appear to be intra-\ncellular targets of S1P. Our data reveal a new\nparadigm of S1P signaling produced by nuclear\nsphingolipid metabolism, suggesting an impor-\ntant function for SphK2 in the nucleus. Abun-\ndance of nuclear S1P may influence specific and\ncontextual chromatin states that impact gene tran-\nscription (Fig. 4E). HDACs have emerged as key\ntargets to reverse aberrant epigenetic changes asso-\nciated with human diseases (18, 21), such as can-\ncer. S1P may therefore influence the delicate\nbalance and dynamic turnover of histone acety-\nlation and the transcription of target genes, link-\ning them to epigenetic regulation in response to\nenvironmental signals.\n\nReferences and Notes\n1.

Hait et\nal. (p. 1254) report that S1P can also function by direct binding to the nuclear enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs)\n1 and 2. The enzyme that generates S1P, sphingosine kinase 2 (ShpK2) is present in the nucleus in complexes with\nHDAC1 and HDAC2. Generation of S1P and its binding to HDACs inhibited deacetylation of histone. Such histone\nmodification is an epigenetic mechanism that controls gene transcription. Thus, generation of S1P in the nucleus\nappears to be a signaling mechanism by which cells can control gene expression in response to various stimuli.\n\nView the article online\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1176709\nPermissions\nhttps://www.science.org/help/reprints-and-permissions\n\nD\now\n\nnloaded from\n https://w\n\nw\nw\n\n.science.org at U\nniversity of Southern C\n\nalifornia on M\narch 22, 2022\n\nhttps://www.science.org/about/terms-service", "inst_index": "88434", "domain": "Science 325, 1254 (2009)", "url": "http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1176709", "summary": "", "authors": ["Nitai C.

Despite the rapid progress in elucidating the SL biosynthetic pathway, the perception and signalling mechanisms\nof SL remain poorly understood. Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs\ninduce its degradation.We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53mutant,which produces an exaggerated numberof tillers\ncompared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment.\nTheD53 gene product shares predicted featureswith the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complexwith the a/b\nhydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling com-\nponents potentially responsible for SL perception.Wedemonstrate that, in aD14- andD3-dependentmanner, SLs induce\nD53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth. Our combined genetic\nand biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced degra-\ndation represents a key molecular link between SL perception and responses.\n\nShoot branching (tillering in crops) is a major determinant of plant\narchitecture and crop yield, which is under the integrated control of\nhormonal, developmental and environmental factors1\u20133. Although the\nexistence of a root-derived transmissible shoot-repressing signal was\nproposed more than 70 years ago4, the identity of this signal(s) has\nremained elusive. Recent studies with branching mutants in several\nplant species have demonstrated that SLs, a specific group of terpenoid\nlactones, are the long-sought branching-repressing hormones, whose\nfunction are highly conserved in both monocots and dicots5,6. In addi-\ntion to repressing shoot branching, SLs also have a role in regulating\nroot growth, leaf senescence and flower development7. SLs also act as\nexogenous signals to promote the symbiosis between land plants and\narbuscularmycorrhizal fungi8 and stimulate the germination of the para-\nsitic weeds Striga and Orobanche, which are serious agricultural pests\nin many parts of the world9.\nPrevious studies have shown that DWARF 3 (D3), D10, D14 (also\n\nknown as HIGH-TILLERING DWARF 2, HTD2 and D88), D17 (also\nknown asHTD1) andD27 in rice10\u201314,MOREAXILLARYGROWTH1\n(MAX1),MAX2,MAX3 andMAX4 in Arabidopsis15\u201317, RAMOSUS 1\n(RMS1), RMS4 and RMS5 in pea18 and DECREASED APICAL\nDOMINANCE 1 (DAD1),DAD2 andDAD3 in petunia7,19 are involved\nin either thebiosynthesis or signallingof SLs.Among these genes,MAX3/\nRMS5/D17/DAD3,MAX4/RMS1/D10/DAD1,MAX1 inArabidopsis and\nD27 in rice encode the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7),\nCCD8, CYP711A1 (a cytochrome P450) and a novel b-carotene isomer-\nase, respectively, and are involved in the sequential cleavage ofb-carotene\nand synthesis of SLs20. By contrast,MAX2/RMS4/D3 andD14/DAD2,\nwhich encode an F-box protein and a protein of the a/b-hydrolase\nsuperfamily, respectively, probably have a role in SL signalling12,19,21.\n\nThe structural similarity between MAX2/RMS4/D3 proteins with the\nauxin receptor TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1)22,23\n\nand jasmonate receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1)24,\nandD14/DAD2 proteins with the gibberellin receptor GIBBERELLIN\nINSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1)25, has sparked the speculation that\nboth MAX2/RMS4/D3 and D14/DAD2 could be candidates for the\nSL receptors26 and that binding and hydrolysis of SLs by D14/DAD2\n(refs 19, 27, 28)might be required for triggering proteasome-mediated\ndegradation of an unknown repressor by the Skp1\u2013Cullin\u2013F-box-\ncontaining (SCF)MAX2 complex29,30. However, the identity of such a\nrepressor and its regulatorymechanisms inSL signallinghave remained\nunknown.\nIn this study,we identified a gain-of-function ricemutant,d53, which\n\ndisplays a SL-insensitive and increased-tillering phenotype.Map-based\ncloning revealed thatD53 encodes a protein sharing predicted features\nwith the class IClpATPase proteins and that it can forma complexwith\nthe a/b hydrolase protein D14 and the F-box protein D3. We show\nthat SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome\u2013ubiquitin path-\nway in a D14- and D3-dependent manner. Our studies establish D53\nas a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced\ndegradation is essential for SL signalling.\n\nd53 is a rice SL-insensitive mutant\nPrevious studies have identified several ricemutants defective inSLbio-\nsynthesis or signalling10\u201314. Because of their highly branched and dwarf\nphenotype, these mutants were termed \u2018d mutants\u2019, such as d3, d10,\nd14, d17 and d27. The rice d53mutant31 also displayed reduced height\nand increased tillering, as well as thinner stem and shorter crown root,\ncompared to thewild-type strain (Fig. 1a, b andExtendedDataFig. 1a, b).\n\n1National Key Laboratory for CropGenetics andGermplasmEnhancement, JiangsuPlant Gene EngineeringResearchCenter, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China. 2National Key Facility\nfor Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China. 3Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington,\nSeattle,Washington98195,USA. 4HowardHughesMedical Institute, Box357280,University ofWashington, Seattle,Washington98195,USA. 5National Centre for PlantGeneResearch (Beijing), Institute of\nGenetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1-2 Beichen West Road, Beijing 100101, China. 6Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi,\nBunkyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.\n\n4 0 6 | N A T U R E | V O L 5 0 4 | 1 9 / 2 6 D E C E M B E R 2 0 1 3\n\nMacmillan Publishers Limited.

Histological analysis revealed that the sizes of vascular\nbundles and parenchyma cells in internodes were largely comparable\nbetween d53 and wild-type plants, implying that the shortening and\nthinning of the d53 stem were mainly caused by a reduction in cell\nnumber (Extended Data Fig. 1e\u2013h). The phenotypes of F1 heterozyg-\nous plantswere intermediate between the homozygous parental plants\n(ExtendedData Fig. 2a\u2013g). Genetic analyses of anF2 population derived\nfrom a cross of d53 and thewild-type parent (Norin 8) showed that the\nnormal, intermediate and dwarf plants segregated as 1:2:1 (33:58:28,\nx25 0.09, P. 0.05), indicating that the d53 mutation behaved in a\nsemi-dominant manner (Extended Data Fig. 2h).\nThe phenotypic similarity between d53 and the previously reported\n\nrice dmutants prompted us to examine whether d53 is defective in SL-\nmediated inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. Quantitative PCRwith\nreverse transcription (qRT\u2013PCR) analysis showed that expression of\nD10 (encoding CCD8) was similarly upregulated in d53 (Fig. 1d) as in\nother d mutants, owing to feedback regulation in the SL pathway11.\nIn addition, expression of an inhibitor of axillary bud outgrowth,\nFINE CULM 1 (FC1)32, which is orthologous to the maize TEOSINTE\nBRANCHED1 (TB1)33 and the Arabidopsis BRANCHED 1 (BRC1)34,\nwas also similarly downregulated in the d53, d14 and d27 mutants\n(Fig. 1d), suggesting that D53 is probably involved in SL biosynthesis\n\nor signalling.Moreover, exogenous application of a SL analogue,GR24,\neffectively inhibited the outgrowth axillary buds of d27, but not d14 or\nd53 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013c). Further, measurement of\nSLs produced in the root exudates showed that d53 accumulatedmark-\nedly higher levels of 29-epi-5-deoxystrigol (epi-5DS), a native SL of rice,\nthan the wild-type cultivar Norin 8 (Fig. 1f). These results indicate that\nd53 is a SL-insensitive mutant.\n\nD53 acts as a repressor of SL signalling\nD53was previously mapped to the terminal region of the short arm of\nrice chromosome 11 (ref. 35). To decipher themolecular defect in d53,\nwe isolatedD53 by a map-based cloning approach. Using an F2 popu-\nlation of , 12,000 plants generated from the cross between Ketan\nNangka and the mutant, we further delimited the D53 locus to a 34-\nkilobase DNA region on the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)\nclone OSJNBa0032J07, which contains three putative genes (Fig. 2a).\nSequence analysis revealed a single-nucleotide substitution and 15-\nnucleotide deletion in the third exon of LOC_Os11g01330 in d53,\nwhich resulted in an amino acid substitution (R812T) and deletion\nof five amino acids (813GKTGI817) (Fig. 2b). To verify that this muta-\ntion caused the tillering dwarf phenotype, we generated transgenic\nplants expressing the wild-type or mutantD53 gene under the control\n\nf\n\nWT d53 d27\n\nND\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nep\ni-\n\n5\nD\n\nS\n (\nn\ng\n\n g\nfw\n\n\u2013\n1\n)\n\nRoot exudates\n\n1.17\n\n0\n\n7.36\n\ne\n\n+GR24 (1 \u03bcM)\n\nWT d53 d14 d27\n\nMock\n\nd\n\nWT d53 d27d14\n0\n\n0.5\n\n8\n\n6\n\n10\n\n12\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n e\n\nx\np\n\nre\ns\ns\nio\n\nn\n\n1\n\nD10\nFC1\n\nc\n\nWT\n\nd53\n\n1 3 5 7 9 11\nWeeks after germination\n\nT\nill\n\ne\nr \n\nn\nu\nm\n\nb\ne\nr\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nb\n\nWT d53\n\na\n\nWT d53\n\n**\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n**\n\n**\n*\n\n**\n**\n\n****\n\n**\n\n**\n\nFigure 1 | Phenotype of d53 mutant. a, b, Phenotype of wild type (WT) and\nd53mutant at 4-week-old seedling stage (a) or heading stage (b).White arrows\nindicate the first tillers in d53, which is usually absent in wild type, and red\narrows show the second tillers. c, Comparison of tillering kinetics at different\ndevelopmental stages. d, qRT\u2013PCR assay showing altered expression of D10\nand FC1 in d mutants. e, Responses of rice seedlings to GR24 treatment.\nRed and white arrowheads indicate the first and second tillers, respectively.\nf, Liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS)\nmeasurement of epi-5DS levels in root exudates. gfw, per gram fresh weight;\nND, not detected.

The severity of tillering phenotype in these transgenic plants\nwas correlatedwith the expression level of the transgene. Notably, over-\nexpression of the wild-type D53 gene also caused a moderate increase\nin tillering, compared to the vector control plants (Fig. 2c\u2013e). These\nobservations suggested that the D53 protein acts as a repressor in the\nSL-mediated branching-inhibition pathway and that the dominant til-\nlering phenotype of the d53mutant was most likely caused by a gain-\nof-function mutation in d53. To further confirm this, we generated\nD53 knockdown transgenic plants using an RNA interference (RNAi)\napproach. As expected, reducingD53 expression in a d53 background\nmarkedly reduced the tiller number (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). Taken\ntogether, these data support the proposition that the d53 mutation\nenhances D53 activity in repressing SL signalling.\nD53 is predicted to encode a protein of 1,131 amino acids. ABLAST\n\nsearch identified a closely related homologue of D53 (designatedD53-\nlike, LOC_Os12g01360) with 96.6% amino acid sequence identity in\nthe rice genome. Further, D53-like proteins were found in other mono-\ncots and dicots, but not in lower plants, animals or microbes, indicating\nthat theD53-like clade is specific to higher plants (ExtendedData Fig. 4).\nSequence analysis by the HHpred structure prediction server revealed\nthat D53 shares a similar secondary structure composition, despite low\nprimary sequencehomology, toproteins of the class IClpATPase family,\nwhich are characterizedbyanN-terminal domain, aD1ATPasedomain,\nan M domain and a D2 ATPase domain36. Notably, the D2 domain of\nD53 contains a highly conserved linear sequence, Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-\nLeu, which closely matches the ethylene-responsive element binding\nfactor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR)motif (Extended Data\nFig. 5),which is known to interactwith theTOPLESS family of proteins\nand is involved in transcriptional repression37.\n\nqPCRanalysis revealed thatD53waswidely expressed in the examined\nrice tissues (Fig. 2f ). A D53-promoter-driven GUS (b-glucuronidase)\nreporter gene (pD53::GUS) assay showed thatGUS stainingwasobserved\nin the vasculature in roots, shoots, leaves, leaf sheaths, nodes, internodes\nand young panicles, preferentially in the parenchyma cells surrounding\nthe xylem (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013h). Moreover, D53 expression was\nupregulated by GR24 treatment in wild-type plants, but downregu-\nlated in six dmutants, suggesting that expression ofD53 is regulated by\nSLsignalling (Fig. 2g, h).TheD53\u2013green fluorescentprotein (GFP) fusion\nprotein is exclusively localized to the nucleus in rice protoplasts and the\npAct1::D53-GFP transgenic root cells (Extended Data Fig. 6i\u2013p).\n\nd\n\n15% input\n\n\u2013 +\n\nGST pull-down\n\nGST\u2013D3\u2013OSK1\u2013 + \u2013 +\n\nGST+ \u2013 + \u2013\n\nGR24\u2013 \u2013 + +\n\nAnti-D14\n34\n\n26\n\nc\n\nGST\u2013D14\n\npull-down\n\n5% input\n\nMBP\u2013D3\u2013 +\u2013 +\nMBP+ \u2013+ \u2013\n\nGR24\u2013 \u2013+ +\n\n130\n\n130\n\n55\n\n55\n\nAnti-MBP\n\nb CY eYFP DAPI BF Merged\n\n\u2013\nG\n\nR\n2\n4\n\n+\nG\n\nR\n2\n4\n\nNY\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nD14\n\nD53\n\nD14 D53\n\nD14 D53\n\na +GR24\u2013GR24\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nD53\n\nd53\n\nD53\n\nAD\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nD14\n\nD14\n\nD14\n\nBD\n\n\u2013LT \u2013LTHA\n+X-\u03b1-gal\n\n\u2013LT \u2013LTHA\n+X-\u03b1-gal\n\nkDa\n\n*\n\n*\n\nkDa\n\nFigure 3 | GR24 promotes the D53\u2013D14 and D14\u2013D3 interaction. a, Y2H\nassay showing that D53 and d53 interact with D14 in the presence of GR24.\nYeast transformants were spotted on the control medium (SD2Leu/2Trp\n(2LT)) and selective medium (SD 2Leu/2Trp/2His/2Ade (2LTHA) plus\nX-a-gal).

Interestingly, its binding\nactivity was inhibited by the M and D2 domains, although their nega-\ntive effect can be overcome by the N domain (Extended Data Fig. 7).\nWe verified the D53\u2013D14 interaction in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf\ncell nucleus both in the presence or absence of exogenously applied\nGR24 using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay\n(Fig. 3b).Theobserved interactionbetweenD53 andD14 in the absence\nof exogenously applied GR24might be due to the effect of endogenous\nSLs present in the tobacco leaf cells. Consistent with the previously\nreported GR24-depedent interaction between DAD2 and PhMAX2A\n(anorthologue ofD3 inpetunia) in yeast19, our in vitropull-downassay\nalso revealed a direct physical interaction between D14 and D3 in a\nGR24-dependent manner (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, using recombinant\nglutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013D3\u2013OSK1 fusion protein as the bait,\nour in vitro pull-down assay showed that D14 could bemore efficiently\nco-immunoprecipitated from d3 plant extracts in the presence of exo-\ngenously applied GR24 (Fig. 3d). Together, these results suggest that\nSLs may act to promote complex formation among D14, D3 and D53,\nlinking D53 to the hormone-perception components of the SL signal-\nling pathway.\n\nGR24 promotes D53 protein degradation\nTo investigate how SL regulates D53, we performed a set of additional\nexperiments. Both western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy\nexamination showed that GR24 treatment induced rapid degradation\nof the D53 protein in wild-type cells, but not in d3 or d14mutant cells\n(Fig. 4a\u2013c). We further showed that D53 was degraded by the protea-\nsome, as a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, but not other protease inhibi-\ntors, effectively blocked GR24-inducedD53\u2013GFP degradation (Fig. 4c, d\nand ExtendedData Fig. 8a, b). Notably, unlike thewild-typeD53\u2013GFP\nfusionprotein, themutant d53\u2013GFP fusionprotein appeared to be stable\nin the presence of GR24 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 8b). Interes-\ntingly, we noted that D53\u2013GFP and D53\u2013luciferase (LUC) were still\ndegraded in the d53 mutant cells, but not in d3 or d14 mutant cells\n(Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8c), indicating that the D53 degrada-\ntion pathway was still operational in the d53mutant. Together, these\nresults suggest that SL triggers proteasome-mediated degradation of\nD53 in a D14- and D3-dependent manner. Importantly, the insensi-\ntivity of d53 protein to SL-triggered turnover is consistent with the\nobserved dominant gain-of-function mutant phenotype of d53.\nTo provide genetic support for the functional relationship between\n\nD53, D3 and D14, we generated d3 d53 and d14 d53 double mutants.\nThe d3 mutant had more tillers and it was shorter than the d14 and\n\nd53 singlemutants (ExtendedDataFig. 9a). Thed14d53doublemutants\nexhibited a dwarf tillering phenotype resembling the d14 and d53 par-\nental plants, whereas the d3d53doublemutant exhibited a dwarf tillering\nphenotype resembling d3 (Fig. 4e, f and Extended Data Fig. 9a). The\nlack of obvious additive effects among these mutants suggests thatD3,\nD14 and D53 act in the same signalling pathway. To further test their\nepistatic relationship, we knocked downD53 gene expression in the d3\nandd14backgrounds.As shown inFig. 4g andExtendedData Fig. 9b\u2013d,\nthe mutant phenotype of d3 and d14 was restored to nearly wild-type\nlevels, demonstrating that D53 acts downstream of D3 and D14, and\nthat accumulation of D53 protein is responsible for blocking SL sig-\nnalling and conferring the dwarf tillering phenotype in these mutants.\n\nDiscussion\nIt has been speculated that perception of SLs triggers the degradation\nof putative repressors by the SCFMAX2 ubiquitin ligase complex to sup-\npress shoot branching21,29,30. In this study, we established that D53 acts\nas a repressor of SL signalling in rice. Consistentwith theprevious obser-\nvation ofGR24-dependent interaction betweenDAD2 and PhMAX2A\n(ref. 19), we found that GR24 also promotes the interaction between\nD14with D53 andD3 (Fig. 3). Further, we showed that D53 is targeted\nfor degradation by the proteasome in a D14- and D3-dependent man-\nner (Fig. 4a\u2013d and Extended data Fig. 8). Together, these data collec-\ntively support the notion that SL perception by D14 acts to promote\nubiquitination of D53 by the D14\u2013SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase, and subse-\nquent degradation of D53 by the proteasome, leading to the propaga-\ntion of SL signal and downstream physiological responses (Fig. 5). Our\nfindings revealed a remarkable similarity between the hormonal per-\nception and signalling mechanism of SL and several other classes of\nplant hormones, including auxin, jasmonate and gibberellin25,38\u201340.\nInterestingly, a recent study reported that aD53 homologue inAra-\n\nbidopsis, SMAX1, acts downstream ofMAX2 (orthologue of rice D3)\nin repressing the seed germination and seedling photomorphogenesis\nphenotypes ofmax2, but not the lateral root formation, axillary shoot\ngrowth, or senescence phenotypes ofmax2 (ref. 41). Further, as observed\nfor D53, three closest homologues of D53 in Arabidopsis (designated\nSMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8) were also induced by GR24 treatment41,\nsuggesting thatD53 and its homologues have a broad role in regulating\ndifferent developmental processes and that the D3/D53 functional\nmodule is conserved between monocots and dicots. Consistent with\nthis notion, the SL-analogous compounds known as karrikins also use\na MAX2- and KAI2 (D14-LIKE)-dependent pathway to regulate seed\ngermination and seedling growth29,42. The identification and charac-\nterization of D53 in SL signalling now sets the stage for further dis-\nsection of the mechanisms by which SLs regulate plant form and its\ncomplex interactions with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular\nmycorrhizal fungi3.\n\nMETHODS SUMMARY\nThe Methods provide detailed information about all experimental procedures,\nincluding description of plant materials and growth conditions, map-based clon-\ning ofD53, vector construction and plant transformation, rice hydroponic culture\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\ns\ntr\n\ne\na\nm\n\n \n  \n  \nta\n\nrg\ne\nts\n\nD14\n\nSL\n\nD53\n\nD\n5\n3\n\nD14\n\n    SCF \ncomplex\n\n  \n  \nS\n\nC\nF\n \n\nco\nm\n\np\nle\n\nx\n\no\nm\n\npS\nC\n\nm\np\nl\n\nS\nC\n\nF\np\nlelele\n\nx\n\nC\nF exex\n\nE2\n\nD14\n\nSL\n\nSL\n\nUbiquitination\n\n      Proteasome\n\nUbiquitin\n\n  \n \n\ncoco\n\nDD\n\nD3\n\nD3\n\nFC1\n\nE2\n\nD\n53\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\ns\ntre\n\na\nm\n\n     ta\nrg\n\ne\nts\n\n      D53\ndegradation\n\nFigure 5 | A schematic model depicting that SL promotes D14\u2013SCFD3-\nmediated degradation ofD53.

The wild-type rice (Oryza sativa L.\nsubspecies japonica) varieties used in this study were Norin 8 (for d53, d14 and\nd27), Akumuro (for d3), Shiokari (for d10 and d17) and Kitaake (for transforma-\ntion analyses). The d53-carrying line, KL908,was initially identified fromamutant\nlibrary of Norin 8 mutagenized by 60Co-c irradiation31. The d27 and d14mutants\nwere describedpreviously14,43. The d3mutant used in thiswork carries a premature\nstop codon (unpublished data). The d14 d53 and d3 d53 double mutants were\ngenerated by crossing their respective parental lines and identified by genotyping\nfrom their respective F2 or F3 populations.\nRice plantswere cultivated in the experimental field at theNanjingAgricultural\n\nUniversity in Nanjing in the natural growing seasons. For qRT\u2013PCR, GR24 treat-\nment, SL analyses and transient expression assay, the seedlings of wild-type and\nmutants were grown in climate chambers (HP1500GS, Ruihua) at 70% humidity,\nunder long-day conditions with daily cycles of 14 h of light at 30 uC and 10 h of\ndark at 25 uC. Light was provided by fluorescent white-light tubes (400\u2013700 nm,\n250mmolm22 s21).\nMap-based cloning of D53. To map the D53 locus, the d53mutant was crossed\nwith a polymorphic javanica variety, Ketan Nangka. Rough mapping was per-\nformed with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers W1 (59-GGATGATGAGA\nTCCTAATGTAGAA-39 and 59-CATCCTTGGAAAATAGTGGG-39) and W2\n(59-GGCTTCATCTTTGGCGACC-39 and 59-CCGGATTCACGAGATAAACT\nCTC-39) using 242 normal plants obtained in the F2 population. Using 2,893 nor-\nmal plants,D53was finally mapped to a region between the SSRmarker Z7 (59-C\nAGAGACCAAGCAACAGAG-39 and 59-GGAGACGTGTGAGCTACAAC-39)\nand a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker Z3 (59-G\nTTACCGCTCCTCCTCAGC-39 and 59-AGTAAAAATGTGGAGGGGCA-39).\nVector construction and plant transformation.To generate the pAct1::D53-GFP\nand pAct1::d53-GFP constructs, full-length complementaryDNAs (cDNAs) ofD53\nand d53 were amplified, and the PCR products were then cloned into the binary\nvector AHLG44 using the In-Fusion Advantage PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech) and\nsequenced (Biomed). The pAct1::GFP, pAct1::D53-GFP and pAct1::d53-GFP con-\nstructs were introduced into the wild-type variety Kitaake. The pAct1::D53-GFP\ntransgene was introduced into d3 and d14 backgrounds by genetic crosses.\nTo knock down the D53 gene, the D53-RNA interference (D53-RNAi) vector\n\nwas constructed using a 475-base pair cDNA fragment. The PCR fragment was\ncloned into the pEASY-Blunt cloning vector (TransGen), and the gene-specific\nfragmentwaspreparedbydouble digestionwithKpnI-SacI andPstI-BamHI, respec-\ntively, and then the PCR products were ligated to both sides of the FAD2 intron in\nthe binary vector pCUbi1390-DFAD2 in opposite orientation45 and sequenced.\nThe resultant constructs D53-RNAi and the control vector pCUbi1390-DFAD2\nwere separately introduced into d53, d3 and d14mutants.\nTo analyse the expression pattern of the D53 gene, a 2.7-kilobase promoter\n\nfragment was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA-1381Z and sequenced to\ncreate the pD53::GUS reporter gene construct, which was then introduced into\nwild-type rice cultivar Norin 8. All transgenic rice plants were generated using\nAgrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice calli, as described previously46.\nRice hydroponic culture and LC/MS\u2013MS analysis of epi-5DS. Preparation of\nhydroponic culture solution and treatment with GR24 (http://www.chiralix.com/)\nwere performed as described previously6. In brief, surface-sterilized rice seedswere\nincubated in sterilewater at 30 uC in the dark for 2 days. The germinated seedswere\ntransferred intohydroponic culturemediumsolidifiedwith 0.5%agar and cultured\nat 30 uC for 5 days. The 1-week-old seedlings were then transferred to a plastic pot\ncontaining hydroponic culture solution (500ml) and grown for an additional\n7 days (total 2weeks) or 28 days (total 5weeks). The hydroponic culture solution\nwith or without 1mMGR24 was renewed every week. For SL analysis, the 1-week-\nold seedlings were grown in hydroponic culture medium without Pi for an addi-\ntional 14 days (total 3weeks).\nSL analysis in rice root exudates was performed according to a previously\n\ndescribedmethod14 withminormodifications. For each sample, theweight of fresh\nrice roots was recorded and 50ml hydroponic culture medium was loaded onto a\npre-equilibratedOasisHLB3cc cartridges (Waters) after adding1 ngd6-5DSas the\ninternal standard. Subsequently, the columns were washed with de-ionized water.\nThe SL-containing fraction, eluted with acetone, was collected and dried up under\nnitrogen gas, then reconstructed in acetonitrile and subjected to UPLC\u2013MS/MS\nanalysis. The UPLC\u2013MS/MS system consists of a triple quadruple tandem mass\nspectrometer (Quattro Premier XE;WatersMSTechnology) and anAcquity Ultra\nPerformance Liquid Chromatograph (Acquity UPLC; Waters) equipped with a\nreverse phase column (BEH-C18, 2.13 100mm, 1.7mm;Waters).Mobile phase A\n(99.95% H2O 1 0.05% acetic acid) and mobile phase B (99.95% ACN 1 0.05%\nacetic acid) were pumped at a rate of 0.4mlmin21. The gradient started with 50%\nA and increased B from 50% to 70% in 5min. The column temperature was set\nto 25 uC. MS parameters were set to the following values: desolvation gas flow,\n\n800L h21; capillary voltage, 3.8 kV; cone voltage, 24V; desolvation temperature,\n350 uC; source temperature, 110 uC; collision energy 14V, using multiple reaction\nmonitoring (MRM) transition of m/z 331. 216 for the epi-5DS detection, and\nMRM transition of m/z 337. 222 for the d6-5DS detection. Data were analysed\nwithMassLynx software (V.4.1). The epi-5DS concentrations of rice exudates were\ncalculated by comparing the MRM relative response of epi-5DS with the d6-5DS\nones then divided by the weight of fresh rice roots.\nqRT\u2013PCR.Total RNAwas extracted using theRNeasy PlantMini Kit (QIAGEN).\nThen, 20ml cDNA was synthesized using 1mg RNA with the QuantiTect Reverse\nTranscription Kit (QIAGEN). qRT\u2013PCR (20ml reaction volume) was carried out\nusing 0.5ml cDNA, 0.2mMof each gene-specific primer and SYBR Premix Ex Taq\nKit (TaKaRa) in an ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The rice ubiquitin gene was used as the internal control.\nThe gene-specific primersused forqRT\u2013PCRare: ubiquitin gene (LOC_Os03g13170)\n(59-AACCAGCTGAGGCCCAAGA-39 and 59-ACGATTGATTTAACCAGTCCA\nTGA-39); D53 gene (59-CCAAGCAGTTTGAAGCGAC-39 and 59-CCGCAAGTT\nTATCAAAGTCAA-39);D10 gene (59-CGTGGCGATATCGATGGT-39 and 59-CG\nACCTCCTCGAACGTCTT-39); FC1 gene (59-CGACAGCGGCAGCTACTAC-39\nand 59-GCGAATTGGCGTAGACGA-39). Data from three replicates were analysed\nfollowing the relative quantification method47.\nHistological analysis and GUS staining. Culm segments of rice were fixed in\nFAA (formalin/acetic acid/50% ethanol, 2:1:17 (v/v/v)) overnight, followed by a\nseries of dehydration and infiltration, and embedded in paraffin (Paraplast Plus;\nSigma-Aldrich). The tissues were sliced into 8\u201312-mm sections with a microtome\n(Leica RM2265), and affixed tomicroscope slides. Paraffin was removed from the\nsections using xylene, and the sections were dehydrated through a gradient eth-\nanol series, and stained with toluidine blue. Sections were viewed under a light\nmicroscope (Leica DM5000B) and photographed using a Micro Colour charge-\ncoupled device camera (Leica DFC490).\nGUS histochemical staining was performed according to a method described\n\npreviously48. Various tissues or hand-cut sections of pD53::GUST1 generation trans-\ngenicplantswere incubated in a staining solution containing 100mMNaPO4 buffer,\npH7.0, 2mMX-Gluc, 0.5mMK3Fe(CN)6, 0.5mMK4Fe(CN)6, 0.1%TritonX-100\nand 10 mM Na2-EDTA at 37 uC. Samples were vacuum-infiltrated briefly at the\ninitiation of stainingwithX-Gluc solution.After staining, the staining solutionwas\nremoved and the sample was washedwith several changes of 50% ethanol until the\ntissue became clear. Images were taken directly or under the stereomicroscope.\nY2H assay. Coding regions of the rice D53, d53 and various domain deletion\nvariants ofD53were cloned into the Y2H \u2018prey\u2019 vector pGADT7 (Clontech). The\ncoding region of riceD14 was cloned into the Y2H \u2018bait\u2019 vector pGBKT7 (Clontech).\nBait andpreyconstructswereco-transformed into theyeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)\nstrain Y2HGold (Clontech) and the resultant yeast stains were grown on SD2Leu/\n2Trp plates for 3 days at 30 uC. Interactions between bait and preywere examined on\nthe control media2LT (SD2Leu/2Trp) and selectivemedia2LTHA (SD2Leu/\n2Trp/2His/2Ade) or2LTHA plus X-a-gal in the presence or absence of 5mM\nGR24. Plates were incubated for 4 days at 30 uC. Yeast strains containingD53, d53\nor D14 in combination with pGADT7 or pGBKT7 were used as controls.\nAntibody preparation. For detection of D53, a His-fused protein-specific poly-\npeptide (amino acids 963\u20131,112 of D53 protein) was expressed in BMRosetta\n(DE3) cells (Biomed), and then affinity purified. Subsequently, the recombination\nprotein was injected into rabbits to produce polyclonal antibodies against D53\n(Abmart). For detection of D14 protein, a His-fused polypeptide (amino acids\n153\u2013302 of D14) was expressed in BMRosetta (DE3) cells. Purified fusion protein\nwas injected into rats to produce polyclonal antibodies against D14 (Abmart).\nThe loading control used is anti-HSP82 antibody (Beijing Protein Innovation).\nIn vivo degradation assay of D53.One-week-old rice seedlings were treated with\nor without 5 mMGR24 and collected at different time points. To block proteaso-\nmal protein degradation, seedlings were pre-treated with 40mM MG132 for 2 h.\nTotal protein was extracted and denatured in the SDS sample buffer containing\n5%b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME) at 95 uC for 10min.Western blots were performed\nusing the antiserum against D53 and visualized by an enhanced horseradish\nperoxidase-diaminobenzidine (HRP-DAB) substrate kit (Tiangen).\nThe pAct1::D53-GFP and pAct1::d53-GFP transgenic plants were treated with\n\n5 mM GR24 with or without the following inhibitors: MG132 (40 mM), AEBSF\n(500 mM), pepstatinA (1 mM)or leupeptin (20mM).GFP fluorescence in nuclei of\ntransgenic root cells was observed and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scan-\nning confocal microscope.\nBiFC assay. The full-length D14 and D53 cDNAs were cloned into the binary\nvectors pSPYNE173 and pSPYCE(M) to create the D14-NY andD53-CY vectors,\nrespectively. For transient expression,A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 carrying the\ngene of interest (at anOD600 of 0.1)was co-infiltratedwith p19 strain into a 5-week-\nold N. benthamiana leaf as described previously49. After 2 days, infiltrated leaves\nwere sprayed with (1) or without (2) 5mM GR24 24 h before leaf excision. The\n\nARTICLE RESEARCH\n\nMacmillan Publishers Limited.

The wavelengths for eYFP and\nDAPI were 514 and 405 nm for excitation, and 527 and 488 nm for detection,\nrespectively.\nRecombinant protein preparation. The full-length open reading frames of D3\u2013\nOSK1 and D14 were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector, generating a fusion with\nthe GST protein. The full-length cDNA of D3 was cloned into the pMAL-c2x\nvector to generate a fusion withMBP. Expression of GST, GST\u2013D3\u2013OSK1, GST\u2013\nD14,MBP andMBP\u2013D3 inBL21Rosetta cells was inducedwith 0.1mM isopropyl-\nb-D-thiogalactoside at 20 uC for 16h. Fusionproteinswere purified usingGSTBind\nResin (Novagen) or amylose-affinity chromatography (New England Biolabs)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols and quantified by the Bio-Rad protein\nassay reagent.\nPull-down assays.One-week-old rice seedlingswere pre-treatedwith 40mMMG132\nfor 1h and then treated with or without 5mMGR24 for 30min. Total proteins were\nsubsequently extracted in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50mM\nTris-HCl, pH7.2, 150mM NaCl, 10mMMgCl2, 13 complete protease inhibitor\ncocktail, Roche) containing 40mMMG132. After centrifugation (16,000g at 4 uC),\nthe supernatant was collected. Total protein concentration was determined by the\nBradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Roughly equal amounts of purified GST and\nGST\u2013D3\u2013OSK1 fusion proteins (about 50mg) were affixed to GST Bind Resin and\nthen mixed with 300ml of plant extract (containing 1.5mg total proteins). After\nbeing gently shaken at 25 uC for 15min, the resinwaswashed five timeswith RIPA\nbuffer. During all the procedures, 5mMGR24 was added to the assay mixture for\nGR24-treated seedlings and was not added to the protein samples from seedlings\nnot treated with GR24. Proteins were detected with anti-D14 antibodies at 1:1,000\ndilution and visualizedwith enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GEHealthcare).\nFor in vitro pull-down, GST\u2013D14 (5 mg) was incubated withMBP\u2013D3 (6 mg) or\n\nMBP (2mg) at 25 uC for 15min in300ml of binding buffer (20mMTris-HCl, pH7.6,\n2.5mM b-ME and 0.1M NaCl) with or without 10mM GR24. After incubation,\n20ml of GST resin was added. After further incubation at 25 uC for 15min, the\nresin was washed five times with the washing buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,\n500mM NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100). The washing buffer also contains 10 mM\nGR24 where appropriate. After washing, 40 ml of 13 SDS\u2013PAGE sample buffer\nwere added, themixture was denatured, and the sample was loaded on a 8% SDS\u2013\nPAGEgel, and proteins were detected by theHRP-conjugated anti-MBP antibody\n(NewEngland Biolabs) and visualizedwith enhanced chemiluminescence reagent\n(GE Healthcare).\n\nTransient expression assays. TheD53, d53,D3 andD14 full-length cDNAs were\ncloned into the vector pA7-GFP or pGreenII 0800-LUC to generate D53\u2013GFP or\nD53\u2013LUC recombinant plasmids for transient expression assays, respectively.\nPlasmids DNA was prepared using the Plasmid Midi Kits (Qiagen) according\nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For preparation of rice protoplasts, the ster-\nilized seeds were germinated and grown in climate chambers for 7\u201310 days. Green\ntissues from the stem and sheath of 40\u201360 rice seedlings were used. The proto-\nplasts isolation and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) -mediated transfections procedure\nwere carried out as described previously50. GFP fluorescence fromprotoplasts was\nobserved and imaged as described above. For measurement of the relative luci-\nferase activity, protoplasts were incubated overnight and then treated with or\nwithout 5mM GR24 for 4 h. For MG132 treatment, 40 mMMG132 was added to\nthe sample and incubated for 1 h before addition of GR24. Activities of firefly\nluciferase (fLUC) and Renilla luciferase (rLUC) were determined with the Dual-\nGlo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The data were represented as the ratio of\nfLUC/rLUC activty.\n\n43. Liu, W. et al. Identification and characterization of HTD2: a novel gene\nnegatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice.

Previous reports have\ncorrelated the level of UEV1A expression with tumorigenesis; however, the detailed molecular events leading to\ntumors particularly breast cancer and metastasis are unclear. This study is to investigate roles of different UEV1 splicing\nvariants, and its close homolog MMS2, in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in breast cancer cells.\n\nMethods: We experimentally manipulated the UEV1 and MMS2 levels in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and\nmonitored their effects on cell invasion and migration, as well as tumor formation and metastasis in xenograft mice.\nThe underlying molecular mechanisms leading to metastasis were also examined.\n\nResults: It was found that overexpression of UEV1A alone, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is sufficient to induce cell invasion\nin vitro and metastasis in vivo. This process is mediated by NF-\u03baB activation and requires functional Ubc13. Our\nexperimental data establish that among NF-\u03baB target genes, UEV1A-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-1\n(MMP1) expression plays a critical role in cell invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, experimental depletion of UEV1 in\nMDA-MB-231 cells reduces MMP1 expression and prevents tumor formation and metastasis in a xenograft mouse\nmodel, while overexpression of MMP1 overrides the metastasis effects in UEV1-depleted cells.\n\nConclusions: These results identify UEV1A as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of metastasic breast\ncancers.\nIntroduction\nUEV1, also known as CROC1 [1] or CIR1 [2], encodes a\nubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme variant (Uev) [3]. It was\nalso identified as a mammalian homolog of yeast MMS2 [4]\nand as a co-factor of Ubc13 [5]. Indeed, a Uev (Uev1A or\nMms2) is absolutely required for Ubc13-mediated Lys(K)\n63-linked polyubiquitin chain assembly [5-9]. Despite their\nshared biochemical activity, Mms2 and Uev1A appear to\nfunction differently in mammalian cells: Ubc13-Mms2 is\nrequired for DNA-damage responses whereas Ubc13-\nUev1A is involved in nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation\n[10]. Previous studies implicate UEV1 as a potential proto-\n* Correspondence: wei.xiao@usask.ca\n1College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China 100048\n2Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, SK S7N 5E5, Canada\n\n\u00a9 2014 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd\nCommons Attribution License (http://creativec\nreproduction in any medium, provided the or\nDedication waiver (http://creativecommons.or\nunless otherwise stated.\noncogene. UEV1 was initially identified as a transactivator\nof the c-fos promoter [1]. It is downregulated when HT29-\nM6 colon cancer cells undergo chemical-induced differenti-\nation, and upregulated when Simian virus 40-transformed\nhuman embryonic kidney cells become immortal [2]. Fur-\nthermore, UEV1 is variably upregulated in all tumor cell\nlines examined [4], and maps to chromosome 20q13.2 [3],\na region where DNA amplification is frequently reported in\nbreast cancers [11-14] and other tumors [15], as well as in\nvirus-transformed immortal cells [16].\nUbc13-Uev1A is involved in NF-\u03baB activation\n\n[10,17,18] and inhibits stress-induced apoptosis in\nHepG2 cells [19].

It regulates a panel of genes that collectively play\npro-survival and anti-apoptotic roles [26,27]. It also controls\nthe expression of genes linked with invasion, angiogenesis,\nand metastasis of cancer, including the matrix metallopro-\nteinase (MMP) family [28,29] and chemokine (C-X-C motif)\nligand (CXCL) family genes [30,31]. Activation of NF-\u03baB is\na tightly regulated event. In normal cells, NF-\u03baB becomes\nactivated only after the appropriate stimulation, and then it\nupregulates the transcription of its target genes [24]. NF-\u03baB\nis activated by many divergent stimuli, including proinflam-\nmatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1b, epidermal growth\nfactor (EGF), T- and B-cell mitogens and bacterial lipopoly-\nsaccharides (LPS) [32]. Previous studies reported that the\nUev1A-Ubc13 heterodimer is involved in TNF receptor-\nassociated factor 6 (TRAF6) [17,33] and TRAF2-mediated\n[34] activation of NF-\u03baB, in which Ubc13-Uev1A probably\nserves as a unique Ubc/E2 along with TRAF proteins to\npolyubiquitinate NF-\u03baB essential modulator/inhibitor of \u03baB\nproteinkinase (NEMO/IKK\u03b3) [18,35] and/or Rieske iron-\nsulfur polypeptide 1(RIP1) [36] to activate I\u03baB kinase (IKK).\nActivated IKK leads to the phosphorylation and degradation\nof I\u03baB\u03b1, resulting in the release of NF-\u03baB RelA (p65) sub-\nunits to translocate into the nucleus [37].\nIn this study we demonstrate that in MDA-MB-231 breast\n\ncancer cells, the UEV1A transcript level is moderately ele-\nvated compared to normal breast cells. Overexpression\nof UEV1A alone in MDA-MB-231 cells is sufficient to\nactivate NF-\u043aB, which in turn upregulates the MMP1\nexpression to enhance breast cancer cell metastasis. More\nimportantly, experimental depletion of Uev1 in MDA-MB-\n231 cells reduces MMP1 expression and reduces their abil-\nity to grow tumors and metastasize in a xenograft mouse\nmodel. These observations provide the experimental and\ntheoretical cornerstone for therapeutic targeting of Uev1A\nin the treatment of metastatic breast cancers.\n\nMethods\nCell culture\nHuman breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7,\nMDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-\n436 and SK-BRIII were obtained from the American Type\nCulture Collection (ATCC, Manassan, VA, USA). The cells\nwere cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum essential medium\n(DMEM) (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicil-\nlin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2\natmosphere at 37\u00b0C. The MCF10A immortalized human\nmammary epithelial cells were obtained from ATCC and\ncultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10%\nhorse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml strepto-\nmycin (Invitrogen), 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,\nUSA), 100 ng/ml choleratoxin (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml hydro-\ncortisone (Sigma), and 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech). MDA-\nMB-231-TR stable cell lines were created by transfecting\nMDA-MB-231 cell lines with pLenti6-TR-lentivirus (Invi-\ntrogen) and selecting with 10 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen).\n\nPlasmids and pLentivirus vector preparation\nHuman MMS2, UEV1A, and UEV1C open reading frames\n(ORFs) were PCR-amplified as KpnI-XhoI fragments and\ncloned into the pcDNA4.0/TO/HA(+) plasmid vector.\nThe 1.9-kb human MMP1 promoter sequence [GenBank:\nAJ002550.1] was PCR-amplified as a KpnI-HindIII fragment\nand then cloned into the same sites of pGL4.2 (Invitrogen).\nThe NF-\u043aB target site was subsequently mutated by site-\ndirected mutagenesis using a quick-exchange method\n(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The sense primer for creat-\ning the NF-\u043aB binding site mutation is 5\u2032-AAAGG CAGAA\nGGGAA CCTCA AGAGG TTTTG AAGAG CCACC\nGTAAA GTGAG-3\u2032 (mutated sequence italicized). The\nmutated Ubc13-binding site (F38E) in Uev1A was designed\nbased on a previous study with Mms2-F13E [9]. The modi-\nfied sequence for UEV1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)\ndelivered by lentiviral particles was from Santa Cruz Bio-\ntechnology, Inc (Dallas, Texas, USA). The lentiviral particle\ninfection of breast cancer cells was performed following in-\nstructions of the supplier. The MMP1 and MMP9 small\ninterfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Gene-\npharma Co Ltd (Shanghai, China). The sequence for MMP1\nsiRNA is 5\u2032- GCGUGUGACAGUAAGCUAATT-3\u2032 and\nthat for MMP9 siRNA is 5\u2032-CGCUCAUGUACCC\nUAUGUATT-3\u2032.\n\nRNA preparation and real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was prepared from cultured breast cancer cells\nby using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was\nsynthesized from total RNA with SuperScript (Invitrogen)\naccording to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Briefly, luciferase reporter gene constructs (400 ng),\npcDNA-Uevs plasmids (400 ng) and the pRL-SV40\nRenilla luciferase construct (5 ng) (for normalization)\nwere co-transfected into the wells. Cell extracts were pre-\npared 48 hr after transfection and the luciferase activity\nwas measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay\nsystem (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nCells were grown to log phase and lysed in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS\n(150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 10 mM NaH2PO4,\npH 7.4) with 1% SDS and the protease inhibitor cocktail for\nmammalian cells (Sigma-Aldrich). Total protein concentra-\ntion was determined by the Bradford method using a com-\nmercial reagent from Bio-Rad. Cell extracts or purified\nproteins were electrophoresed in 10% or 15% SDS-\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, transferred\nto polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and incubated\nwith specific primary antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies\n(mAbs) LN2B (anti-Uev1) and 4E11 (anti-Ubc13) were\nfrom the laboratory stock [10,39]. Primary antibodies\nagainst HA (sc-7392), MMP1 (sc-30069), NF-\u03baB (sc-372),\nLamin B (sc-166729), \u03b2-tublin (sc-6216), and secondary\ngoat anti-mouse antibody IgG-horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP) (sc-2005) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2004)\nantibody were from Santa Cruz. The P-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody\n(#2859S) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Whitby,\nON, Canada), while an anti-MMP9 antibody (ab38898)\nwas from Abcam (Toronto, ON, Canada) and \u03b2-actin anti-\nbody (BM0627) was from Boster (Wunah, China).\n\nImmunoprecipitation\nWe immunoprecipitated 1 mg of protein samples in a total\nvolume of 1 ml with 2 \u03bcg of antibody and 20 \u03bcl of Protein-\nA beads (for rabbit polyclonal antibodies) or Protein-G\nbeads (for mouse monoclonal antibodies). The samples were\nrotated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The beads were washed 4 times\nwith 1 ml of cold NP40 lysis buffer containing protease in-\nhibitors. The beads were then boiled for 10 minutes in the\npresence of 25 \u03bcl 2 \u00d7 sample buffer and the released proteins\nfractionated by SDS-PAGE in 12% or 15% gels. Proteins\nwere detected by immunoblotting as described above.\n\nCell invasion and migration assays\nIn vitro invasion assays were conducted using Transwells\n(Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 8-\u03bcm-pore-size poly-\ncarbonate membrane filters in 24-well culture plates. The\nupper surface of the filter was coated with Matrigel\n(Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) in a volume of\n12.5 \u03bcl per filter. The Matrigel was dried and reconstituted\nat 37\u00b0C into a solid gel on the filter surface. The lower\nsurface of the filter was coated in fibronectin (20 \u03bcg/ml),\nvitronectin (10 \u03bcg/ml), collagen IV (50 \u03bcg/ml), or 10%\n(BSA)-DMEM as chemoattractants. After starving in BSA-\nfree DMEM overnight, 2 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded in the\nupper chamber. The cells were allowed to invade for 48 hr.\nCells that invaded the lower surface of the filter were\ncounted in five random fields under a light-microscope at\nhigh magnification. Experiments were conducted at least\nin triplicate. The in vitro cell migration ability was detected\nby wound healing assay or transwell assay without Matrigel\ncoating. The wound healing assay was performed by seed-\ning 2 \u00d7 105 cells onto 96-well plates. Confluent monolayers\nwere wounded using a pipette tip. After 48 hr the cell mi-\ngration distance was measured under a light-microscope at\nhigh magnification in at least three random fields. The\ntranswell assay without Matrigel was conducted using\nTranswells with 8-\u03bcm-pore-size polycarbonate membrane\nfilters in 24-well culture plates. The lower surface of the fil-\nter was coated with 10% BSA-DMEM as chemoattractants.\nAfter starving in a BSA-free DMEM medium overnight,\n5 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded in the upper chamber. Cells were\nallowed to invade for 6 to 36 hr and those migrated to the\nlower surface of the filter were counted in five random\nfields under a light-microscope at high magnification. Ex-\nperiments were conducted at least in triplicate.\n\nMetastasis assay in a xenograft mouse model\nThe experimental mouse work followed the animal care\nprotocol CNUAREB-2012002 approved by the Capital Nor-\nmal University Animal Research Ethics Board and was con-\nducted at the Peking University Health Science Center,\nChina. For the tumorigenesis assays, 5 \u00d7 106 breast cancer\ncells were injected subcutaneously into the lateral flanks of\n4- to 5-week-old BALB/c female nude mice. The palpable\ntumor diameters were measured once per week. Tumor\nlength (L) and width (W) were measured with a caliper, and\nthe volume (V) was calculated by the following equation:\n\nV \u00bc L\ufffdW2\ufffd \ufffd=2:\n\nThe mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after cell injection. For\nexperimental metastasis assays by intravenous (i.v.) injection,\n2 \u00d7 105 breast cancer cells were injected into the tail veins of\n\n\n\nWu et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 4 of 15\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75\nthe 4- to 5-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Endpoint\nassays were conducted 5 weeks after injection. Metastatic\nlung nodules 0.5 mm in diameter were counted. Analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analyses. To\nensure representative sampling of lung tumor nodules,\nfour sections were made per lung at various depths along\nthe coronal plane of the lung. The nodules per lung (four\nsections) were counted under a light-microscope.\n\nHistopathology\nFormalin-fixed lungs were paraffin-embedded, and tissue\nsections derived from tumor nodules or other tissues were\nstained with H&E to evaluate the morphology and inva-\nsiveness of breast cancer cells. Metastatic tumor nodules\nwere counted throughout the entire lung section at all\nthree depths under a light-microscope. Anti-Uev1A (LN1),\nanti-MMP1 (sc-30069) and NF-\u03baB p65 (sc-372) primary\nantibodies from Santa Cruz were used for immunohisto-\nchemistry (IHC). TissueFocus\u2122 breast cancer tissue micro-\narrays (CT565863) for IHC were obtained from Origene\n(Beijing, China). Microscopic images were captured by a\nSPOT digital camera mounted in a light-microscope.\n\nPreparation of nuclear fraction\nHeLa cells were treated with 40 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 for 2 hr.\nCells were washed, scraped with PBS, and centrifuged at\n3,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was suspended in 10 mM\nTris (pH 8.0) with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol,\nand 0.1% NP-40, and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Nu-\nclei were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at\n12,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The cytosolic superna-\ntants were removed and the precipitated pellets were sus-\npended in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCl\nand stored on ice for 30 minutes. After agitation for 30 mi-\nnutes at 4\u00b0C, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for\n15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was collected.\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)\nThe secquence of biotin-labelled sense NF-\u03baB probe for\nEMSA is 5\u2032-GAACCTCAGAGAACCCCGAAGAGCC-\n3\u2032. The cold probe is the same NF-\u03baB sequence without\nbiotin label. The sequence of biotin-labelled mutated\nsense NF-\u03baB probe is 5\u2032-GAA CCTCA AGAGGTTTTG\nAAGAGCC-3\u2032 (mutated sequence underlined): 1 ng of\nthe probe was incubated together with 10 to 20 \u03bcg of\ncell extracts or 5 to 10 \u03bcg of nuclear extracts for 30 mi-\nnutes at 25\u00b0C in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. The binding\nreaction was subsequently separated on a 5.5-7% poly-\nacrylamide gel in 1x Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (90 mM\nTris, 90 mM boric acid).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical significance of differential findings between\nthe experimental and control groups was determined by\nStudent\u2019s t-test as implemented by Microsoft Excel 2010\n(*P <0.05, **P <0.01 and ***P <0.001).\n\nResults\nAlternative UEV1 transcript levels in breast cancer cell\nlines and samples\nTwo major human UEV1 transcripts (UEV1A and UEV1B)\nwere previously reported [1]. It was determined that only\nUev1A, but not Uev1B, is able to physically interact with\nUbc13 and promote K63-linked polyubiquitination [10]. It\nturns out that Uev1B is excluded from the nucleus and in-\nvolved in endosomal trafficking [40]. Interestingly, data-\nbase analyses also indicate another splicing variant that\nwould encode a 147-amino acid Uev1 core domain, which\nwe name Uev1C (Figure 1A), the cellular function of which\nis currently unknown.\nWestern blot analysis of endogenous Uev1s using a\n\nUev1-specific monoclonal antibody LN2B [39] could only\ndetect Uev1C in several breast cancer cell lines including\nMDA-MB-231 and MCF7, and MCF10A, an immortalized\nnormal mammary epithelial cell line (Figure 1B). qRT-\nPCT analysis revealed that the relative transcript level\nof UEV1C is approximately 100-fold higher than that of\nUEV1A in the above cell lines (Figure 1C), consistent with\nobservations in other cell lines including HeLa and U2OS\n(data not shown).\nWe next examined relative transcript levels of UEV1A\n\nand UEV1C in breast cancer lines using MCF10A as a\nreference. Interestingly, the UEV1A transcript level is ele-\nvated in all breast cancer cell lines examined (Figure 1D),\nwith no significant upregulation of UEV1C (Figure 1E) or\nMMS2 (Additional file 2: Figure S1A) in these lines. It has\nbeen previously reported that the UEV1A level may be el-\nevated when normal cells undergo immortalization [2]. To\nfurther assess relative UEV1A expression in normal versus\nbreast tumor tissues, we measured the UEV1A tran-\nscript level in five normal human breast samples and 43\nbreast cancer samples from TissueScan microarrays.\nCompared with the five normal human breast samples,\n33/43 or 77% of breast cancer samples display UEV1A\nexpression above the highest UEV1A level in normal\nsamples, or at least 1.7-fold higher than the average level\namong the five normal samples (Additional file 2: Figure\nS1B), suggesting that Uev1A may play a role in promoting\nbreast tumorigenesis.\n\nOverexpression of UEV1A promotes breast cancer cell\ninvasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft model\nTo ask whether an elevated UEV1A level is indeed suffi-\ncient to promote breast cancer, UEV1A, UEV1C or MMS2\ngenes were cloned into a pcDNA4.0/TO/HA(+) vector\nand then transfected into MDA-MB-231-TR cells to con-\nstruct stable cell lines, and the level of ecotopic gene ex-\npression after 10 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline (Dox) treatment was\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (UEV)1A is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples.

These results suggest that UEV1A regulates breast\ncancer cell migration and invasion in vitro.\nAs an increased ability of cancer cells to migrate and\n\ninvade in vitro is a faithful indicator of cell metastasis, to\nfurther confirm the correlation between UEV1A expres-\nsion and breast cancer metastasis, we assessed the effects\nof UEV1A on metastasis using an in vivo xenograft mouse\nmodel. Stably-transfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells were\ninjected into the lateral flanks of 4- to 5-week-old BALB/c\nfemale nude mice and Dox (625 mg/kg) was added in\nfeed as soon as the cells were injected. Tumor growth\nand metastasis were then monitored. All mice (10/10)\ninjected with the UEV1A-expressing cells had massively\nenlarged lymph nodes containing invasive breast cancer\ncells (Figure 2F). In contrast, there were no tumor metas-\ntasis foci in lymph nodes of mice injected with vector\ncontrol or UEV1C-expressing cells, although some lymph\nnodes were enlarged (data not shown). Furthermore, over-\nexpression of UEV1A but not UEV1C accelerated tumor\ngrowth compared to vector-transfected cells (Figure 2G).\nIn the tail-vein injection groups, compared with UEV1C\nor vector control, overexpression of UEV1A significantly\npromoted lung metastasis colony fomation (Figure 2H,\nand I). These observations collectively demonstrate that\nelevated expression of UEV1A alone is sufficient to pro-\nmote tumor growth and metastasis.\n\nDepletion of Uev1 prevents breast cancer cell invasion\nin vitro and metastasis in nude mice\nCompared with MCF-10A cells, there was a 2.7-fold in-\ncrease in the UEV1A expression in MDA-MB-231 cells\n(Figure 1D). To ask whether this moderate overexpression\nof UEV1A contributes to breast cancer metastasis, the en-\ndogenous UEV1A expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was\nsuppressed using an shRNA (shUEV1) delivered by lenti-\nviral particles. It was found that two independent shUEV1\nconstructs, shUEV1-1 and shUEV1-2, reduced UEV1A ex-\npression to 40% and 55% of control shRNA-treated cells,\nrespectively (Figure 3A). As expected, the cellular UEV1C\nmRNA and protein levels were also reduced but MMS2\nremained unaffected (Additional file 2: Figure S5A-C).\nMoreover, partial depletion of Uev1 reduced cell migra-\ntion (Figure 3B and Additional file 2: Figure S5D) and in-\nvasion (Figure 3C and Additional file 2: Figure S5E). The\nabove findings were further extended by using a xenograft\nlung metastasis model, in which depletion of Uev1 limited\ntumor growth to the extent that no tumor was found in\nnude mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells in which the\nUev1 level was reduced by shUEV1-2 (Figure 3D and\nAdditional file 2: Figure S5F). Furthermore, depletion of\nUev1 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced the\nnumber of lung nodules formed in mice and completely\nabolished metastasis in lung, even with moderate deple-\ntion of Uev1 (Figure 3E, shUEV1-1, middle panel). These\nresults clearly indicate that the elevated UEV1A expres-\nsion in MDA-MB-231 cells plays a critical role in breast\ntumorigenesis and metastasis.\n\nOverexpression of UEV1A activates NF-\u03baB in MDA-MB-231\ncells in a Ubc13-dependent manner\nTo understand the mechanism by which Uev1A promotes\nmetastasis in breast cancer cells, we took into account that\nUev1A has been reported to activate NF-\u03baB in HepG2\n[19], and that NF-\u03baB regulates the expression of a large\nnumber of genes critical for tumorigenesis, inflammation\nand metastasis [41]. As a hallmark of NF-\u03baB activation is\nits translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, we\ntransfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells with a variety of con-\nstructs, induced the target gene expression by adding Dox,\nfractionated cells and then measured the subcellular distri-\nbution of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB. As seen in Figure 4A,\nonly overexpression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2,\nwas able to increase the phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB\ninhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 (presumably in the cytoplasm) and en-\nrich p65 in the nucleus. Consistently, depletion of Uev1\nby shRNA reduced I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and p65 nuclear\ntranslocation (Figure 4B).\nIt has been previously reported that Uev1A is a cofactor\n\nof Ubc13 in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [10,17]. To ask\nwhether the above Uev1A function is indeed dependent\non Ubc13, we created a Uev1A-F38E mutation as the cor-\nresponding Mms2-F12E mutation (Figure 1A) absolutely\nabolishes its interaction with Ubc13 and its ability to pro-\nmote Ubc13-mediated K63 polyubiquitination [9]. Indeed\nwe confirmed that the Uev1A-F38E substitution does not\naffect its expression (Additional file 2: Figure S2F) but\nabolishes its interaction with Ubc13 in vivo (Figure 4C).\nAs expected, overexpression of UEV1A-F38E failed to ac-\ntivate NF-\u03baB, as judged by a lack of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation\nand p65 nucleaar translocation (Figure 4D).\n\nMMP1 and MMP9 are tightly regulated by UEV1\nAs NF-\u03baB is a transcriptional factor that regulates the\nexpression of a large number of genes including those\ninvolved in metastasis, we measured the transcription of\nmany established or putative NF-\u03baB target genes thought\nto be involved in metastasis such as COX2 [42], VEGF\n[43] and MMP family genes, among which MMP1 and\nMMP9 transcripts were elevated by 4.6- and 3.9-fold, re-\nspectively, in UEV1A-overexpression cells, but not in UEV1C\nor MMS2 overexpression cells (Figure 5A,B), with corre-\nsponding elevation at proteins levels (Figure 5C). The\nobserved increase is completely dependent on Ubc13,\nas overexpression of UEV1A-F38E failed to induce\nMMP1 or MMP9 (Figure 5B). Similarly, depletion of\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Depletion of ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (Uev)1 reduces cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft mouse\nmodel.

Similarly, MMP1 depletion in UEV1A-\noverexpressed MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional file 2:\nFigure S6B) also decreased invasiveness (Additional file 2:\nFigure S6C and D). To ask whether overexpression of\nMMP1 is indeed sufficient to dictate MDA-MB-231 cell\ninvasion, we constructed an MMP1-expression plasmid\nand transfected it to MDA-MB-231 cells, which re-\nsulted in a 2.6-fold increase in the MMP1 transcript level\n(Additional file 2: Figure S6E) and a similar increase at the\nprotein level (Additional file 2: Figure S6F), as well as a\n2.3-fold increase in invasion (Figure 6C and Additional\nfile 2: Figure S6G). We then restored MMP1 level in\nUEV1-depleted cells to that of control cells (Figure 6D\nand E), which was sufficient to rescue the invasiveness in\nboth UEV1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Figure 6F).\nAs MMP1 is an important cancer cell metastasis factor\n[44-46], the above findings allow us to conclude that\nUEV1A regulates metastasis through tightly controlling\nMMP1 expression.\n\nUevA-Ubc13 control MMP1 expression by regulating NF-\u03baB\nTo ask whether Uev1A regulates MMP1 through NF-\u03baB,\nwe cloned the 1.8-kb human MMP1 promoter sequence\n(Figure 7A) into pGL4.2 and co-transfected it with plas-\nmids expressing UEV1A, UEV1A-F38E or an empty vector\ninto MDA-MB-231 cells. A luciferase assay showed that\nUEV1A expression activates the MMP1 promoter and that\nthis activation relies on its interaction with Ubc13, as the\nUev1A-F38E substitution completely abolished the activa-\ntion (Figure 7B). The predicted NF-\u03baB binding site (\u22121133\nto approximately \u22121125) in the MMP1 promoter was then\nmutated (Figure 7A) and the mutated reporter was used\nto co-transfect with plasmids expressing UEV1A, UEV1C,\nMMS2 or the empty vector into MDA-MB-231 cells.

It has been puzzling us that Uev1A and\nMms2 have different molecular weights and migrate\ndifferently; however, a monoclonal antibody capable of\nrecognizing both purified Uev1A and Mms2 only detects\na single band in western blot analysis, and siRNA deple-\ntion of either Mms2 or Uev1 only partially reduced the in-\ntensity of this band. A careful examination in this study\nreveals that in addition to the previously reported two\nUEV1 splicing variants UEV1A and UEV1B [1], cultured\n\n\n\nWu et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 13 of 15\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75\nhuman cells contain a novel UEV1 splicing variant, UEV1C,\nlacking the N-terminal 30 amino acid unique region of\nUev1A. The resulting 147-residue protein would co-\nmigrate with Mms2 during electrophoresis. It turns out\nthat the UEV1C transcript is much more abundant than\nUEV1A, and a Uev1-specific monoclonal antibody can de-\ntect cellular Uev1C but not Uev1A, unless the latter is ex-\nperimentally overexpressed.\nThe current study investigates roles of UEV1A, UEV1C\n\nand MMS2 in tumorigenesis using a breast cancer model.\nWith comparable levels of ectopic expression, it was\nfound that only UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is able\nto promote cell migration and invasion. Similarly, overex-\npression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C promotes tumor\ngrowth and metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. The\nabove results are highly reliable, as the target gene expres-\nsion is under tight regulation of a Tet-on promoter, and\nthe phenotypes were only observed under Dox-induced\nconditions. In a reverse experiment, depletion of Uev1 in\ncultured breast cancer cells significantly reduces cell mi-\ngration and invasion, as well as tumor growth and metas-\ntasis in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the\ncellular Uev1 (presumbly Uev1A) level plays a critical role\nin breast tumorigenesis and metastasis.\nTo understand the molecular mechanism by which\n\nUev1A promotes tumorigenesis, we demonstrated that\noverexpression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is\nable to promote I\u03baB\u03b1 phorsphorylation and NF-\u03baB trans-\nlocation into the nucleus, and that this effect absolutely re-\nlies on its physical interaction with Ubc13. It is conceivable\nthat as previously reported, the Ubc13-Uev1A heteromider\nserves as an E2 to assemble K63-linked poly-Ub chains\nalong with cognate really interesting new gene (RING)-\nfinger E3s like TRAF2 and/or TRAF6 [17,34], which\nrecruit K63 polyUb-binding proteins like NEMO [18]\nand TAB2/3 [47,48] to phorsphorylate and subsequently\ndegrade I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to NF-\u03baB activation.\nNF-\u03baB activation promotes the transcription of many\n\ndownstream genes in the signaling cascade [41]. However,\nthe moderate level of NF-\u03baB activation by UEV1A overex-\npression does not appear to induce all NF-\u03baB targeting\ngenes. To understand how overexpression of UEV1A leads\nto tumorigenesis and particularly metastasis in breast can-\ncer cells, we surveyed NF-\u03baB and metastasis-related genes\nand focused on two candidate genes, MMP1 and MMP9,\nboth of which are highly induced upon UEV1A overex-\npression. Experimental results as presented in this report\nindicate that both genes are tightly regulatd by cellular\nUev1 levels; however, depletion of MMP9 was not as ef-\nfective as that of MMP1 on cell migration and invasion.\nAs ecotopic expression of MMP1 to restore the wild-type\nlevel in Uev1-depleted cells also restored wild-type level\nof invasiveness, it is plausible to conclude that MMP1\nis the critical downstream effector of UEV1A-induced\nbreast cancer metastasis, although this study does not rule\nout the contributions of MMP9 and possibly other genes.\nThe signal transduction cascade of Uev1A\u2192NF-\u03baB\u2192\nMMP1\u2192metastasis is further confirmed by showing that\nUev1A-induced MMP1 expression is dependent on both\nUbc13 and the predicted NF-\u03baB binding site located in\nthe MMP1 promoter. Although this report only presents\ndata from one human breast cancer line, we have obtained\ncomparable results with a different breast cancer cell line\nMCF7 (data not shown), indicating that the tumorigenic\nand metastatic effects of Uev1A is a general phenomenon\nin breast cancers.\nWhile the experimental evidence as shown in this report\n\nclearly indicates that UEV1A can function as a proto-\noncogene, the clinical relevance of this finding awaits fu-\nture investigation. Nevertheless, our limited TissueScan\nmicroarray data indicate a low (less than 2-fold) variation\nin UEV1A transcript levels among five normal human\nbreast samples, compared with an increase of up to 20-\nfold in some breast cancer samples. As NF-\u03baB activation is\ncommonly observed in breast cancers [24,25,49] and\nUEV1 upregulation is also frequently observed in breast\ncancer samples [12-14] and in cultured tumor cell lines\n[4], and is found to be correlated to tumorigenic indicators\n[2,3], it is conceivable that a certain percentage of breast\ncancer samples with NF-\u03baB activation is due to elevated\nUEV1A expression.\nThis study demonstrated that the N-terminal region of\n\nUev1A is the molecular determinant of its cellular func-\ntion(s) in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Although the\nexact cellular function of Uev1C remains a mystery, our\nprevious studies [10] have shown that truncated Uev1A\nmissing the N-terminal 30 amino acids behaves like\nMms2 in terms of subcellular localization and promo-\ntion of K63-linked di-Ub versus poly-Ub chains in vitro,\nsuggesting that Uev1C may play an Mms2-related role.\nGiven the importance of Uev1 in signaling and tumori-\n\ngenesis, small-molecule inhibitors against Uev1 have been\nisolated [20,50] based on their interference with the Ubc13-\nUev1A interaction, and one appears to be able to inhibit\nproliferation and survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\ncells. It is unclear whether these inhibitors also interfere\nwith the Ubc13-Mms2 interaction, as critical residues\nresponaible for the heterdimer formation are conserved be-\ntween Uev1 and Mms2 [9]. Furthermore, this study pro-\nvides evidence that a desired inhibitor should target the\nN-terminal region of Uev1A instead of the Ubc13-Uev1\ninterface. Hence, this report provides an experimental and\ntheoretical cornerstone for future diagnosis and therapy\nby targeting Uev1A for the cure of breast cancer.\n\nConclusions\nAmong three Uev gene products, only Uev1A promotes\nbreast tumor metastasis, which is primarily through\n\n\n\nWu et al.

C6 glioma and\nhuman microvascular endothelial cells were treated with conditioned medium from cultures of glioma cells irradiated at a\nrange of doses and the migration of both cell types, tube formation by endothelial cells, as well as the expression and\nsecretion of migration-related proteins were evaluated. Exposure to X-ray radiation-conditioned medium induced dose-\ndependent increases in cell migration and tube formation, which were accompanied by an upregulation of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression. However, glioma cells treated with\nconditioned medium of cells irradiated at a carbon ion dose of 4.0 Gy showed a marked decrease in migratory potential and\nVEGF secretion relative to non-irradiated cells. The application of recombinant VEGF165 stimulated migration in glioma and\nendothelial cells, which was associated with increased FAK phosphorylation at Tyr861, suggesting that the suppression of\ncell migration by carbon ion radiation could be via VEGF-activated FAK signaling. Taken together, these findings indicate\nthat carbon ion may be superior to X-ray radiation for inhibiting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through modulation of\nVEGF level in the glioma microenvironment.\n\nCitation: Liu Y, Liu Y, Sun C, Gan L, Zhang L, et al.

Radiotherapy, a standard adjuvant\n\nto surgery, improves survival rates in patients, but resistance to\n\ntreatment by some gliomas limits the success of clinical application\n\n[2].\n\nHigh linear energy transfer (LET) heavy ions such as carbon\n\nions have attracted attention as alternatives to conventional\n\nradiation for radiotherapy\u2014particularly for tumors that are\n\nradiation-resistant under hypoxic conditions\u2014owing to their\n\nsuperior physical characteristics and high lethality for tumor cells\n\ncompared to low-LET radiation such as X- and c-rays [3\u20134]. Our\nown studies have shown that carbon ion radiotherapy offers a high\n\ndegree of control for targeting tumors and increases progression-\n\nfree survival rates without significant radiation-induced toxicity in\n\nskin carcinoma patients [5].\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment\n\ncontributes to radiation resistance [6] by regulating the levels of\n\ncytokines and growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth\n\nfactor (VEGF) [7], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [8], hepatocyte growth\n\nfactor (HGF) [9], and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [10], and\n\npromoting extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloprotei-\n\nnases (MMPs) [11].\n\nDue to the scarcity of particle accelerators that can produce\n\nheavy ion radiation, it has not yet been established whether carbon\n\nions can modify the glioma microenvironment and affect the\n\nmigratory behavior of cells during tumor progression and\n\nmetastasis. To address this question, the present study evaluated\n\nthe contribution of carbon ion radiation to the motility of glioma\n\nand endothelial cells using tumor-conditioned culture medium as\n\nan inducer.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell culture techniques\nC6 glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were\n\ngrown in Ham\u2019s F-12 media (Gibco, Invitrogen Crop, USA)\n\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone,\n\nChina). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1, Amer-\n\nican Type Culture Collection) were grown in a modified MCDB\n\n131 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) medium containing\n\n20% FBS and 1.0 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml\nhuman epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma). All cells were\n\ncultured in 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37uC.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0098448&domain=pdf\n\n\nIrradiation Procedure\nC6 glioma cells were irradiated by heavy ion beams and X-rays.\n\nCarbon ion irradiation was performed by the equipment at the\n\nHeavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR, Institute\n\nof Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou,\n\nChina). Glioma cells were exposed to carbon ion irradiation at\n\nenergy 350 MeV u21 and LET 15.4 keV mm21, with a dose rate\nof 0.5 Gy min21. X-rays were from a cabinet X-ray irradiation\n\nsystem (100 kpv, 3 mA, beryllium window thickness 0.76 mm,\n\nFaxitron X-ray corp.). The dose rate was set to about 1.3 Gy/min.\n\nThe film-to-source distance was set to 40.6 cm. Glioblastoma cells\n\nwere irradiated with 0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 Gy.\n\nTumor cell conditioned medium (TCM) and Irradiated\nconditioned medium (ICM) preparation\n\nTo generate TCM, C6 glioma cells were seeded at a density of\n\n56105 cells/25 cm2 culture flasks. At 90% confluence of cell\nmonolayer, culture medium was discarded to remove growth\n\nfactors. Thereafter, cells were rinsed with saline solution and fed\n\nwith fresh serum-free medium. TCM were collected from sham-\n\nirradiated cells considered as control conditioned medium. To\n\nobtain the ICM, cells were irradiated with carbon ion beams or X-\n\nrays under sterile conditions. And then irradiated cells were\n\nimmediately rinsed three times with saline solution and fed with\n\nfresh serum-free medium. After 24 h of incubation, the superna-\n\ntants was harvested and centrifuged at 20006g for 15 min and\npassed through a 0.22 mm filter to remove cells and cell debris.\nThis supernatant was stocked in 1.5 ml tubes and kept at 280uC.\n\nTranswell migration assays\nThe in vitro cell migration assays were performed by using a\n\nmodified Boyden chamber inserted with polyethylene terephthal-\n\nate filter membrane containing 8 mm pores in 24-well plates\n(Millipore, Milan, Italy). The upper chamber contained C6 glioma\n\ncells or HMEC-1 cells in serum-free culture medium, and the\n\nlower chamber contained TCM or ICM. After 24 h of incubation,\n\nmigrated cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 1 h and then\n\nstained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 10 min and images were\n\nprocessed using AxioVs40 software (Ver. 4.8.0.0, Carl Zeiss,\n\nGermany). Data were obtained by measuring ten randomly\n\nselected fields of transwell-migrated cells using Image-Pro Plus 6.0\n\nsoftware (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).\n\nGene expression analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted form glioma cells at 24 h after carbon\n\nion or X-ray irradiation using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life\n\nTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufactur-\n\ner\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg total RNA\nusing RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Tokyo, Japan)\n\nfollowing the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Real-time polymerase\n\nchain reaction (quantitative PCR) was carried out the SYBR\n\nPremix EX Taq II kit (Takara, China) on an FTC-3000+\ninstrument (Funglyn Biotech INC, Toronto, ON, Canada). Gene\n\nexpression was detected using qPCR primers for VEGF and b-\nactin which was used to normalize the mRNA and cDNA quantity\n\nand quality. Sequences of the primers are as follows: VEGF sense,\n\n59-GATCATGCGGATCAAACCTCACC-39, and antisense, 59-\n\nCCTCCGGACCCAAAGTGCTC-39; b-actin sense, 59-\nTGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGTGTGGAT-39, and antisense, 59-\n\nTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-39. The PCR program\n\nwas denatured at 95uC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for\n5 s, 60uC for 30 s. The fold changes of gene expression of the\ntreatment groups were calculated by the 2-DDCt method [12].\n\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay\nThe LDH leakage was determined by using commercially\n\navailable kits (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). The\n\ncells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed to release the\n\nintracellular LDH into the new supernatant at 24 h after exposure\n\nto radiation. The supernatant (120 ml) was mixed with 60 ml of\nLDH reagent solution, sheltered from light and incubated at room\n\ntemperature for 30 min. The LDH activity of the medium (LDH\n\nmedium) and the cell lysate (LDH cells) were determined using a\n\ncolorimetric assay at an absorbance wavelength of 490 nm and a\n\nreference wavelength of 630 nm using an Infinite M200 micro-\n\nplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland). The measured LDH activities\n\nwere calculated by percentage of LDH released in the supernatant\n\nto that of cell lysates from intact cells (% LDH released).\n\nWound-healing assay\nCells were seeded in a six-well plate at a concentration of 56105\n\nper well and allowed to form a confluent monolayer. The layer of\n\ncells was scratched with a 1000 ml micropipette tip. Cells were\nthen washed twice with fresh medium and replaced with TCM or\n\nICM. Cells migrated into the wounded area, and photographs\n\nwere taken immediately (0 h) and 24 h. The ability of cell motility\n\nwas calculated by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernet-\n\nics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) in the following way: the area\n\ncovered by the migrating cells (24 h)/the wound area (0 h).\n\nTube formation assay\n96-well plates were coated with 60 ml of Matrigel (BD\n\nBiosciences, San Jose, CA) and allowed to solidify at 37uC for\n1 h. After the Matrigel solidified, HMEC-1 endothelial cells\n\n(86105 cells/ml) were added in 200 ml of TCM or ICM. The cells\nwere incubated at 37uC with humidified 95% air/ 5% CO2 for\n8 h and photographed with the Carl Zeiss. Five randomly selected\n\nmicroscopic tube length was assayed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0\n\nsoftware (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).\n\nCytokine protein quantification\nWe measured tumor-derived secreted cytokines according to the\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. VEGF (ExCell Biology, Inc., Shang-\n\nhai, China), MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,\n\nChina) in the TCM or ICM of C6 glioma cells were detected by\n\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein sample preparation was basically performed as previ-\n\nously described [13]. Protein samples were load onto 10%\n\nacrylamide gels for Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel\n\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then the proteins were trans-\n\nferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore Corpo-\n\nration, USA). The membrane was blocked and subsequently\n\nincubated with anti-phospho-FAK antibody (Tyr861, Cell Signal-\n\ning Technology, MA, USA) and anti-b-actin antibody (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology Inc., USA). Secondary probes were detected by\n\nECL Western blot detection reagents (GE Healthcare, USA). And\n\nthe images were captured and analyzed by a FluorChem 2\n\nimaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA, USA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe results were expressed as means 6 standard error of the\n\nmean (SEM). Multiple comparisons were performed using one-\n\nway ANOVA followed by LSD as a post-hoc test. Statistical\n\ndifferences between the two groups were analyzed by Student\u2019s t-\n\nCarbon Ion Radiation Inhibits Cell Migration\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448\n\n\n\ntest. A p-value less than 0.05 was selected as a criterion for a\n\nstatistically significant difference.\n\nResults\n\nCancer cell migration and invasion into adjacent tissues, and\n\nintravasation into blood/lymphatic vessels are key events in\n\nmalignant tumor progression. To investigate the effect of radiation\n\non these processes, glioma and endothelial cells were treated with\n\nconditioned media from glioma cell cultures exposed to varying\n\ndoses of radiation. Tumor-conditioned media from cultures\n\nexposed to carbon ion radiation suppressed migration by 11.8%\n\nat 2.0 Gy and 17.4% at 4.0 Gy compared to control cells treated\n\nwith medium from unirradiated cultures after 24 h of exposure\n\n(Fig. 1A). In contrast, cell migration was markedly enhanced when\n\nmedia from X-ray-irradiated cultures was used as a chemoat-\n\ntractant (Fig. 1B).\n\nEndothelial cell migration is essential for angiogenesis, a process\n\nthat is closely associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progres-\n\nsion. HMEC-1 cells incubated with conditioned media from\n\ncarbon ion-irradiated cultures showed a decrease in migration at\n\n4.0 Gy compared to controls (Fig. 2A, C), while in cells incubated\n\nwith media from X-ray-irradiated cultures, a dose-dependent\n\nincrease in migration was observed compared to control cells\n\n(Fig. 2B).\n\nIn later stages of angiogenesis, endothelial cells self-assemble\n\ninto tubes to form new blood vessels. To investigate the effect of\n\nradiation on neovascularization, HMEC-1 cells were cultured on\n\nMatrigel-coated plates in the conditioned media. After an 8 h\n\nincubation, control cells formed tubular structures (Fig. 3A, B).\n\nCells cultured in media from X-ray-irradiated glioma cell cultures\n\nformed a greater number of capillary-like structures than control\n\ncells (Fig. 3B); however, cells exposed to media from heavy ion-\n\nirradiated cells formed fewer tubules than controls (Fig. 3C).\n\nVEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels in conditioned media from\n\ncultures of glioma cells treated with varying doses of X-ray or\n\ncarbon ion radiation were evaluated by ELISA. All three proteins\n\nwere present at higher levels in the media of X-ray-irradiated\n\ncultures than in unirradiated cell culture medium (Fig. 4). There\n\nwere no differences in the secretion of MMP-2 and -9 between\n\ncarbon ion-irradiated cells and controls; however, VEGF concen-\n\ntration was 17.5% lower in the medium of cells irradiated with\n\ncarbon ion at 4.0 Gy compared to the control culture (Fig. 4A).\n\nTo determine whether the altered levels of VEGF protein in\n\ntumor-conditioned media were due to transcriptional upregula-\n\ntion, the VEGF mRNA level in glioma cells was assessed by RT-\n\nFigure 1.

VEGF transcript levels in the 2.0, 4.0,\n\nand 8.0 Gy X-ray radiation groups were higher by approximately\n\n1.44-, 1.79-, and 2.66-fold relative to the control group (Fig. 5A).\n\nIn contrast, exposure to carbon ion radiation resulted in the\n\ndownregulation of VEGF gene expression at 4.0 (0.4660.09) and\n\n8.0 Gy (0.4860.09). LDH is a sensitive indicator of the metabolic\n\nstate of cells, and is rapidly released into the culture medium upon\n\ndamage to the plasma membrane. Irradiated glioma cells had\n\nhigher LDH activity in the medium compared to unirradiated\n\ncontrol cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, cells exposed to 8.0 Gy carbon ion\n\nradiation had increased LDH in the medium compared to those\n\nexposed to the lower doses of 2.0 and 4.0 Gy, indicating that\n\nhigher carbon ion radiation doses produced greater plasma\n\nmembrane damage.\n\nTo examine the functional significance of altered VEGF level in\n\nthe culture medium of irradiated tumor cells, conditioned media\n\nwere supplemented with recombinant VEGF165 (50 ng/ml) and\n\nthe effect on cell migration was evaluated by wound-healing assay.\n\nThe migration of HMEC-1 and C6 glioma cells was increased by\n\n1.31- and 1.58-fold, respectively, in the presence of VEGF165\n\n(Fig. 6C). Moreover, after a 4 h incubation in media from carbon\n\nion-irradiated cell cultures supplemented with VEGF165, both cell\n\ntypes showed increases in levels of phosphorylated FAK (Y861)\n\n(Fig. 6D).\n\nDiscussion\n\nRadiotherapy with or without surgery is a standard treatment\n\nfor malignant gliomas [14]. However, tumor cell responses to\n\nradiation are complex, with evidence suggesting that radiation\n\nfrom X- and c-rays not only cause the death of tumor cells, but\ncan alternatively lead to the emergence of greater aggressivity and\n\nmalignancy, allowing cells to escape the lethal effects of radiation\n\nand remain resistant to conventional therapy [15\u201316].\n\nHeavy ion radiation therapy has shown promise for the\n\ntreatment of head and neck cancers\u2014even those that are resistant\n\nto standard radiation by directly targeting the DNA of tumor cells\n\n[17\u201318]. In the present study, the effects of high LET carbon ion\n\nand low LET X-ray radiation on glioma and endothelial cell\n\nmigration were compared, using tumor-conditioned medium as an\n\ninducer. Media from cultures of C6 glioma cells exposed to 2.0 or\n\n4.0 Gy carbon ion radiation suppressed migration of both cell\n\ntypes (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that irradiation with heavy ions\n\ncan potentially attenuate the growth and metastasis of glioblasto-\n\nmas. In addition, the formation of endothelial cell tubules was\n\ninhibited upon incubation with the same conditioned medium\n\n(Fig. 3), implying that angiogenesis can be similarly blocked.\n\nCarbon ion radiation has been shown to suppress migration and\n\nthe formation of capillary-like tube structures in ECV304 and\n\nhuman umbilical vascular endothelial cells at a dose of 0.1 Gy\n\nFigure 2.

In contrast, conditioned media from tumor cells exposed to\n\nX-ray radiation stimulated cell migration and tube formation,\n\nconsistent with previous findings [20]. The migration and invasion\n\nof glioma cells into surrounding normal brain tissue and blood\n\nvessels contributes to the limited responsiveness of gliomas to\n\nconventional radiation treatments [21\u201322]. Thus, for resistant\n\ntumors, carbon ions can offer greater therapeutic effectiveness\n\ncompared to X-rays owing to the superior physical properties of\n\nhigh LET particles that transfer a greater amount of energy per\n\nunit length of track, which consequently increases the spatial\n\ndensity of energy deposition events [23].\n\nThe tumor microenvironment is dynamic and can be altered by\n\nradiation treatment. In accordance with earlier studies [20,24\u201325],\n\nthe present data showed that X-ray radiation enhanced the\n\nsecretion of VEGF, a potent angiogenic growth factor [26], as well\n\nas that of MMP-2 and -9, which degrade the basement membrane\n\nand extracellular matrix during tumor cell invasion and metastasis\n\n[27]. In contrast, VEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels were not\n\nsignificantly increased by carbon ion radiation; indeed, VEGF\n\nsecretion was reduced at 4.0 Gy (Fig. 4), implying that carbon ions\n\nmay suppress glioblastoma angiogenicity and tumorigenicity by\n\nmodulating VEGF production and release into the tumor\n\nmicroenvironment. However, the secreted VEGF induced by\n\ncarbon ion radiation was not dose-dependent, and reached a\n\nminimum at 4.0 Gy. One explanation for this observation is that\n\nthe expression of pro-angiogenic genes and disruption of tumor\n\ncell membrane integrity are largely determined by growth factor\n\nsecretion. Thus, although VEGF transcript expression was\n\nsuppressed at 4.0 and 8.0 Gy carbon ion radiation, the increase\n\nin the permeability of the cell membrane as reflected by LDH\n\nactivity in the culture medium was more obvious at 8.0 Gy,\n\nbecause damage to the plasma membrane at the higher radiation\n\ndose resulted in the release of proteins into the medium.\n\nTherefore, in view of the combined effects of above-mentioned\n\nfactors, the minimum production of VEGF in the conditioned\n\nmedium was exhibited at 4.0 Gy carbon-ion radiation group.\n\nTo identify the mechanism by which carbon ion radiation-\n\ninduced VEGF stimulates cell motility, cells were treated with\n\nrecombinant VEGF165 and the phosphorylation status of the\n\ndownstream factor FAK was examined. FAK is a non-receptor\n\ntyrosine kinase present at cell-cell contacts that is involved in\n\nintegrin-mediated signal transduction [28], and tyrosine phos-\n\nphorylation of FAK is required for cell migration [29\u201330]; VEGF\n\ninduces FAK phosphorylation at Y397, Y407, and Y861 [31\u201332].\n\nHere, the application of exogenous VEGF increased migration in\n\nendothelial and glioma cells concomitant with increased FAK\n\nphosphorylation at Y861 (Fig. 6), indicating that carbon ion\n\nradiation may promote the metastatic and angiogenic potential of\n\ntumors through VEGF/FAK signaling.\n\nIn summary, the present results demonstrate that high-LET\n\ncarbon ion radiation is superior to low-LET X-rays for suppressing\n\nthe migration of glioma and endothelial cells, and thus inhibiting\n\ntumorigenesis and angiogenesis via regulation of VEGF-mediated\n\nsignaling in the tumor microenvironment. These findings provide\n\nevidence in favor of carbon ion over X-ray radiation for the\n\ntreatment of tumors that are resistant to conventional radiother-\n\nFigure 3.

This ability to respond to environmental daily rhythms has been conserved along evolution, and it is\nfound among species from bacteria to mammals. The hematopoietic process of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is under\ncircadian control and is tightly regulated by astakines, a new family of cytokines sharing a prokineticin (PROK) domain. The\nexpression of AST1 and AST2 are light-dependent, and this suggests an evolutionarily conserved function for PROK domain\nproteins in mediating circadian rhythms. Vertebrate PROKs are transmitters of circadian rhythms of the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus (SCN) in the brain of mammals, but the mechanism by which they function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that\nhigh AST2 expression is induced by melatonin in the brain. We identify RACK1 as a binding protein of AST2 and further\nprovide evidence that a complex between AST2 and RACK1 functions as a negative-feedback regulator of the circadian\nclock. By DNA mobility shift assay, we showed that the AST2-RACK1 complex will interfere with the binding between BMAL1\nand CLK and inhibit the E-box binding activity of the complex BMAL1-CLK. Finally, we demonstrate by gene knockdown that\nAST2 is necessary for melatonin-induced inhibition of the complex formation between BMAL1 and CLK during the dark\nperiod. In summary, we provide evidence that melatonin regulates AST2 expression and thereby affects the core clock of\nthe crustacean brain. This process may be very important in all animals that have AST2 molecules, i.e. spiders, ticks,\ncrustaceans, scorpions, several insect groups such as Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Blattodea, but not Diptera and\nColeoptera. Our findings further reveal an ancient evolutionary role for the prokineticin superfamily protein that links\nmelatonin to direct regulation of the core clock gene feedback loops.\n\nCitation: Watthanasurorot A, Saelee N, Phongdara A, Roytrakul S, Jiravanichpaisal P, et al.

Clock genes and hormones are\n\ncore regulators or pacemakers in circadian regulation, which\n\nreside in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals and the\n\nbrain visual center in insects [2,3]. In Drosophila, the proteins\n\nencoded by clock genes form two distinct heterodimers: Period\n\n(PER) and Timeless (TIM) form one heterodimer, and Clock\n\n(CLK) and Cycle (CYC) form the other [4]. In mammals, the\n\nhomologues of the CLK and PER proteins have the same name,\n\nwhile the homologues of TIM and CYC are called cryptochrome\n\n(CRY) and brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear\n\ntranslocator (ARNT)-like 1 (BMAL1) respectively [5]. The PER-\n\nTIM heterodimer functions as an autoregulatory negative\n\nfeedback loop that causes a decrease in transcriptional activation\n\nby CLK and CYC [6]. Conversely, the CLK-CYC heterodimer\n\ndirectly interacts with the upstream E-boxes (CACGTG) of the\n\nPER and TIM genes to activate their transcription [7]. These clock\n\ngenes are detected in several neural and non-neural tissues,\n\nsuggesting that these feedback loops are not restricted to neurons\n\n[8]. RACK1 was recently identified as an inhibitor of mammalian\n\nCLK-BMAL1 activity by recruiting PKCa during the negative\nfeedback phase of the cycle [9].\n\nAs described above, the SCN serves as the \u2018\u2018master clock\u2019\u2019 in the\n\nmammalian brain [10]. The SCN is reset on a circadian basis by\n\nlight input from the retina during the day and by melatonin\n\nsecretion from the pineal gland at night [11,12]. Several animal\n\nstudies have documented that melatonin is mainly synthesized and\n\nreleased during darkness, while the melatonin level is low in the\n\npresence of light [13]. This hormone is formed not only in the\n\npineal gland but also in the photoreceptive structures of both\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nvertebrates and invertebrates [14]. The melatonin synthesis\n\npattern is known to reflect both daily rhythms and changes in\n\nphotoperiod, demonstrating that melatonin has major roles in\n\nregulating both circadian and seasonal rhythms [15]. Several\n\ncircadian rhythms, such as the rest/activity cycle, core body\n\ntemperature, neuronal electrical activity and locomotor activity,\n\nare driven by melatonin [16,17,18,19]. However, melatonin does\n\nnot directly induce immediate changes in clock gene mRNA\n\nexpression in the rat SCN, suggesting that the phase-shifting effect\n\nof melatonin on the SCN molecular loop implicates a post-\n\ntranslational rather than a transcriptional effect [15]. Little is\n\nknown about the molecular mechanism by which melatonin drives\n\nthe clock gene feedback loops in the SCN. In addition, the\n\nnocturnal increase in the circadian secretion of the cytokine IL-2\n\nand its immunobiological activity are under melatonin control\n\nduring the dark period [20]. There is a link between the rest/\n\nactivity cycle and the immune system via melatonin-cytokine\n\ninteractions [21].\n\nNeuronal tissues that contain circadian clocks are present in the\n\nbrain of the crayfish Cherax destructor and Procambarus clarkii, the\n\nlatter of which is highly related to Pacifastacus leniusculus. These\n\nspecies have photoreceptor cells not only within their eyes, but also\n\nin extraretinal parts of the brain. In Cherax this area is located in\n\nthe anterior median brain soma cluster 6 [22], and the axons from\n\nthese cells terminate in an area within the protocerebral bridge\n\n[23]. It is clear that these brain photoreceptors are sufficient to\n\nmaintain the circadian locomotor rhythm in these animals [23].\n\nThese areas have also recently been shown to be immunoreactive\n\nfor proteins encoded by the clock genes CLK, PER and TIM [24].\n\nSeveral studies imply a conserved role of melatonin as an\n\nimportant transducer of circadian information in invertebrates\n\nand vertebrates, and melatonin production has been demonstrated\n\nin the eyestalks of several crustacean species [25,26]. The presence\n\nof MT2 melatonin receptors have not been conclusively shown in\n\ncrayfish, but indirect evidences for such a receptor were presented\n\nby Mendoza-Vargas et al [27] since the application of the MT2\n\nreceptor selective agonist 8-M-PDOT or antagonist DH97 had a\n\nsignificant effect on how melatonin affected the retinal photore-\n\nceptors [27].\n\nIn mammals, the secretion of prokineticin 2 (PROK2) by the\n\nSCN is implicated in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle and\n\nlocomotor activity and is known to suppress the function of\n\nmelatonin [28]. The transcription of PROK2 is activated by the\n\nCLK-BMAL1 heterodimer and light [29,30].\n\nCrayfish astakines are invertebrate homologues of the prokine-\n\nticins (PROK), and there are two forms in the crayfish P.\n\nleniusculus: astakine 1 (AST1, AAX14635) and astakine 2 (AST2,\n\nEF568370) [31]. These astakines have been identified in several\n\ninvertebrates, and similar to PROK2, the expression profiles of\n\ncrayfish AST1 and AST2 follow a daily rhythm [32]. In contrast to\n\nAST1, the rhythmic expression of AST2 is at its maximum level in\n\nthe dark phase [32]. Although the patterns of melatonin and AST2\n\nrelease are circadian-regulated in crayfish [32,33], nothing is\n\nknown about their role in regulating rhythmic oscillations. In this\n\nstudy, we provide evidence that melatonin regulates the circadian\n\nrhythm and that this regulation is mediated by AST2 during the\n\ndark phase. Our results imply that AST2 acts as novel negative\n\nfeedback regulator of CLK-BMAL1 activity.\n\nResults\n\nMelatonin induces the expression of AST2\nIn a recent report, we showed that AST2 mRNA is expressed in\n\nthe hematopoietic tissue (HPT) of P. leniusculus at higher levels at\n\nnight than during the day, the time when melatonin is also at a\n\nhigh level [32,33]. Thus, we hypothesized that there may be a\n\nphysiological link between these two molecules. We examined the\n\nexpression of AST1 and AST2 in HPT cells incubated with\n\nmelatonin in vitro (Figure 1A\u20131B) and in HPT, hemocytes and\n\nbrain injected with melatonin in vivo (Figure 1C\u20131H). Melatonin\n\nincubation or injection clearly affected AST2 expression\n\n(Figure 1B, 1D, 1F and 1H), whereas AST1 expression was\n\nunaffected by this treatment (Figure 1A, 1C, 1E and 1G). These\n\nresults were also confirmed at the level of translation using an\n\nELISA assay (Figure 2A\u20132C), in which melatonin treatment\n\nresulted in higher levels of the AST2 protein. When cell lysates\n\nfrom the brain and HPT were analyzed by western blot at 9:00\n\nand 20:00, respectively, the level of AST2 was clearly higher at\n\nnight than during the day (Figure 2D).\n\nAST2 binds to PlRACK1\nIn contrast to AST1, which is a secreted protein, AST2 is\n\nmainly an intracellular protein (Figure S1). To identify any protein\n\nthat interacts with AST2 in HPT cells, recombinant AST2 (GST-\n\nAST2) was used as a bait to bind to proteins in HPT and hemocyte\n\nlysates by far overlay or pull-down assays (Figure 3A\u20133B). After\n\nexcluding the background proteins found in the control, a protein\n\nwith high similarity to Penaeus monodon RACK1 was identified as an\n\nAST2-binding protein by mass spectra analysis. The Mascot\n\nsearch resulted in significant hits where P. monodon RACK1 had\n\nthe highest significant protein score 781 (Table S1). This protein\n\nwas the significant hit detected in both the far overlay and the\n\nGST pull-down assay.\n\nBy designing degenerate primers from the obtained amino acid\n\nsequences, a complete RACK1 cDNA was identified by RACE\n\ntechnique from P. leniusculus (PlRACK1). The open reading frame\n\nof PlRACK1 contains 957 bp (JQ686053), encoding 318 amino\n\nacids with a calculated molecular mass of 35.7 kDa (predicted\n\nMW using ProtParam program), and its deduced amino acid\n\nsequence was found to consist of seven conserved WD40 repeat\n\nbinding sites (Figure S2). PlRACK1 mRNA was highly expressed\n\nin different crayfish tissues (Figure S3). To confirm the interaction\n\nbetween PlRACK1 and AST2, recombinant GST-PlRACK1 was\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nMost living organisms are able to sense the time and in\nparticular time of day by their internal clocks. So-called\nclock proteins control these internal clockworks. BMAL1\nand CLK are two important clock proteins, which together\nform a complex that serves as a transcription factor and\ncontrols the production of diurnal proteins. These diurnal\nproteins, in turn, inhibit the formation of clock proteins so\nthat the concentration of the different proteins in the cell\noscillates back and forth throughout the day. External\nfactors may affect the balance of clock proteins, and one\nsuch important factor is light. Melatonin is a darkness\nhormone produced in the brain of most animals during\nthe night, and here we show that melatonin controls the\nformation of a protein named AST2 in crayfish. AST2\nbelongs to a group of proteins found in many arthropods,\nsuch as spiders, scorpions, crustaceans, and some insects,\nwhose function has been unknown until now. Now we\ndemonstrate that AST2 is induced by melatonin at night\nand then functions in the internal biological clock by\npreventing BMAL1 and CLK to form a complex. In this way,\nAST2 acts as a link between melatonin and the internal\nbiological clock.\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

The GST-PlRACK1 was used in an in vitro binding\n\nassay with a His-Trx-AST2 fusion protein (predicted mass of\n\n33 kDa). The His-Trx and GST proteins were also expressed and\n\npurified to serve as control proteins (Figure S5B: the predicted\n\nmass of His-Trx and GST proteins are 20 and 26 kDa,\n\nrespectively). As shown in Figure 3C, western blot analysis\n\nrevealed that the His-Trx-AST2 protein was pulled down by\n\nGST- PlRACK1, but not by GST alone. These data indicate that\n\nthere is an interaction between PlRACK1 and AST2.\n\nPlBMAL1 forms a complex with PlRACK1\nThe finding that PlRACK1 is a binding partner of the\n\nmelatonin-induced protein AST2 led us to examine whether\n\nPlRACK1 associates with BMAL1 to thereby act as a regulator of\n\ncircadian rhythm, as has recently been reported in mice [9].\n\nBMAL1 cDNA was amplified from P. leniusculus (PlBMAL1,\n\nJQ670886) with an open reading frame of 1,995 bp that encodes a\n\n664 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of\n\n73.64 kDa. One close sequence to PlBMAL1 was that of BMAL1\n\nfrom Drosophila melanogaster (identity = 55%). Domain homology\n\nanalysis using SMART revealed that the deduced amino acid\n\nsequence was highly conserved in its HLH (helix-loop-helix) DNA-\n\nbinding domain and the protein dimerization PAS and PAC\n\nregions (Figure S4A). The expression of PlBMAL1 was highest in\n\nhemocytes, followed by testis, nerve, intestine and brain (Figure\n\nS4B). An interaction between PlBMAL1 and PlRACK1 was\n\ndemonstrated using a GST pull-down experiment with recombi-\n\nnant GST-PlRACK1 (predicted mass of 62 kDa) and His-Trx-\n\nPlBMAL1 (predicted mass of 94 kDa as shown in Figure S6A\u2013\n\nS6B). This in vitro GST pull-down assay showed an apparent\n\nbinding between these two recombinant proteins (Figure 4A). The\n\nfar western blotting using PlRACK1 without GST tag (predicted\n\nmass of 36 kDa) as a prey and GST- PlBMAL1 (predicted mass of\n\n100 kDa as shown in Figure S6C) as bait, also confirmed this\n\ninteraction (Figure 4B). The results show that the GST-PlBMAL1\n\nwas detected at the place where the PlRACK1 was located,\n\nwhereas the GST control protein could not be detected. Binding of\n\nPlRACK1 to AST2 as well as to PlBMAL1 was detected using far\n\nwestern after SDS-PAGE at reducing condition. The crystal\n\nstructure of human RACK1, with high homology to PlRACK1, is\n\nknown as a sevenfold \u00df-propeller structure [34]. A comparison of\n\nthe structure of human RACK1 with yeast RACK1 (that lacks\n\nmost of the cysteines present in animal RACK1\u2019s) show a high\n\nsimilarity in the overall structure, indicating that the cysteines are\n\nof minor importance for the main structure characteristics of this\n\ngroup of proteins, which may explain retained binding properties\n\nin the far western assay.\n\nInteraction of AST2 with PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 in vitro\nTo investigate if and how AST2 regulates an oscillatory\n\nmechanism, we examined whether AST2 interacts with the\n\nPlBMAL1-PlRACK1 complex. This interaction is mediated by\n\nAST2 binding to PlRACK1, since we could show that AST2 is not\n\nable to bind to BMAL1 alone (Figure S7). The results from GST\n\npull-down experiments showed that recombinant His-Trx-AST2\n\nstrongly associated with the recombinant GST-PlRACK1/His-\n\nTrx-PlBMAL1 complex, and the binding of His-Trx-PlBMAL1\n\nand His-Trx-AST2 was dependent on the concentration of GST-\n\nPlRACK1 (Figure 4C). These results suggest that AST2 plays an\n\nessential role as a stabilizer of the PlBMAL1-PlRACK1 complex,\n\nthereby suppressing the CLK-BMAL1 interaction during the dark\n\nperiod.\n\nAST2 associates to form an AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1\ncomplex during the dark period in vivo\n\nThe amount of AST2 protein varies in a circadian manner and\n\nis highest during early night in the brain and HPT, while\n\nPlBMAL1 and PlRACK1 protein levels do not change signifi-\n\ncantly according to daily rhythms (Figure 5A\u20135B). Because our in\n\nvitro experiments indicated an interaction between AST2 and\n\nPlRACK1 and between PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1, we confirmed\n\nthese two interactions with in vivo experiments. To study the in vivo\n\ninteractions between these three proteins during the light and dark\n\nperiods, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments of brain\n\nand HPT extracts. A high-molecular-weight complex was present\n\nat night and disappeared during the day, as shown in Figure 5C\n\nand 5D. This complex was abundant in the brain; it was also\n\nfound at very low levels in a few HPT samples (Figure 5C).\n\nReducing SDS-PAGE revealed that AST2, PlBMAL1 and\n\nPlRACK1 were components of this approximately 200 kDa\n\ncomplex (Figure 5C) (the native mass of these three proteins are\n\n14, 74 and 36 kDa, respectively). During the light period, this high\n\nmolecular weight complex could not be detected; instead, a\n\nsmaller complex of AST2-PlRACK1 was identified (Figure 5D).\n\nThe CLK protein is detected as a component of the 400-\nkDa complex\n\nTo determine whether CLK (JQ670885) forms a complex with\n\nBMAL1, crayfish brain lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitat-\n\ned with antibodies against BMAL1 and probed for CLK. The\n\nCLK protein with a molecular mass of 95 kDa clearly coimmu-\n\nnoprecipitated with endogenous PlBMAL1 (Figure 6A), indicating\n\nthat CLK is one protein component of this large approximately\n\n400 kDa complex. Confirmation of complex formation was\n\naccomplished by switching the antibodies used for immunopre-\n\ncipitation and for western blot detection, respectively (Figure 6A).\n\nWe then monitored the CLK protein levels in the brain during the\n\nday and night by western blotting. As shown in Figure 6B, the\n\nCLK protein level oscillated in a circadian rhythm, and its\n\nexpression peaked in the light period (Figure 6F). Furthermore, the\n\napproximately 400 kDa CLK-PlBMAL1 complex was barely\n\ndetectable at night and reached maximal levels in the morning\n\n(Figure 6B and 6C). More interestingly, the lowest level of the\n\nCLK-PlBMAL1 complex in brain lysates coincided with the time\n\nbars = control.

As\n\nshown in Figure 7A and 7B, AST2 expression could be partly\n\ndecreased in the brain by injection of dsRNA. A reduction of the\n\napproximately 200 kDa complex occurred during the night as a\n\nresult of this AST2 deficiency when compared to injection of the\n\ndsGFP control (Figure 7C and 7E). In contrast to the control\n\ngroup, the formation of the <400 kDa complex in AST2-silenced\nanimals occurred at 21:00, as shown in Figure 7C and 7D. Thus,\n\nthis experiment further confirms that AST2 is required to interfere\n\nwith the formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1 heterodimer, and that\n\nhigh AST2 levels at night cause lower amounts of CLK-PlBMAL1\n\nheterodimer formation during the dark period (Figure 7C\u20137G).\n\nAST2 gene knockdown induces CLK/BMAL1 E-box\nbinding in the dark\n\nSince knockdown of AST2 resulted in more CLK-PlBMAL1\n\ncomplex formation during the dark period, we decided to test\n\nwhether AST2 also had an effect on CLK-PlBMAL1 E-box\n\nbinding. We assayed the CLK-PlBMAL1 E-box binding by a\n\nDNA-protein binding assay. As expected, we could demonstrate\n\nCLK-PlBMAL1 specific E-box binding during the night in AST2\n\nsilenced animals, whereas the control group (dsGFP) did not show\n\nany E-box binding in the dark (Figure 8A\u20138B). A super shift of this\n\nE-box binding was induced after incubation with anti-CLK\n\nantibodies (Figure 8A), and controls using mutated or unlabelled\n\nE-box oligonucleotides did not show any binding (Figure 8B and\n\nFigure S8A\u2013S8B). In contrast, melatonin injection during the day\n\n(which leads to enhanced levels of AST2, Figure 2A) reduced the\n\nDNA binding activity of CLK-PlBMAL1 compared to other\n\ngroups (Figure S8B). The complex formation of CLK-PlBMAL1\n\nor AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 was followed by western blotting\n\nafter knockdown of AST2 expression by dsRNA or increasing\n\nAST2 by addition of melatonin (Figure 8C\u20138E). These results\n\nreveal that AST2 is an important regulator of the E-box binding\n\nactivity of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex.\n\nDiscussion\n\nVarious proteins are regulated by the circadian rhythm, and\n\nthere are a growing number of examples of circadian regulation of\n\nstem cell activities, such as the proliferation and recruitment of\n\nhematopoietic progenitor cells [33,35]. We have recently shown\n\nthat the hematopoietic cytokine AST1 is regulated by light and that\n\nthis regulation has an impact on hemocyte synthesis [26]. AST1\n\ncontains a prokineticin domain (pfam06607) and shares similarities\n\nwith vertebrate PROK2, which is regulated by light at the\n\ntranscriptional level by core clock genes [22]. Apart from\n\nfunctioning in circadian clocks, vertebrate PROKs have document-\n\ned roles in the regulation of intestinal muscle contractility,\n\nneurogenesis, pain perception, food uptake, and appetite regulation\n\n[36,37]. In similarity with invertebrate astakines the vertebrate\n\nPROKs also play roles in hematopoiesis and proinflammatory\n\nimmune responses. Therefore, the structural and functional\n\nsimilarities between astakines and the vertebrate PROKs point to\n\nan ancient similar role for these proteins [38].\n\nThe oscillation in PROK2 transcription in mice occurs in the\n\nSCN, and it acts as an output molecule, signaling the rhythm to\n\nother cells and tissues and thereby changing circadian behavior\n\n[39]. Signal transduction from vertebrate PROK\u2019s are mediated\n\nby two closely related G-protein coupled receptors, and the AVIT\n\nmotif has been shown to be crucial to this receptor binding and the\n\nactivity of the PROK\u2019s [40]. An analysis of the gene structure for\n\nhuman PROK2 reveals that exon 2\u20134 share similarities to crayfish\n\nAST2, while the first exon encodes the signal peptide and the\n\nAVIT motif [41,42]. Thus, all invertebrate astakines found so far,\n\ndiffer from the vertebrates PROKs in their N-terminal and lack of\n\nthe AVIT-motif [25] a fact that indicates different receptor\n\nbinding properties for this invertebrate group of PROK domain\n\ncontaining proteins. Similar to PROK2, AST1 is a secreted\n\nmolecule with circadian expression, and these data indicate a\n\nconserved role for this domain throughout evolution, from\n\narthropods to humans [25,26]. In this study, we report a more\n\ndirect role for another crayfish prokineticin, namely AST2, as an\n\nintracellular regulator of the heterodimeric transcription factors\n\nCLK and PlBMAL1. The expression of AST2 does not exhibit a\n\nlight-dependent pattern that is similar to that of AST1 or PROK2\n\nin mice; instead, we detected high levels of AST2 expression in the\n\nHPT and brain during the dark period when melatonin levels are\n\nhigh. We also showed that melatonin administration clearly\n\nincreased the expression of AST2 at both the mRNA and protein\n\nlevels.\n\nIt is well established that the neurohormone melatonin has an\n\nimportant function in the SCN in regulating the feedback loop of\n\nthe core clock genes and also functions as an output signal that has\n\nan effect on peripheral cells [43]. Melatonin is mainly produced\n\nwithin the eyestalks of crayfish, and its production is elevated\n\nduring the dark period [27]. Melatonin is known to influence\n\nnumerous physiological processes in crayfish [18,33,44], although\n\nthe molecular mechanism by which melatonin exerts its effect has\n\nnot been fully clarified. However, AST2 is an intracellular protein\n\nthat is present in several crustaceans and insect species [25]. Here,\n\nfor the first time, we identify a direct role for AST2 in the\n\nregulation of the circadian clock and show that the protein acts as\n\na link between melatonin and the heterodimeric transcriptional\n\nactivator CLK-PlBMAL1. Intracellular PlRACK1 was identified\n\nas an AST2-binding protein, and in the brain, the binding of\n\nPlBMAL1 to this complex mediated a decrease in the formation of\n\nthe CLK-PlBMAL1 heterodimer. This process may be very\n\nimportant in all animals that have AST2 molecules i.e., spiders,\n\nticks, crustaceans, scorpions, several insect groups such as\n\nHymenoptera, Hemiptera, Blattodea but not Diptera and\n\nColeoptera. If any vertebrate PROK is performing the same\n\nfunction still remains to be demonstrated.\n\nRecently, RACK1 and protein kinase Ca (PKCa) were shown\nto interact with BMAL1 in a circadian manner, resulting in\n\nsuppressed CLK-BMAL1 activity [9]. This result is consistent with\n\nour observation of the PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 interaction in the\n\ncrayfish brain. At night, we detected an approximately 200 kDa\n\ncomplex in the crayfish brain and found that the components of\n\nthis complex consisted of AST2, PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1.\n\nand 8; GST pull-down of His-Trx. B) The protein-protein interaction of PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1 was analyzed by far western blotting. C) Binding of AST2\nand PlBMAL1 to GST-PlRACK1. GST-PlRACK1 (0, 5, 50 or 500 ng) was bound to Glutathione Sepharose beads and incubated with 500 ng His-Trx-\nPlBMAL1 and 500 ng His-Trx-AST2. Bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted for PlBMAL1 and AST2 using an anti-His antibody and for\nPlRACK1 with an anti-GST antibody.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003361.g004\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 8 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 9 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nConversely, this complex disappeared during the light period due\n\nto lower levels of AST2 during the day. Thus, our results show that\n\nAST2 acts as a regulator of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex by\n\nbinding to PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 in an oscillatory manner that is\n\ninduced by changes in the level of melatonin.\n\nInterestingly, enhancement of the approximately 400 kDa\n\ncomplex consisting of PlBMAL1 and CLK was detected when the\n\nlevel of the approximately 200 kDa complex was decreased either\n\nduring the light period or by knockdown of AST2 expression. A\n\nsimilar high-molecular-weight complex of PlBMAL1 and CLK\n\n(approximately 400 kDa) was also recently detected in mice [9].\n\nThe formation of the approximately 400 kDa crayfish complex is\n\ndependent on the expression of CLK. The expression of mamma-\n\nlian CLK is not rhythmic [45,46], while zebrafish CLK shows\n\nrobust rhythmic expression, as was the case for crayfish CLK in our\n\nstudy [47,48,49]. As with zebrafish and Drosophila, the CLK of\n\ncrayfish is directly regulated by light [50,51]. Unlike those in\n\nmammals, the protein products of PER and TIM (or CRY in\n\nmammals) in Drosophila act to inhibit the transcriptional activity of\n\nthe CLK-CYC complex (CLK-BMAL1) by interacting with CLK\n\nor a CLK-containing complex during the night but not during most\n\nof the day [52]. In our experiments, the AST2-PlRACK1-\n\nPlBMAL1 complex (approximately 200 kDa) competes for binding\n\nto PlBMAL1 to interfere with the formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1\n\nheterodimer during the dark period. Further it is clear from our\n\nDNA mobility shift assay that AST2 can inhibit the transcriptional\n\nactivation activity of CLK-PlBMAL1. This 200 kDa AST2-\n\ncontaining complex directly interacts with different proteins and is\n\nclearly induced by melatonin. Therefore, our findings reveal an\n\nancient evolutionary role for a prokineticin superfamily protein that\n\nlinks melatonin to direct regulation of the core clock gene feedback\n\nloops, as indicated in the model (Figure 9).\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCrayfish\nHealthy intermolt freshwater crayfish (P. leniusculus) were\n\nobtained from Lake Hja\u0308lmaren, Sweden and were maintained in\n\naerated tap water at 10uC.\n\nCloning and sequence analysis of full-length P.\nleniusculus RACK1 (PlRACK1) and PlBMAL1 cDNAs\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from crayfish brains using TRIzol LS\n\n(Invitrogen) followed by RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) treatment.\n\ncDNA synthesis was accomplished with an oligo (dT) primer and\n\nThermoScript RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufac-\n\nturer\u2019s protocol. A partial sequence of PlRACK1 was amplified\n\nusing primers that were designed based on the shrimp (P. monodon)\n\nPmRACK1 sequence (GenBank accession no. EF569136), where-\n\nas PlBMAL1 primers were based on the cDNA sequences from\n\nseveral organisms (listed in Table S2). To obtain the full-length\n\ncDNAs of the PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1 genes, 59 and 39 rapid\n\namplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technology was performed\n\nusing the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech)\n\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The complete\n\nPlRACK1 cDNA sequence was amplified using gene-specific\n\nprimers for PlRACK1 (Table S2) and the SMART Universal\n\nPrimer A. The PCR products were then cloned into the TOPO\n\nTA cloning vector and sequenced. The deduced amino acid\n\nsequence of the PlRACK1 gene was searched against the\n\nGenBank database with the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.\n\nnlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Sequence alignment of PlRACK1 was\n\ngenerated by ClustalW, and the protein domains were analyzed\n\nwith the SMART program (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/).\n\nTissue distribution analysis\nTotal RNAs were isolated from different crayfish tissues using\n\nTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by RNase-free DNase I\n\n(Ambion) treatment. For reverse transcription, 1 mg of total RNA\nwas reverse transcribed to produce cDNA using ThermoScrip RT-\n\nPCR (Invitrogen). To amplify and visualize the cDNAs of PlRACK1\n\nand PlBMAL1, two sets of primers were used: the forward and\n\nreverse primers listed in Table S2. The PCR cycles were as follows: 1\n\ncycle (95uC for 2 min); 28 cycles (95uC, 30 s; 55uC, 30 s; 72uC, 40 s)\nfollowed by an extension step (72uC for 5 min).

The separated cells were washed twice with CPBS\n\nby centrifugation at 8006g for 5 min at room temperature. The\ncell pellet was re-suspended in modified L-15 medium, and cells\n\nwere then seeded at a density of 2.56106 cells/150 ml in 96-well\nplates. The HPT cells were supplemented with partially purified\n\nplasma as a source of AST1 after 1 h of attachment at room\n\ntemperature. The culture plates were incubated at 16uC, and 1/3\nof the medium was changed at 48 h intervals.\n\nMelatonin treatment\nFor the in vivo experiments, 100 ml of a melatonin solution\n\n(Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in crayfish saline (to a\n\nfinal ethanol concentration of 1%). This solution was injected into\n\nthe base of a walking leg such that the amount of injected\n\nmelatonin was 4.3 nmol/g fresh weight. Control crayfish received\n\n100 ml of saline with 1% ethanol. The hemolymph, brain, and\nHPT of these crayfish were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h post-\n\ninjection for the extraction of total RNA, whereas samples for total\n\nprotein extraction were dissected at 3 h post-injection.

The first\n\nand second groups were injected with 300 mg of GFP control\ndsRNA and 300 mg of dsAST2, respectively, at the base of the\nfourth walking leg. Twenty-four hours after the first dsRNA\n\ninjection, four drops of crayfish hemolymph were bled for total\n\nRNA isolation to test the efficiency of the RNAi.

The beads were washed with ice-cold PBS\n\nfollowed by incubation in reducing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl and\n\n20 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temper-\n\nature. After centrifugation at 1,0006g for 5 min, the supernatant\nwas collected and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The protein\n\nconcentration was measured, and the proteins were stored at\n\n280uC. The full-length sequence of PlBMAL1 was ligated into\nEcoRI/XhoI-linearized pGEX-4T-1 and pET-32a vectors to create\n\na plasmid that expresses GST- and His-Trx fusion proteins,\n\nrespectively. The recombinant GST-PlBMAL1 protein was ex-\n\npressed and purified in a similar manner as the GST-PlRACK1\n\nprotein. The His-Trx-PlBMAL1 recombinant protein was purified\n\nusing a Ni-NTA column. His-Trx-AST2 was expressed and purified\n\nas described in earlier publications [25]. Briefly, His-Trx tagged\n\nAST2 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and induced by the\n\naddition of 0.02 mM IPTG. The cells were resuspended in lysis\n\nbuffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 2% Triton\n\nX-100) and purified using HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo Scientific).\n\nThe protein products of the His-Trx tag expression vector pET-32a\n\nand the expression vector pGEX-4T-1, which are used for the\n\nincorporation of N-terminal thioredoxin and GST tags, respective-\n\nly, were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The thioredoxin and\n\nGST proteins were purified with HisPur Cobalt or Glutathione\n\nSepharose resins, respectively, as control proteins. All samples were\n\nanalyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE.\n\nIn vitro GST pull-down assay\nTo identify putative AST2-binding proteins, total protein was\n\nextracted from crayfish brains in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-\n\nHCl (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF,\n\n10 mM MG132 and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor tablets\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche Diagnostics).\n\nCell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,0006g for\n10 min. Recombinant GST\u2013AST2 was expressed in E. coli and\n\npurified using glutathione Sepharose 4B resin according to\n\nstandard protocols. GST\u2013AST2 or GST (3\u20134 mg) was incubated\nwith 800 mg of crude brain total protein extract at 4uC for 1 h\nunless otherwise specified. Glutathione beads were recovered by\n\nbrief centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of washing\n\nbuffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol\n\nand 0.1% Tween 20). GST was used as a control protein in this\n\nexperiment. Pull-down mixtures were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE,\n\nand after excluding the background proteins found in the control,\n\nthe remaining band of about 30 kDa was sequenced by mass\n\nspectrometry after trypsin cleavage. Identification of the protein\n\nwas based on raw MS/MS data, and ions search using the Mascot\n\nprogram (http://www.matrixscience.com).\n\nThe interaction between GST-PlRACK1and HisTrx-AST2\n\nwas examined by incubating purified GST-PlRACK1or the GST\n\ncontrol with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (50 ml a 50% bed\nslurry) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed three\n\ntimes with PBS, purified HisTrx-AST2 or the His-Trx control\n\n(5 mg) was added, and incubated for another 2 h at room\ntemperature in PBS buffer. After washing with PBS, the\n\nprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer.\n\nTo determine the formation of a PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complex,\n\n5 mg purified His-Trx-PlBMAL1 protein was incubated with 5 mg\npurified GST-PlRACK1 protein bound to Glutathione Sepharose\n\n4B beads. The beads were then washed five times, and the\n\nremaining proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer.\n\nTo explore whether AST2 can bind to PlRACK1 together with\n\nPlBMAL1, purified His-Trx-PlBMAL1 (500 ng) and His-Trx-\n\nAST2 (500 ng) were incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B-\n\nbound GST-PlRACK1 (0, 5, 50, 500 ng) in PBS buffer at 25uC for\n2 h. The protein-bead complexes were washed, and the bound\n\nproteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer. All protein samples\n\nwere resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by western blot.\n\nBlot overlay assays\nIn addition to an in vitro GST pull-down assay, a far western\n\noverlay assay was used to identify any putative AST2 binding\n\nprotein. The protein was extracted from crayfish HPT and then\n\nsubjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PDVF membranes,\n\nand blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-\n\nHCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) at room\n\ntemperature. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were\n\nincubated with 25 mM GST-AST2 or GST alone in 10 ml TBST\n\nbuffer at room temperature. The blots were washed twice and\n\nincubated for 1 h with 1:2,000 dilution of anti GST antibody and\n\nthen washed twice, incubated for 1 h with 1:1,000 dilution of anti\n\nmouse antibody for 1 h, and washed three times before detection\n\nwith an ECL western blotting reagent kit. The control reaction\n\nwas incubated with GST instead of GST-AST2.\n\nPurified GST-PlRACK1 protein was cleaved by incubation with\n\nthrombin (GE Healthcare, 1 ml thrombin per 100 mg recombinant\nprotein) at 22uC overnight to remove the GST fusion tag. Free\nPlRACK1was eluted with PBS from the Glutathione Sepharose 4B\n\nbeads. PlRACK1 was run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to\n\nPDVF membranes and incubated at 4uC overnight with purified\nGST-PlBMAL1 or GST alone (7 mg) in 10 ml TBST buffer. The\nblot was washed three times (10 min each) in TBST containing\n\n0.05% Tween 20. Protein interactions were detected by western\n\nblotting using an anti-GST antibody. Blot overlay assays were also\n\nused to confirm the binding of AST2. Preparation of total crayfish\n\nbrain homogenates and gel overlays with recombinant GST-AST2\n\n(far western blots) were performed as described above.\n\nwas used as a control (white).

Cell extracts for western\n\nblotting and immunoprecipitation were prepared by suspending\n\nthe PBS-washed cells in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0),\n\n150 mM NaCl, and 1.0% NP-40) with protease inhibitor cocktail\n\ntablets (Roche). Following incubation on ice for 30 min, non-\n\nextractable material was removed by centrifugation at\n\n13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4uC. Cleared supernatants were used\nfor immunoprecipitation, whereas whole homogenized cells were\n\nmixed with 1X SDS loading buffer with and without DTT,\n\nfollowed by western analysis. Cell extracts analyzed directly by\n\nELISA were homogenized in bicarbonate/carbonate coating\n\nbuffer (pH 9.6).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and\n\ntransferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, America) in electro-\n\nblotting buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20% methanol) for\n\n120 min.

Molecular model of the circadian regulation by CLK, PlBMAL1, PlRACK1, and AST2. The protein level of CLK is enhanced during\nthe light period, and a CLK-PlBMAL1 complex is formed that acts as a transcriptional activator. During the dark period melatonin secretion causes an\nupregulation of AST2 and this high AST2 level results in the formation of a complex between PlBMAL1 and PlRACK1. Then AST2 binds to PlRACK 1 in\nthe PlBMAL-PlRACK1 complex and forms the AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complex and this interferes with the formation and activity of the CLK-PlBMAL1\nheterodimer.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003361.g009\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 16 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\ndensitometer. These quantity-one files were used for protein\n\nanalysis.

These values were used to perform\n\nstatistical analysis as described in the \u2018\u2018Statistical analysis\u2019\u2019 part\n\nbelow.\n\nImmunoprecipitation\nImmunoprecipitations were performed by first incubating cell\n\nlysates from brain or HPT with the indicated primary antibodies\n\novernight at 4uC. Immune complexes were then precipitated by\nincubating reactions for an additional 2 h at 4uC with either\nSepharose-conjugated protein A or agarose-conjugated protein G.\n\nThe immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1% Triton\n\nX-100 lysis buffer and were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample\n\nbuffer for western blotting.\n\nTranscription analysis\nThe transcript levels of AST1 and AST2 were detected by\n\nquantitative RT-PCR using QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit\n\n(QIAGEN). The relative expression was normalized to the\n\nexpression of the mRNA encoding the crayfish ribosomal protein\n\ngene (R40s) for each sample. The primers used are shown in Table\n\nS2. The qPCR reactions contained 5 ml of 1:10 diluted cDNA\ntemplate, 1xQuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix (QIA-\n\nGEN) and 5 mM forward and reverse primers in a 25 ml reaction\nvolume. The following amplification profile was used: 95uC for\n15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94uC for 15 s, 58uC for 30 s, and\n72uC for 30 s. All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicates.\nThe hemocytes, HPTs and brains from a least three crayfish were\n\nused for each time point. The statistical comparisons were\n\nperformed as shown below (Statistical analysis).\n\nELISA\nCell extracts, containing protein at 20 mg/ml were coated in\n\nwells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by\n\nincubation with blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS). Following\n\nthree careful washes with PBS, the different proteins were detected\n\nwith the corresponding primary antibody (1:1000) followed by\n\nHRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000). After the addition\n\nof 100 ml tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma) and\nincubation for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by 100 ml of\nstop solution (0.5 M sulfuric acid) and the absorbance of the\n\nresulting color was measured at 450 nm. All samples were\n\nperformed in triplicates and each experiment was repeated three\n\ntimes.\n\nAntibodies\nPolyclonal antibodies against recombinant crayfish AST1 and\n\nAST2 were raised in rabbit as have been described earlier [31]. A\n\ngoat polyclonal antibody to human BMAL1 (N-5: SC-8550) and\n\ngoat polyclonal antibody to mouse CLK (S-19: SC-6927) were\n\nobtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A goat polyclonal\n\nantibody to RACK1 (GNB2L1: Orb22484) was obtained from\n\nBiorbyt. A goat polyclonal antibody against actin (C-11: SC-1615)\n\nwas used as internal control. The specificity of each antibody was\n\ntested by western blots, and all were found to be specific for each\n\nprotein.\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)\nMobility shift assays were performed according to reference\n\n[53]. Briefly, a synthetic fluorophore labeled oligonucleotide probe\n\nincluding an E-box element (CACGTG) was used as a substrate in\n\nthis assay. To generate an E-box containing double-stranded DNA\n\nfragment, the two fluorophore labeled E-box oligonucleotides\n\ndescribed below were annealed. A 30 mL EMSA reaction mixture\ncontained ,100 mM KCl, 50 ng of crude crayfish brain lysates,\n1 mg poly (dI-dC), and 10 fmol of labeled probe. For control\n10 fmol of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or mutant E-box\n\noligonucleotide were incubated as control. After incubation for\n\n1 hour on ice, antibodies against CLK protein was added and\n\nincubated another 20 minutes on ice.

When two treatments were compared, a Student\u2019s\n\npaired t-test was used. Differences were considered statistically\n\nsignificant at P,0.05 and/or P,0.01.

Unlike IcsA however, the\nspecific localisation of IcsP on the cell surface is unknown. To determine the distribution of IcsP, a haemagglutinin (HA)\nepitope was inserted into the non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 using Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE) PCR, and IcsPHA was\ncharacterised. Quantum Dot (QD) immunofluorescence (IF) surface labelling of IcsPHA was then undertaken. Quantitative\nfluorescence analysis of S. flexneri 2a 2457T treated with and without tunicaymcin to deplete lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O\nantigen (Oag) showed that IcsPHA was asymmetrically distributed on the surface of septating and non-septating cells, and\nthat this distribution was masked by LPS Oag in untreated cells. Double QD IF labelling of IcsPHA and IcsA showed that\nIcsPHA preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells and to the septum of septating cells. The localisation of\nIcsPHA in a rough LPS S. flexneri 2457T strain (with no Oag) was also investigated and a similar distribution of IcsPHA was\nobserved. Complementation of the rough LPS strain with rmlD resulted in restored LPS Oag chain expression and loss of\nIcsPHA detection, providing further support for LPS Oag masking of surface proteins. Our data presents for the first time the\ndistribution for the Omptin OM protease IcsP, relative to IcsA, and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.\n\nCitation: Tran ENH, Doyle MT, Morona R (2013) LPS Unmasking of Shigella flexneri Reveals Preferential Localisation of Tagged Outer Membrane Protease IcsP to\nSepta and New Poles.

IcsA (VirG) is a 120 kDa outer membrane (OM) protein\n\nlocalised at the cell pole [3]. It mediates intracellular cytoplasmic\n\nmovement of S. flexneri in epithelial cells, and cell-to-cell spread, by\n\nthe assembly of an F-actin comet-tail at one pole of the bacterium\n\n[4\u20136]. This type of movement is described as actin-based motility\n\n(ABM). IcsA is secreted primarily at the \u2018old pole\u2019 of Shigellae [7]\n\nwhich is opposite the \u2018new pole\u2019 (the pole derived from the site of\n\nseptation of the parent cell [8]. The 36.9 kDa IcsP (SopA) OM\n\nprotease of S. flexneri slowly cleaves IcsA at the Arg758\u2013 Arg759\nbond position [9] resulting in the release of a 95 kDa amino-\n\nterminal IcsA fragment that can be detected in culture superna-\n\ntants [5,10]. Analysis of icsP/sopA mutants has shown that IcsA is\n\ndetected across the entire surface of these bacteria with polar\n\nreinforcement [11,12]. Over-expression of IcsP results in the\n\ncomplete removal of IcsA from the cell surface [13].\n\nIcsP belongs to the Omptin family of proteases which consists of\n\n6 members; OmpT and OmpP of Escherichia coli, Pla of Yersinia\n\npestis, PgtE of Salmonella enterica, Pla endopeptidase A of Erwinia\n\npyrifoliae, and IcsP of Shigella flexneri. Immunogold labelling of\n\noverexpressed OmpP has shown that OmpP is symmetrically\n\ndistributed over the cell surface [14]. However to date, no studies\n\nhave attempted to describe the surface localisation of Omptins\n\nexpressed at native levels. While it has been suggested that IcsP\n\nmay also be located uniformly across the cell surface [13], its\n\nspecific distribution is currently unknown. In contrast to many\n\ninner membrane proteins, such as FtsZ [15] and MreB [16]\n\ninvolved in cell division and cell shape, few OM proteins have had\n\ntheir subcellular distribution determined. An exception to this is\n\nthe E. coli OM protein LamB which has been characterised to exist\n\nas two populations: one that diffuses in a helical pattern, and one\n\nthat is relatively immobile [17,18]. The E. coli Iss and Bor proteins\n\nhave been detected on the cell surface with no distinct pattern\n\n[19]. A number of non-specific E. coli OM proteins were suggested\n\nto be organised in stable helical swaths [20], and data by Shiomi\n\net al. (2006) suggested that the general protein translocation Sec\n\nmachinery itself may also be arranged in a helical array. Whether\n\nIcsP possesses a distribution similar to these OM proteins, or has\n\nan asymmetric distribution like IcsA, is the subject of this study.\n\nIn addition to the above, mutations affecting lipopolysaccharide\n\n(LPS) have also been shown to affect the observed distribution of\n\nOM proteins [21\u201324]. LPS is composed of three distinct regions:\n\nlipid A, core sugars and O antigen (Oag) polysaccharide chains.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70508\n\n\n\nStrains with LPS containing all 3 regions intact are known as\n\nsmooth LPS strains. Shigella mutants lacking Oag are known as\n\nrough LPS strains. Such strains have been shown to have high\n\nlevels of circumferentially distributed IcsA on the cell surface (at\n\nboth cell poles and on lateral regions) [25,26], compared to the\n\npolar localisation of IcsA seen in smooth LPS strains. Treatment of\n\nY serotype derivatives of smooth LPS S. flexneri with bacteriophage\n\nSf6 tailspike protein (TSP) endorhamnosidase results in the\n\nhydrolysis of Oag chains and an increase detection of circumfer-\n\nential IcsA on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence (IF)\n\nstaining [21]. This suggests that the presence of LPS Oag masks\n\nthe observed distribution of IcsA on the cell surface and supports\n\nthe idea that LPS Oag structure may block antibody accessibility\n\nto the detection of surface proteins [22,23]. The effect of LPS Oag\n\nstructure on the detection and distribution of IcsP has not been\n\ninvestigated.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the distribution of IcsP by cell\n\nsurface quantum dot (QD) IF labelling of functional, HA-tagged\n\nIcsP (IcsPHA) in S. flexneri 2457T and establish that LPS Oag masks\n\ndetection of IcsPHA on the cell surface by using tunicamycin to\n\ninhibit Oag synthesis. Additional IF labelling with anti-IcsA\n\nantibodies to mark the location of the old pole suggested that IcsP\n\nis preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells and\n\nto the septa of septating cells. We also investigated the distribution\n\nof IcsP in a rough LPS 2457T strain to provide further support for\n\nthe LPS Oag masking hypothesis. Overall, our data presents for\n\nthe first time the cell surface distribution of the Omptin OM\n\nprotease IcsP and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.\n\nThis distribution has implications for IcsA polarity determination,\n\nand a model is described to explain IcsP\u2019s contribution to IcsA\n\npolarity in S. flexneri.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics Statement\nThe anti-IcsP and anti-IcsA antibodies were produced under\n\nthe National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)\n\nAustralian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for\n\nScientific Purposes and were approved by the University of\n\nAdelaide Animal Ethics Committee.\n\nBacterial Strains, Plasmids and Media\nBacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in\n\nTable 1. Bacteria were routinely grown at 37uC in Luria-Bertani\n(LB) broth with aeration or on Congo red agar [26]. Antibiotics\n\nused were as follows: 50 mg ampicillin (Amp) ml21; 25 mg\nchloramphenicol (Cml) ml21; 50 mg kanamycin (Kan) ml21.\n\nDNA Methods\nE. coli K-12 DH5a was used for all cloning experiments. DNA\n\nmanipulation, PCR, transformation and electroporation was\n\nperformed as previously described [27,28]. Anti-HA monoclonal\n\nantibody (#H3663) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-IcsP\nand anti-IcsA antibodies were prepared as described previously\n\n[26,29]. The antibodies were produced under the National Health\n\nand Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Australian Code of\n\nPractice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes\n\nand were approved by the University of Adelaide Animal Ethics\n\nCommittee.\n\nInsertion of HA Epitope into IcsP\nThe sequence encoding the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was\n\ninserted into the putatively non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 (based\n\non sequence alignments with E. coli OmpT) using SOE PCR\n\n[30,31]. In the first part of this two-step PCR technique, upstream\n\nand downstream amplicons were amplified from S. flexneri 2457T\n\ngenomic DNA using HA encoding primers (ET18/ET19) and icsP-\n\nspecific primers (ET3/ET10) (Table 2). The two amplicons from\n\nthis primary PCR were then mixed and used as a DNA template\n\nfor the second round of PCR with primers ET3/ET10. In this\n\nsecond reaction, the HA encoding regions of the primary PCR\n\namplicons overlap and prime one another to give the final icsP\n\nPCR product with an inserted HA epitope. The icsPHA fragment\n\nwas then cloned into pGEMT-Easy and primers ET22/ET25\n\n(Table 2) were used to amplify an icsPHA product with KpnI and\n\nHindIII restriction enzyme sites from this construct. The resultant\n\nKpnI-HindIII fragment was digested and sub-cloned into likewise\n\ndigested pBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsPHA, also referred to as\n\npIcsPHA in text (Table 1). Primers ET22/ET25 were also used to\n\namplify the icsP gene from 2457T genomic DNA, and cloned into\n\npBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsP, referred to as pIcsP in text\n\n(Table 1). DNA sequencing was used to confirm that no mutation\n\nhad been introduced by PCR into the sequence, and the presence\n\nof the in-frame HA epitope tag sequence.\n\nConstruction of S. flexneri icsP mutant\nThe S. flexneri 2457T icsP- mutant strain was constructed using\n\nallelic exchange mutagenesis [27] to inactivate the icsP gene by\n\ninsertion of a kanamycin resistance gene (kanR). Initially, the icsP\n\ngene was PCR amplified with primers ET3/ET4 containing\n\nBamHI and SacI restriction sites from 2457T genomic DNA. The\n\nresultant PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and SacI and\n\nsub-cloned into likewise digested pSL1180 (Table 1). Further\n\ndigestion with ClaI allowed insertion of the AccI-AccI digested kanR\n\ngene from pKTUWE (Table 1) to give pSL1180-icsP::kanR\n\n(Table 1). Following re-digestion with BamHI and SacI, the\n\nicsP::kanR fragment was cloned into pCACTUS (Table 1) and\n\ntransformed into S. flexneri 2457T via electroporation. Allelic\n\nexchange mutagenesis was performed as previously described [27].\n\nThe icsP::kanR mutation in the virulence plasmid was confirmed by\n\nPCR with primers ET3/ET4 (Table 2) to give the 2457T icsP-\n\nmutant ETRM22 (Table 1).\n\nConstruction of S. flexneri icsP2/rmlD- Double Mutant\nThe S. flexneri 2457T icsP2/rmlD- mutant strain was constructed\n\nusing a modification of the l Red recombinase system to initially\ndelete the rmlD gene [32]. Primers ET28/ET29 containing NheI\n\nrestriction enzyme sites (Table 2) were used to PCR amplify the\n\nkanR gene from pKD4 (Table 1). The amplified product was\n\nligated into pGEMT-Easy and pGEMT-Easy::kanR was digested\n\nwith NheI. The NheI-kanR-NheI fragment was then subcloned into\n\nlikewise digested pRMA718 [26] to give pRMA718-rmlD::kanR\n\n(Table 1).

We reasoned that IcsP levels at this time point were\n\nhigh enough for subsequent immunofluorescent detection of IcsP.\n\nNo expression of IcsP was observed for icsP- as expected (Fig. 1A,\n\nlanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 & 12). Subsequent attempts to detect IcsP on\n\nthe surface of 2457T with rabbit anti-IcsP however were\n\nunsuccessful, even in a rough LPS strain (data not shown). We\n\nspeculate that as the IcsP protein used to raise antisera was\n\npurified under denaturing conditions, this may have affected the\n\nresulting antibody\u2019s ability to detect native IcsP. However,\n\ndifficulties with IF detection of cell surface IcsP with a polyclonal\n\nantibody have also been reported by others [13].

OM loops 2 and 4 were not\n\nselected for HA tag insertion to avoid the proposed catalytic\n\nresidues present in OmpT [38] which also exist in IcsP (Fig. 2C).\n\nThe IcsPHA (as well as IcsP) coding regions were placed in front of\n\nthe pBAD promoter in pBAD30 [39] to allow expression control\n\nwith arabinose. Expression of IcsP/IcsPHA was confirmed by\n\nWestern immunoblotting with anti-IcsP or anti-HA antibodies\n\n(Fig. 3A & B, lanes WM and Fig. 1A & C).\n\nIcsPHA Activity on IcsA\nTo determine whether insertion of a HA epitope into the OM of\n\nIcsP affected IcsP\u2019s protease activity on IcsA, pellet and\n\nsupernatant protein preparations of 2457T, icsP- and arabinose-\n\ninduced icsP- strains expressing pIcsPHA, pIcsP and pBAD30 were\n\nsubjected to Western immunoblotting with an anti-IcsA antibody.\n\nThe full length 120 kDa IcsA protein was detected in cell pellet\n\nsamples of all strains as expected (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9),\n\nwhile the 95 kDa cleaved form of IcsA was only detected in the\n\nsupernatant sample of 2457T, icsP- [pIcsPHA] and icsP- [pIcsP]\n\n(Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 6 & 8). These results suggest that the insertion of\n\nthe HA tag into the OM loop 5 of IcsP does not affect its ability to\n\ncleave IcsA, and hence the IcsPHA protein is functional.\n\nLocalisation of IcsP/IcsPHA Protein to the OM\nSince IcsPHA was modified compared to IcsP and expressed\n\nfrom the pBAD promoter, the presence of IcsPHA protein\n\nexclusively in the OM was confirmed by using sucrose density\n\ngradient centrifugation. The WM of icsP- [pIcsPHA] and icsP-\n\n[pIcsP] were fractionated into CM and OM on sucrose gradients,\n\nand fractions subjected to SDS 15% polyacrylamide gel electro-\n\nphoresis, prior to visualisation by Coomassie Blue staining and\n\nWestern immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-IcsP. Analysis of\n\nthe sucrose gradient samples showed that fractions which were\n\nenriched with OM proteins (OmpF, OmpC, and OmpA) [40]\n\ncontained the majority of the 36 kDa IcsPHA and IcsP proteins\n\n(Fig. 3A & B, lanes 2 to 5). These results indicate that IcsPHA is\n\nlocalised to the OM similar to IcsP, and that the HA insertion did\n\nnot result in any dramatic disruption of IcsP protein localisation.\n\nDetection of Arabinose Induced IcsPHA Expression by\nWestern Immunoblotting\n\nWild-type S. flexneri 2457T showed optimal expression levels of\n\nnative IcsP at 3 h (Fig. 1A). To investigate the conditions required\n\nfor comparable IcsPHA expression, whole cell lysate samples were\n\nprepared from icsP- [pIcsPHA] and icsP- [pBAD30] induced with\n\n0%, 0.003%, 0.006%, 0.0125%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% or 0.2%\n\n(w/v) arabinose for 1 h. Western immunoblotting with anti-IcsP\n\nshowed that a band of ,36 kDa was detected for 2457T and icsP-\n\n[pIcsPHA] induced with 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% (w/v) (w/\n\nv) arabinose (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3\u20136), with expression levels\n\ncomparable to native IcsP for icsP- [pIcsPHA] observed between\n\n0.025%\u20130.05% (w/v) arabinose induction (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 & 6).\n\nInduction at 0.03% (w/v) arabinose was hence chosen for all\n\nsubsequent experiments.\n\nCell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in S. flexneri\n2457T and the Effect of Tunicamycin Treatment\n\nHaving established an induction protocol that closely approx-\n\nimates the level of expression of IcsPHA to native IcsP, we next\n\nattempted to detect IcsPHA at these levels on the surface of 2457T\n\nicsP- using indirect QD IF microscopy. Strains icsP- [pIcsPHA] and\n\nicsP- [pBAD30] were cultured with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, fixed,\n\nand then probed for HA using a primary anti-HA antibody and a\n\nsecondary QD 525 conjugated antibody. However, no IcsPHA was\n\ndetected on the cell surface, and intensity scans of icsP- [pIcsPHA]\n\nwere equivalent to icsP- [pBAD30] (Fig. S1).\n\nSince IcsPHA could not be detected on the cell surface of icsP-\n\n[pIcsPHA], we reasoned that the presence of LPS Oag may mask\n\nthe detection of surface IcsP as this has previously been shown for\n\nIcsA [21]. An LPS Oag depletion-regeneration assay [29] was\n\nhence carried out on icsP- [pIcsPHA] and icsP- [pBAD30] induced\n\nwith 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, followed by IF labelling. This assay\n\ninvolves the use of an inhibitor of the WecA enzyme necessary for\n\nOag subunit biosynthesis using tunicamycin, and polymyxin B\n\nnonapeptide (PMBN) was used to improve OM penetration. Upon\n\nremoval of these two chemicals from growing bacteria, LPS Oag is\n\nregenerated [29]. Analysis of the resulting LPS by SDS-PAGE and\n\nsilver staining showed that icsP- [pIcsPHA] and icsP- [pBAD30]\n\nsamples treated with tunicamycin/PMBN (TP) had depleted LPS\n\nOag (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 & 6), with Oag production restored (R) upon\n\nremoval of TP (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 & 8). Untreated (U) and PMBN\n\ntreated (P) samples showed no inhibition of Oag biosynthesis as\n\nexpected (Fig. 4A, lanes 1\u20134).\n\nFollowing successful depletion of LPS Oag, QD IF microscopy\n\nwas performed on the above mentioned samples. IcsPHA could not\n\nbe detected on untreated or PMBN treated icsP- [pIcsPHA] cells, as\n\nexpected (Fig. S2A). However, surface IcsPHA was detected on\n\nicsP- [pIcsPHA] cells treated with TP, suggesting that LPS Oag is\n\nable to mask antibody accessibility to IcsPHA (Fig. S2A).\n\nInterestingly, IcsPHA appeared to be distributed asymmetrically\n\nover the cell surface of the majority of cells examined and\n\nfluorescence intensity line-scans revealed that IcsPHA localised\n\npreferentially to one pole of non-septating cells and the septa of\n\nseptating cells (Fig. S2A). To determine if the distribution of\n\nIcsPHA on the cell surface segregated to either the new pole or the\n\nold pole, additional staining of the bacteria was conducted with\n\nanti-IcsA antibodies since IcsA is known to localise to the old cell\n\npole [5]. Again, IcsPHA could not be detected on untreated or\n\nPMBN treated icsP- [pIcsPHA] cells (Fig. 5A & B) but could be\n\ndetected after TP treatment (Fig. 5C). Peak IcsPHA detection was\n\nconsistently observed at the new pole (opposing IcsA at the old\n\npole) and at the septum of septating bacteria as shown by line-\n\nscans (Fig. 5C). As expected, no surface IcsPHA was detected for\n\nuntreated, PMBN treated, or TP treated samples of icsP-\n\n[pBAD30] when stained for IcsPHA (Fig. S2B) or double stained\n\nfor IcsPHA and IcsA (Fig. S3). Notably, IcsA on icsP- [pBAD30]\n\nwas detected at higher amounts laterally and at the septa of\n\nbacteria (Fig. S3) as previously seen for DicsP strains [13].\n\nCell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in Rough\nLPS S. flexneri 2457T\n\nTo further investigate the effect of Oag on IcsP distribution, a\n\n2457T icsP2/rmlD- double mutant was constructed to indepen-\n\nold poles of septating bacteria. Student\u2019s two-tailed t-tests (D) were also conducted on the fold differences of mean IcsPHA intensities between\ndiscrete positions (new pole, old pole, and septum) of Oag-depleted icsP- and icsP-/rmlD- bacteria.

Mutation of the rmlD gene in S. flexneri results in a\n\nstrain which is unable to synthesise the precursor deoxythymidine\n\ndiphosphate (dTDP)- rhamnose required for Oag repeat units and,\n\nhence, results in a rough LPS phenotype [29,41]. Analysis of the\n\nresulting LPS conferred by icsP2/rmlD- strains expressing pIcsPHA\n\nand pBAD30 showed that rough LPS was observed for both (Fig.\n\n4B, lanes 1 & 2), with a band consistent with the size of the IcsPHA\n\nprotein (36 kDa) detected only in the icsP2/rmlD- [pIcsPHA]\n\nsample by Western immunoblotting, as expected (Fig. 4C, lane 1).\n\nFixed samples of icsP2/rmlD- [pIcsPHA] and icsP2/rmlD-\n\n[pBAD30] cells were then probed for both IcsPHA and IcsA using\n\nthe same QD IF staining protocol as previously conducted for\n\nsmooth strains. Similarly to LPS Oag-depleted icsP- [pIcsPHA],\n\nIcsPHA was detected on the bacterial surface most predominately\n\nat the new pole (Fig. 6A) and the septum (Fig. 6B). Again, the\n\nmajority of septating cells had higher peak IcsPHA intensity at the\n\nseptum than new poles of non-septating cells (line-scans Fig. 6A &\n\nB). Single staining of these cells for IcsPHA was also conducted and\n\nyielded the same localisation results (Fig. S4). As expected, IcsPHA\n\nwas not detected on the icsP2/rmlD- [pBAD30] strain in IF\n\nmicroscopy experiments when either single (Fig. S4) or double\n\nstained (Fig. 6B). Again, IcsA on icsP2/rmlD- [pBAD30] was\n\ndetected at higher amounts laterally and at the septum (Fig. 6A &\n\nB).\n\nTo again demonstrate the effect of LPS Oag masking of IcsPHA,\n\nsmooth LPS structure was restored in the icsP2/rmlD- strain\n\nexpressing pIcsPHA by transforming pRMA727 carrying a\n\nfunctional rmlD gene. Analysis of the resulting LPS conferred by\n\nicsP2/rmlD-[pIcsPHA][pRMA727] showed restored smooth LPS\n\nphenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 3), and when probed for IcsPHA by QD\n\nIF microscopy, was barely detectable (Fig. 7A). The control icsP2/\n\nrmlD- [pIcsPHA] strain carrying pACYC184 conferred a rough\n\nLPS phenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and IcsPHA was detected by IF\n\nmicroscopy with the same distribution observed previously (Fig.\n\n7B).\n\nMulti-cell Line-scan Analysis of IcsPHA Surface\nDistribution\n\nTo determine if the observed sub-cellular preference of IcsPHA\n\nto the new poles and septa is a statistically significant phenom-\n\nenon, cumulative QD IF line-scan analyses on both IcsPHA/IcsA\n\ndouble stained LPS Oag-depleted icsP- strains and rough icsP2/\n\nrmlD- strains was conducted for a larger population of cells.\n\nScanning was initiated from the new pole to the old pole (as\n\nmarked by IcsA) for non-septating cells, and from the septum to\n\nthe old pole for septating cells (Fig 8C). From 9 independent\n\nsamples of LPS Oag-depleted icsP- [pIcsPHA] and icsP- [pBAD30],\n\na total of 450 non-septating cells each were line-scanned.\n\nAdditionally a total of 355 and 256 septating cells were scanned\n\nfor icsP- [pIcsPHA] and icsP- [pBAD30] respectively. The resultant\n\nmean fluorescence intensity profiles show that IcsPHA is preferen-\n\ntially localised at the new pole and tends to gradually decrease\n\ntowards the old pole on non-septating cells expressing pIcsPHA\n\n(Fig. 8A). For septating cells, IcsPHA mean intensity is localised\n\nhighest at the septum and declines more steeply towards the old\n\npole (Fig. 8A). As expected, the intensity profiles of icsP- [pBAD30]\n\ncells were at a negligible level (Fig. 8A). Statistical analysis of mean\n\nIcsPHA intensity at discrete bacterial positions of LPS-depleted\n\nicsP- [pIcsPHA] confirmed that the localisation of IcsPHA is: (i) 2-\n\nfold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole\n\n(P = 0.004), (ii) 2.9-fold higher at the septum of septating cells than\n\nthe old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.5-fold higher at septa of\n\nseptating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells\n\n(P = 0.038) (Fig. 8D).\n\nFor the rough LPS strains, 9 independent samples of icsP2/\n\nrmlD- [pIcsPHA] and icsP2/rmlD- [pBAD30] were investigated with\n\na total of 450 non-septating cells each line-scanned. Additionally, a\n\ntotal of 172 and 173 septating cells were scanned for icsP2/rmlD-\n\n[pIcsPHA] and icsP2/rmlD- [pBAD30] respectively. Again, the\n\nmean intensity profiles of non-septating cells expressing pIcsPHA\n\nshows IcsPHA is preferentially localised at the new pole and tends\n\nFigure 9.

Likewise,\n\nIcsPHA mean intensity of septating cells is localised highest at the\n\nseptum and declines very steeply towards the old pole (Fig. 8B). As\n\nexpected, the mean intensity profiles of icsP2/rmlD- [pBAD30]\n\nwere at a negligible level (Fig. 8B). Statistical analysis of mean\n\nIcsPHA intensity at discrete bacterial positions of icsP2/rmlD-\n\n[pIcsPHA] again confirmed that the localisation of IcsPHA is: (i) 2.2-\n\nfold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole\n\n(P,0.0001), (ii) 3.6-fold higher at the septum of septating cells than\n\nthe old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.7-fold higher at septa of\n\nseptating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells\n\n(P = 0.0002) (Fig. 8D). Although, IcsPHA fluorescence intensity was\n\nan average of 2.5 times higher on icsP2/rmlD- [pIcsPHA] cells than\n\nLPS-depleted icsP- [pIcsPHA] cells, the ratios of intensity between\n\nbacterial positions were comparable to the respective fold-changes\n\nobserved for LPS Oag-depleted icsP- [pIcsPHA], suggesting that\n\nIcsPHA is localised similarly in both types of Oag deficient cells.\n\nThe lower level of IcsPHA detection on LPS-depleted icsP-\n\n[pIcsPHA] compared to icsP2/rmlD- [pIcsPHA] indicates that TP\n\ntreatment is not 100% efficient in inhibiting Oag synthesis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe cell surface distribution of neither IcsP, or any other\n\nmember of the Omptin family, had not been previously\n\ndetermined. In this study we investigated the distribution of IcsP\n\non the cell surface of S. flexneri 2a 2457T using a HA-tagged IcsP\n\nprotein (Fig. 2) under pBAD control. Characterisation of IcsPHA\n\nshowed that it was functionally able to cleave IcsA, and was\n\nsecreted into the OM comparably to IcsP (Fig. 1B & 3). However,\n\nwhen IcsPHA was expressed at native IcsP equivalent levels (Fig.\n\n1A & C), it was undetectable in the OM via QD IF microscopy in\n\nsmooth LPS S. flexneri (Fig. S1) but detectable on both LPS Oag-\n\ndepleted and rough LPS Shigella bacteria (Fig. 4, 5 & 6).\n\nFurthermore, this masking effect was restored in rough strains\n\nupon complementation of rmlD (Fig. 4B & 7). We suggest that the\n\nlong LPS Oag chains of smooth strains sterically hinder the\n\naccessibility of antibodies to the OM surface. This type of protein\n\nmasking by LPS Oag has also been shown for IcsA in 2457T [21],\n\nand several other OM proteins [22,23]. It is interesting to note that\n\nmulti-cell line-scan analysis of IcsPHA detection on the cell surface\n\nshowed that IcsPHA fluorescence intensity was higher for rough\n\nLPS cells than for LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8). Similar to its\n\nOmptin homolog, OmpT, IcsP possesses most of the putative LPS-\n\nbinding sites found in OmpT (Fig. 2C) [38] and may also interact\n\nwith LPS. Since TP is only partly effective at blocking LPS Oag\n\nsynthesis, it is possible that the few LPS Oag molecules synthesised\n\nare still closely bound to IcsP. This may cause a small amount of\n\nmasking and may explain the lower fluorescence intensity\n\nobserved on LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8A) compared to the\n\nrough LPS cells (Fig. 8B).\n\nIcsA distributions in DicsP strains previously provided indirect\nevidence to suggest that IcsP is distributed equally over the cell\n\nsurface of S. flexneri [12,13,42]. However, once the masking effect\n\nof LPS Oag was circumvented, we were able to extensively study\n\nthe distribution profile of IcsPHA in the OM. This work has shown\n\nthat IcsPHA (and likely IcsP) has an asymmetrical distribution\n\nwhich may be cell cycle dependent. On dividing cells IcsP\n\naccumulates at high concentration at the septum and then declines\n\nsteeply towards the old pole of the emerging daughter cell.\n\nHowever, once divided, detection of IcsP at the new pole (the pole\n\nderived from the septum) of daughter cells decreased significantly\n\nand then the decline towards the old pole is more moderate. To\n\nexplain this, we propose that IcsP is directed to septa of dividing\n\ncells and that daughter cells \u2018inherit\u2019 a higher concentration of IcsP\n\nat new poles (model Fig. 9). As the daughter cell elongates, IcsP is\n\nlaterally diluted, resulting in the gentle gradient on non-septating\n\ncells. In this model, lateral dilution of IcsP may occur by\n\nmembrane insertion events during cell elongation similarly to that\n\ndescribed for E. coli LamB [43]. This model predicts increased\n\ncleavage of IcsA at the septum and lateral regions of the cell in\n\norder to help set up a relatively higher concentration of IcsA at the\n\nold pole and to maintain the old pole preference of IcsA in\n\ndaughter cells. Additionally, the model may explain, and also fits,\n\nthe common observation that IcsA distributions and intensities\n\nvary between cells in a given population of the same strain.\n\nMany proteins are known to accumulate at the inner membrane\n\nof the mid-cell in order to mediate septum formation and cell\n\ndivision \u2013 for instance, FtsZ polymerises at the cytoplasmic face to\n\nform the Z-ring and attract further divisome components [44].\n\nHowever, few OM proteins have been shown to concentrate to the\n\nseptum. A notable exception to this is the OM lipoprotein LpoB\n\nwhich localises as distinct foci at septa and complexes with\n\nperiplasmic penicillin binding protein 1B tethering it to other\n\ndivisome components [44,45]. Interestingly, septal localisation of\n\nLpoB is lost when peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited [45].\n\nWhether the localisation of integral OM protein IcsP to the septal\n\nOM requires similar interactions with divisome components, or is\n\ndependent on peptidoglycan synthesis, remains to be investigated.\n\nIn summary, this work has shown for the first time the surface\n\nlocalisation of IcsP, a member on the Omptin family of OM\n\nproteases. We have observed that: (i) the distribution of IcsP is\n\nmasked by LPS Oag in S. flexneri 2457T, and (ii) IcsP is\n\nconcentrated at new poles and at the septum of dividing cells.\n\nThis distribution of IcsP explains the observed IcsA localisation\n\ndefect in DicsP strains [11,12]. We have also proposed a model to\nexplain the inheritance of OM proteins IcsP and IcsA through\n\ngenerations of cell division. Finally, unmasking of surface antigens\n\nvia LPS Oag-depletion may be useful in the study of other\n\nminimally exposed OM proteins.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Inability to detect IcsPHA on the cell surface of\n2457T icsP-.

Zhang\n\nState Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China\n\nIntroduction\n\nVibriosis, an infection caused by Vibrio species, is a wide-\n\nspread threat to the marine culture and brings about huge\n\neconomic loss worldwide. There have been more than 10\n\nkinds of vibrios reported to be the causative agents in the\n\nuniversal marine culture at present, including Vibrio an-\n\nguillarum, V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. harveyi\n\nand V. alginolyticus (Austin 2010). The genomes of all\n\nthese species have been sequenced and the information is\n\navailable on GenBank. Yet only a small portion of these\n\ngenes has been experimentally assigned a function.\n\nGenetic tools are essential for gene function analysis\n\nincluding the ectopic expression, the site-directed in-frame\n\ndeletion, and the complementation. The discovery of\n\nrestriction enzymes in the early 1970s led to the revolu-\n\ntionary progress in the analysis of nucleic acids. However,\n\nthis traditional method takes much time for the restriction\n\nenzyme digestion and ligation, meanwhile the process may\n\nbe hampered by the limited restriction enzyme sites\n\nlocated on the plasmid and versatile sites contained in the\n\ntarget DNA sequence. Furthermore, the efficiency of\n\nobtaining positive clones is closely correlated to the effec-\n\ntiveness of the restriction enzyme digestion. It is therefore\n\na burning need to expand the tools for high-throughput\n\nscreening and gene function analysis.\n\nGateway technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) is\n\na cloning technique based on site-specific recombination\n\nKeywords\n\nAsp, biofilm, gateway, T6SS, Vibrio\n\nalginolyticus.\n\nCorrespondence\n\nQ.

The results illustrated that all\n\nthe mutant strains showed no significant effects on extracellular protease pro-\n\nduction, expression of Hcp1, and biofilm formation when compared to the\n\nwild-type strain, but in-frame deletion of VEPGS_0008 resulted in obvious bio-\n\nfilm reduction and the complemented strain restored to the level of the\n\nwild-type strain. Besides, in-frame deletion of dotU1, VEPGS_0008 and ppkA2\n\nabolished the swarming ability.\n\nConclusions: A set of Gateway-compatible vectors for internal insertion,\n\nin-frame deletion and complementation of the target genes is constructed to\n\nfacilitate the general and rapid function analysis of genes involved in T6SS in\n\nVibrio alginolyticus.\n\nSignificance and Impact of the Study: The modified Gateway-compatible plas-\n\nmids greatly facilitate the high-throughput and convenient function analysis of\n\nthe unidentified genes.\n\nLetters in Applied Microbiology ISSN 0266-8254\n\nNo claim to Chinese Government works\n\nLetters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73\u201381 \u00aa 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology 73\n\n\n\ncharacteristics of the lambda bacteriophage (Landy 1989)\n\nthat encompasses two opposite recombination reactions\n\n(BP and LR). The BP recombination reaction catalysed by\n\nBP clonase refers to the recombination reaction between\n\nattB sites in the target gene and attP sites carried on the\n\ndonor vector, resulting in the attL-containing entry plas-\n\nmid. Similarly, the attL-flanked target gene carried on\n\nentry plasmid can be transferred to various destination\n\nvectors that contain homologous attR sites by the LR\n\nreaction catalysed by the LR clonase, generating the target\n\nplasmid carrying the attB-flanked sequences. Gateway\n\ntechnology avoids the labour-intensive restriction enzyme\n\ndigestion and ligation process and enhances the efficiency\n\nof getting positive strains for the presence of the counter-\n\nselective marker, CcdB. At present, Gateway cloning sys-\n\ntem has been successfully used for high-throughput gene\n\nfunction analysis in various microorganisms (Dupuy et al.\n\n2004; Hope et al. 2004; Busso et al. 2005; Yahata et al.\n\n2005).\n\nIn this study, we have described the construction of a\n\nset of modified Gateway-compatible vectors and their\n\napplication in the rapid investigation of roles of type VI\n\nsecretion system (T6SS) genes in fish pathogen V. algino-\n\nlyticus. The Gateway-compatible vector derivatives are\n\nalso useful in gene function analysis in other vibrios and\n\nGram-negative bacteria.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nVectors, bacterial strains, and culture conditions\n\nThe vectors and strains utilized in the study are listed in\n\nTable 1.

The fragment with 210-bp in-frame deletion of\n\nthe dotU1 gene generated by overlap PCR was cloned into\n\nthe donor vector, pDONR221 with the BP reaction to get\n\nthe entry plasmid. Besides, for the construction of corre-\n\nsponding complemented strains, the sequences containing\n\nthe intact promoter regions and ORFs of the indicated\n\ngenes were obtained by PCR with the designed primers\n\nharbouring attB sites and then transferred to the\n\npDONR221 with BP reaction. The primers used for gene\n\ncloning and plasmid construction are listed in Table 2.\n\nConstruction of the destination vectors\n\nTo create the Gateway-compatible plasmids, first, the\n\nattR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette was amplified from\npDEST17 (Invitrogen) with primers pDDF and pDDR,\n\nwhich covered 15-bp sequence homologous to either side\n\nof the SalI site located on pNQ705-1 (Wang et al. 2002)\n\nand pDM4 (Milton et al. 1996) at the 5\u00a2 end, SalI site in\nthe middle, and the specific sequence of the attR1-\n\nccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette at the 3\u00a2 end. Then the fragment\nwas cloned into SalI digested linearized pNQ705-1 and\n\npDM4 respectively, to generate the destination plasmids\n\npNQ705-1.DEST and pDM4.DEST for the mutant con-\n\nstruction using the seamless cloning kit according to the\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instruction (Genescript, Shanghai, China).\n\nLikewise, the pMMB206.DEST was produced by inserting\n\nattR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette amplified from pDEST17\nusing primers pMDF and pMDR into the EcoRI digested\n\npMMB206 (Morales et al. 1991). All destination plasmids\n\nwere transformed into SM10 kpir strain that was resistant\nto the CcdB toxicity and also supported replication of the\n\np protein required R6K plasmids such as pNQ705-1 and\npDM4 for positive screening.\n\nTransfer of target genes into the destination vectors\n\nAll the entry vectors and corresponding destination plas-\n\nmids were harvested from various hosts (Table 1). LR\n\nrecombination reaction was carried out according to the\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instruction (Invitrogen) and the reaction\n\nmixture was then transformed into E. coli CC118 kpir (Den-\nnis and Zylstra 1998). The destination vectors carrying the\n\ntarget sequences were confirmed by PCR and sequencing.\n\nScreening of target gene deletion mutants\n\nIn-frame deletion mutants were constructed in the\n\nselected genes by double-crossover allelic exchanges\n\naccording to previous protocols (Liu et al. 2011).\n\nWestern-blot analysis of Hcp1 and Asp\n\nTo detect the production of Hcp1 and Asp, Western-blot\n\nwas carried according to the previous work (Sheng et al.\n\n2012).\n\nExtracellular protease activity, biofilm formation, motil-\n\nity assay, and LD50 determination\n\nThe extracellular product (ECP) production assays deter-\n\nmined with hide powder azure (HPA) digestion assay and\n\nmilk plate assay, biofilm formation, motility assay, and\n\nLD50 determination with healthy zebrafish were carried\n\nout according to the previously described methods (Liu\n\net al. 2011).\n\nAggregation assay\n\nOvernight cultures of all the tested strains were harvested\n\nand normalized to the same OD600 values in 5 ml LBS\n\nbroth in glass test tubes. All the tubes were shaken vigor-\n\nously first and then cultured statically at room tempera-\n\nture for 10 min. Afterwards, OD600 of each strain was\n\nassayed to determine the aggregation.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical significance was determined using Student\u2019s\n\nt-test (spss 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nResults\n\nConstruction of the Gateway-compatible destination\n\nvectors\n\nThe plasmid pNQ705-1 (Wang et al. 2002) used for inser-\n\ntion mutation construction, pDM4 (Milton et al. 1996)\n\nfor in-frame deletion mutant construction, and pMMB206\n\n(Morales et al. 1991) for complementation construction\n\nare widely used for the construction of mutant and com-\n\nplemented strains. They carried defined restriction enzyme\n\nsites, and thus the flexibility was limited. Besides, all the\n\nabove plasmids are recalcitrant to be definitely digested or\n\nobserved to show smearing on agarose gel (H. Liu, D. Gu\n\nand Q.Y. Wang, unpublished data). Thus, it is difficult\n\nand time-consuming for gene cloning using these plas-\n\nmids with the conventional method of restriction enzyme\n\ndigestion and ligation. To circumvent these limitations,\n\nwe set to modify the plasmids to make them compatible\n\nfor using with the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The\n\nattR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette was amplified from\npDEST17 (Invitrogen) using the primers with the addition\n\nof the 21-bp consensus sequence to the defined sequences\n\nGateway plasmids for genetic analysis H. Liu et al.\n\n76 Letters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73\u201381 \u00aa 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology\nNo claim to Chinese Government works\n\n\n\nof pDM4, pNQ705-1, and pMMB206 plasmids respec-\n\ntively (Fig. 1) and then moved onto these plasmids by\n\nseamless cloning method (Genescript). The desired desti-\n\nnation plasmids maintained in E. coli SM10 kpir strain\nthat was resistant to the toxic effect of CcdB and mean-\n\nwhile supplied the pir-encoded p protein for replication of\nR6K plasmids (e.g. pNQ705-1 and pDM4) (Table 1) were\n\nselected on the plates containing the indicated antibiotics.\n\nThe sequencing results confirmed the presence and the\n\nvalidity of the attR1-ccdB \u2044 Cmr-attR2 cassette in all\ntested strains. Therefore a set of Gateway-compatible plas-\n\nmids for convenient and systemic gene function analy-\n\nsis, including pNQ705-1.DEST, pDM4.DEST, and\n\npMMB206.DEST, was successfully constructed.\n\nExpression of Hcp1 based on Gateway destination plas-\n\nmid pDEST17\n\nTo evaluate the Gateway-based cloning technology, we\n\ncloned the ORF sequences of hcp1 (the hallmark of the\n\nT6SS in V. alginolyticus) into the donor vector\n\npDONR221 (Invitrogen) to generate the entry plasmid.\n\nThen the ORF of hcp1 was transferred from the entry vec-\n\ntor into the destination vector, pDEST17 (Invitrogen),\n\nwhich contains the strong bacteriophage T7 promoter for\n\nthe controlled and inducible expression of the proteins of\n\ninterest and 6 \u00b7 His at the N-terminal of the specific\nsequence for the convenient purification, by LR reaction\n\nto obtain the expression plasmid. The efficiency of recov-\n\nering desired clones was high (49 \u2044 50 positive, data not\nshown). However, 25-bp attB sites remained flanking the\n\nORF of hcp1 (Fig. 2a). To verify the expression of Hcp1\n\nbased on Gateway system, the Hcp1 expression was\n\ninduced by adding isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside\n(IPTG) when the OD600 reached 0\u00c64. Then the total pro-\nteins were harvested and loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe result demonstrated that Hcp1 was expressed success-\n\nfully by using the Gateway-based plasmids and the pres-\n\nence of the attB sites seems to exert no effect on the\n\nnormal expression of Hcp1 (Fig. 2b). The expression of\n\nHcp1 utilizing pDEST17 was also verified by Western-blot\n\nusing Hcp1-specific antibody (Sheng et al. 2012)\n\n(Fig. 2b). Taken together, the protein expression can be\n\nachieved rapidly and efficiently with Gateway technology.\n\nFunctional analysis of T6SS genes using Gateway-com-\n\npatible plasmids\n\nTo validate and evaluate the Gateway-compatible plas-\n\nmids for mutant construction, five genes involved in\n\nT6SS in V. alginolyticus were selected to generate the in-\n\nframe deletion mutants. The process avoided the restric-\n\ntion enzyme selection, and the transfer efficiency of the\n\ntarget genes into the destination plasmids reached 90\u2013\n\n100%. All the five in-frame deletion mutant strains were\n\nobtained successfully following the double-crossover alle-\n\nlic exchanges according to previous protocols (Liu et al.\n\n2011). Meanwhile, all the complemented strains were also\n\ngenerated successfully using Gateway-compatible plasmid\n\npMMB206.DEST.

Liu et al. Gateway plasmids for genetic analysis\n\nNo claim to Chinese Government works\n\nLetters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73\u201381 \u00aa 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology 77\n\n\n\nmutation of the target genes was also achieved in V. algi-\n\nnolyticus (data not shown).\n\nThe T6SS has been linked to a myriad of processes,\n\nincluding biofilm formation (Aschtgen et al. 2008), motil-\n\nity (Jana et al. 2011), extracellular protease production\n\n(Weber et al. 2009), and promoting or limiting virulence\n\n(Filloux 2009). Here in, all the five obtained mutant strains\n\nbased on Gateway-compatible plasmids were analysed for\n\ntheir roles in regulating the virulence-related elements,\n\nincluding motility, extracellular protease production,\n\nbiofilm formation, and T6SS hallmark Hcp1 secretion in\n\nV. alginolyticus. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3, there were\n\nno significant differences in swimming and aggregation in\n\nall tested strains, but DdotU1, DN08 harbouring in-frame\ndeletion of VEPGS_0008 gene, and DppkA2 lost the\nswarming ability. The extracellular protease production in\n\nthe mutant strains displayed no significant difference in\n\ncomparison with the wild-type strain. However, DN11\n\nstrain, which carried in-frame deletion of VEPGS_0011\n\ngene, exhibited almost 50% reduction in extracellular pro-\n\ntease production. Unfortunately, the complemented strain\n\ndid not fully restore to the level of the wild-type strain\n\n(Fig. 3b).\n\nBesides, the biofilm assay results revealed that all the\n\nfive mutant strains, except DN08, showed comparable\n\nlevel of biofilm production to that of the wild-type strain.\n\nThe biofilm was almost invisible in DN08 strain and\n\nrestored to the level observed in the wild-type when the\n\nintact gene was introduced into DN08, confirming the\n\ncrucial roles of VEPGS_0008 gene in biofilm formation in\n\nV. alginolyticus. For Hcp1 production assay, there are no\n\ndissimilarities in all these five mutant strains compared\n\nwith the wild-type strain when the whole cell lysates were\n\nprobed with Hcp1-specific antibody. However, no visible\n\nband against Hcp1 was present in any of the five mutant\n\nstrains when the concentrated supernatants were con-\n\nducted. In contrast, very weak and apparent Hcp1 secre-\n\ntion could be respectively detected in the wild-type strain\n\nand the DpppA mutant strain as previously described\n(Sheng et al. 2012) (Fig. 3d).\n\nThe zebrafish infection experiment was further per-\n\nformed to evaluate the impact of the five genes on the\n\nvirulence of V. alginolyticus. The fish infected with a high\n\ndose (3\u00c65 \u00b7 107 CFU per fish) of the wild-type and the\nfive mutant strains died within 24 h. At the dose of\n\n3\u00c65 \u00b7 106 CFU per fish and 3\u00c65 \u00b7 105 CFU per fish, the\nmortality of the zebrafish reached 90% in 48 h and 60\u2013\n\n70% in 96 h respectively. All the dead fish exhibited typi-\n\ncal haemorrhagic septicaemia. The LD50 values of the\n\nmutant strains and the wild-type were calculated and\n\nthere were no significant attenuation in the five mutant\n\nstrains compared to the wild-type strain (Table 3).\n\nDiscussion\n\nGateway cloning system has been commonly utilized for\n\nhigh-throughput characterization of ORFs in single stan-\n\ndard frame in organisms, including E. coli, Saccharomyces\n\ncerevisiae, plants, and Caenorhabditis elegans (Dupuy et al.\n\n2004; Hope et al. 2004; Busso et al. 2005; Earley et al.\n\n2006; Alberti et al. 2007).

VEPGS_0011 encodes a putative T6SS\n\nlysozyme-related protein and belongs to gp25 family. The\n\nDN08 strain was unexpectedly inefficient in the biofilm\n\nformation and swarming ability. VEPGS_0008 encodes a\n\nputative transcriptional regulator belonging to AsnC fam-\n\nily, which regulates the cell metabolism in response to the\n\nexogenous amino acid and has not been well characterized\n\nso far. Its roles in T6SS and virulence regulation are not\n\nclear. Besides, DdotU1 and DppkA2 displayed no swarm-\ning ability. The dotU1 gene encodes a transmembrane\n\nprotein while PpkA2 is annotated as a serine \u2044 threonine\nprotein kinase. At present, the detailed investigation of\n\nthe functions of these five genes is underway in our labo-\n\nratory. The secretion of Hcp1 was absent in all five\n\nmutant strains and their complemented strains. This may\n\nbe caused by the tight post-translational regulation of\n\nPpkA \u2044 PppA system in which PpkA is established to be\nrequired for assembly of the T6SS and secretion of Hcp\n\nand its activity is antagonized by PppA (Mougous et al.\n\n2007), for the secretion of Hcp1 was enhanced remarkably\n\nin DpppA strain (Fig. 3d). The influence of the T6SS com-\nponents on Hcp1 secretion should be further assayed in\n\nthe strain with DpppA genetic background.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study was supported by National Natural Science\n\nFoundation of China (no. 30901113) and Shanghai Lead-\n\ning Academic Discipline Project (no.

Moreover, SBT3.3 expression-sensitized plants for enhanced expression of the OXI1\nkinase gene and activation of MAP kinases following pathogen attack, providing additional clues for the regulation of\nimmune priming by SBT3.3. Conversely, in sbt3.3 mutant plants pathogen-mediated induction of SA-related defense gene\nexpression is drastically reduced and activation of MAP kinases inhibited. Moreover, chromatin remodeling of defense-\nrelated genes normally associated with activation of an immune priming response appear inhibited in sbt3.3 plants, further\nindicating the importance of the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase in the establishment of immune priming. Our results also\npoint to an epigenetic control in the regulation of plant immunity, since SBT3.3 is up-regulated and priming activated when\nepigenetic control is impeded. SBT3.3 represents a new regulator of primed immunity.\n\nCitation: Ram\u0131\u0301rez V, Lo\u0301pez A, Mauch-Mani B, Gil MJ, Vera P (2013) An Extracellular Subtilase Switch for Immune Priming in Arabidopsis.

They counteract microbial infections via activa-\n\ntion of an innate immune system in a timely, accurate, and\n\neffective manner following pathogen recognition. The innate\n\nimmune response is thought to act na\u0131\u0308vely to individual pathogen\n\nencounters and is dependent on the recognition of broadly\n\nconserved molecular features, known as microbe-associated\n\nmolecular patterns (MAMPs), by plasma membrane proteins\n\nknown as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR perception of\n\nMAMPs at the cell surface leads to a pattern-triggered immune\n\nresponse called PTI [1]. PTI is characterized by the rapid\n\ngeneration of ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species\n\n(ROS), phosphorylation cascades, and a transcriptional repro-\n\ngraming that favors defense responses over routine cellular\n\nrequirements [2]. The defense programme is ultimately controlled\n\nthrough the build-up of specific signalling hormone blends, of\n\nwhich salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are particularly\n\nimportant, and eventually establish a broad systemic alert state\n\nthroughout the plant.\n\nPlants develop heightened activation of the innate immune\n\nresponse state resulting from the initial infection manifested in the\n\nform of enhanced resistance to subsequent infections by a broad\n\nspectrum of pathogens. This type of induced resistance (IR) or\n\ncross-protection exhibits memory characteristics after the first\n\nencounter with a pathogen - training effect - and appears\n\nevolutionarily conserved, even outside the plant kingdom. Netea\n\net al. [3] coined the term \u2018\u2018trained immunity\u2019\u2019 to differentiate it\n\nfrom \u2018\u2018innate immunity\u2019\u2019 (as it is induced only secondarily in hosts\n\nthat have previously encountered a primary infection), or from\n\n\u2018\u2018adaptive immunity\u2019\u2019 (as this implies specificity through T and B\n\ncells). In plants, two distinct types of this resistance form have been\n\ndescribed: systemic acquired resistance (SAR), and induced\n\nsystemic resistance (ISR) [4,5]; both represent a functional\n\nimmune acclimation requiring the defense response regulator\n\nNPR1.\n\nParticularly relevant in IR responses is the observation that\n\ndefence genes, in both the local (infected) and distal tissue, respond\n\nto much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more rapid and\n\nrobust manner than controls, thus revealing a \u2018\u2018priming\u2019\u2019\n\nphenomenon. In fact, priming has long been known as a\n\ncomponent of IR responses in plants [6,7] and mammals [8\u201310],\n\nand more recently in invertebrates, which like plants lack adaptive\n\nimmunity [11]. Similarly, Arabidopsis mutants attenuated in\n\npathogen defense (i.e. npr1) are also compromised in priming\n\n[12,13]. Organic and inorganic compounds can also induce this\n\nform of resistance in plants [14]. Among these, azelaic acid [15],\n\nSA, and its functional analogue benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-car-\n\nbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) [16], or the non-protein amino\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\nacid b-aminobutyric acid (BABA) [17] have attracted marked\ninterest as they potentiate pathogen-specific defense mechanisms,\n\nand induction of a primed state. However, very little is known\n\nabout the molecular mechanism(s) and signals that set a priming\n\nstate in motion, or the identity of molecular components that\n\npertain to the maintenance of a long lasting immune primed state,\n\nsuch as SAR.\n\nConrath et al. [18] hypothesized that IR or cell priming could be\n\nbuilt on the accumulation of dormant or inactive signalling\n\nproteins, integral in signal amplification that becomes operative\n\nfollowing a challenge with another pathogen, thereby initiating\n\nsignal amplification leading to a faster and stronger activation of\n\ndefense responses. However, the identity of such signalling\n\ncomponents remains elusive. Interestingly, Beckers et al. [12] have\n\nshown that during development of BTH induced resistance in\n\nArabidopsis, priming is associated with accumulation of inactive\n\nproteins of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK3 and\n\nMPK6. Exposure to the challenges of biotic and abiotic stressors\n\nresults in stronger activation of the two kinases in primed plants\n\nrelative to non-primed plants, which is linked to enhanced defense\n\ngene expression. Priming of defense gene expression was reduced\n\nin mpk3 or mpk6 mutants, showing that pre-stress deposition of a\n\nMPK cascade is a critical step in priming plants for a full defense\n\nresponse induction during IR [12].\n\nEssential IR response components must rely in a plant\u2019s\n\ncapacity to reprogram gene expression. Among the mechanisms\n\ninvolved in immune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the\n\nimportance of chromatin remodeling and covalent histone\n\nmodifications is emerging [19]. Jaskiewicz et al. [20], reported\n\nthat during primed BTH immunity, increased acetylation of\n\nhistone H3 at Lys-9 (H3K9ac) and trimethylation of histone H3 at\n\nLys-4 (H3K4me3) was detected at promoter regions of several SA-\n\nresponsive genes encoding transcription factors (i.e. WRKY6,\n\nWRKY29, and WRKY52). Similarly, constitutively increased\n\nH3K4me3 and H3K9ac mark setting in chromatin of the SA-\n\ndependent PR1 gene was initially reported in sni1 (suppressor of nrp1-\n\n1, inducible 1) mutant [21]. The settling of these histone\n\nmodifications lead chromatin into a suitable state for efficient\n\nSA-responsive gene induction when needed. The results also\n\nindicated a causal link between priming and chromatin remod-\n\neling, pointing to a histone memory for information storage in the\n\nplant stress responses [19]. On the other hand RNA Polymerase V\n\nis an enzyme critical in the epigenetic RNA-directed DNA\n\nmethylation (RdDM) pathway and is involved in regulating both\n\nDNA methylation and histone modifications [22]. In this context,\n\nLo\u0301pez et al. [23] reported that RNA Polymerase V defective\n\nmutants carry a constitutive priming phenotype where SA-related\n\ndefense genes are poised for enhanced activation via similar\n\nH3K4me3 and H3K9ac histone modifications in their promoters.\n\nThese results emphasized the importance of epigenetic control as\n\nan additional layer of complexity in plant immunity and IR\n\nregulation [23]. Furthermore, DNA methylation has been\n\nimplicated in the transmission of a priming state or stress memory,\n\nendowing progeny of pathogen-inoculated plants with heightened\n\nresistance (transgenerational IR), suggesting plants can inherit\n\npriming sensitization [24,25].\n\nIn the present study, we report on identification and charac-\n\nterization of the inducible Arabidopsis subtilase SBT3.3 to\n\ncharacterize additional cellular components mediating initiation\n\nand or/maintenance of primed immunity. This extracellular\n\nproteolytic enzyme serves a signaling role in establishing immune\n\npriming. The mechanism subsequently activates chromatin\n\nremodeling and defense genes become poised for enhanced\n\nactivation following pathogen attack. Our study provides strong\n\nevidence that SBT3.3 is a primary switch in immune priming, and\n\nit may represent one of the missing components in systemic IR\n\nestablishment.\n\nResults\n\nThe Arabidopsis subtilase gene SBT3.3 is up-regulated in\nthe csb3 mutant\n\nThe Arabidopsis enhanced disease resistance csb3 (constitutive\n\nsubtilisin3) mutant [26] was isolated during a search for negative\n\ndisease resistance regulators in a mutant screening that evaluated\n\nconstitutive expression of GUS activity driven by the 59 promoter\n\nregion of a pathogen-induced subtilase gene (P69C) from tomato\n\nplants [27]. Arabidopsis possess fifty-six highly similar genes\n\nencoding subtilases [28], therefore constitutive expression of the\n\nArabidopsis gene homologous to P69C would be similarly up-\n\nregulated in the csb3 mutant. Constitutively expressed genes\n\ndifferentially expressed in the csb3 mutant with respect to wild-type\n\nplants were identified by microarray analysis of RNA transcripts\n\nusing ATH1 Affymetrix chips. The microarray analysis (NCBI\n\nGEO Series number GSE35507) identified one hundred down-\n\nregulated genes and 367 up-regulated genes in the csb3 mutant\n\n(Supplemental Table S1 and Figure S1). Among the genes up-\n\nregulated $2-fold (p values,0.05) in the csb3 mutant, we\n\nidentified 23 genes that could be linked to disease resistance and\n\nSA-mediated responses based on published results (Supplemental\n\nTable S2). It was notable that among them one encoded a\n\nsubtilase: SBT3.3 (At1g32960). Moreover, public microarray data\n\nmining showed that SBT3.3, out of the 56 paralogous subtilases\n\nfrom Arabidopsis, with the exception of At1g32940, is the one\n\nshowing strongest response to pathogen attack and to pathogen-\n\nrelated stress signals (Supplementary Figure S2).\n\nCoincident with what has been described in the tomato\n\ngenome, where the P69C subtilase clusters with three additional\n\nP69C-like ORFs (i.e. P69A, P69D, P69C, and P69B) [29], the\n\nSBT3.3 subtilase gene was similarly embedded in a genomic\n\ncluster encompassing three additional subtilases (i.e. SBT3.5,\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nFollowing a first encounter with a pathogen, higher\neukaryotes develop enhanced resistance to subsequent\ninfections by a broad spectrum of pathogens. This type of\ninduced resistance (IR) exhibits memory characteristics\nafter the first encounter with a pathogen \u2014training\neffect\u2014 and appears evolutionarily conserved. IR response\ncomponents must reside in a plant\u2019s capacity to reprogram\ngene expression. Among the mechanisms involved in\nimmune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the im-\nportance of chromatin remodelling is emerging. Recent\nstudies indicated a causal link between priming and\nchromatin remodelling, pointing to a histone memory for\ninformation storage in the plant immune response. These\nresults emphasized the importance of epigenetic control\nas an additional layer of complexity in plant immunity.\nHowever, the nature of the components for activating this\ntype of immunological memory remains elusive. Here, in a\nsearch aiming to identify cellular factors integral in\nregulating immunity in Arabidopsis, we found that the\nSBT3.3 gene, encoding an extracellular subtilase enzyme, is\npivotal for establishing plant immune priming. Moreover,\nbased on molecular and genetic evidences, our results\nindicate that SBT3.3 expression is under epigenetic control\nthus highlighting the importance of this mechanism of\ngene regulation in the control of plant immunity and IR.\n\nSBT3.3 and Immune Priming\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\nSBT3.4, SBT3.3 and SBT3.2) in Chromosome 1 (Fig. 1A). Thus, it\n\nseems very likely that the Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase, could\n\nrepresent the evolutionarily conserved ortholog of the P69C\n\nsubtilase from tomato, and the promoter activation was the clue\n\nfor identifying the csb3 mutant.\n\nThe SBT3.3 gene encodes a 777 amino acid preproenzyme\n\n(Fig. 1B and Supplemental Figure S3) containing a N-terminal 25\n\namino acid signal peptide followed by an 86-amino acid\n\npropolypeptide (aa 26 to 111), and a 666-amino acid mature\n\npolypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 71237 Da. The\n\nmature polypeptide comprises eight potential asparagine-linked\n\nglycosylation sites (NXS/T). On the basis of sequence similarities\n\nwith other subtilases, including P69C [30], the amino acid residues\n\nSer-555, Asp-145, and His-223 were identified as residues of the\n\ncatalytic triad (Fig. 1B).\n\nExpression pattern of SBT3.3 following pathogen\ninoculation\n\nTo mode of SBT3.3 gene regulation in plant immunity was\n\nassessed by inoculating Col-0 leaves with the bacterial pathogen\n\nPseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PsDC3000), carrying or not the\n\navirulence gene AvrRpm1, and temporal gene expression patterns\n\nwere determined by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). SBT3.3\n\nwas barely detectable in mock-inoculated plants, but strongly\n\ninduced during the PsDC3000 immune response (Fig. 1C).\n\nHowever, inconsistent with observations for SA-regulated\n\nmarker genes (i.e. PR-1 and PR-2), SBT3.3 induction was\n\ntransient, peaking at 48 hpi (hours post inoculation) and\n\nabruptly decaying thereafter. The strongest induction was\n\nobserved following inoculation with the avirulent strain\n\nPsDC3000 (AvrRpm1) (Figure 1C); induction was again transient,\n\npeaking at 12 h.p.i, and decayed thereafter. SBT3.3 expression\n\npreceded PR-1 and PR-2 gene induction, suggesting that the\n\nsignals that set in motion transcriptional reprogramming of\n\nthese two types of gene responses might differ. Expression of PR-\n\n1 and PR-2 genes in the distal non-inoculated leaves was also\n\nobserved for SBT3.3, although distal expression was not as high\n\nas that attained in local leaves (Fig. 1C). High and rapid (within\n\nan hour) induced SBT3.3 expression was also promoted by\n\nbacterial PAMP flg22 application to Col-0 plants (Supplemental\n\nFig. S4), providing additional support for the association\n\nof SBT3.3 expression with early innate immune response\n\nactivation.\n\nSBT3.3 functions in disease resistance\nThe importance of SBT3.3 in plant immunity was investi-\n\ngated by characterizing the response of two independent T-\n\nDNA insertion lines for SBT3.3 (sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2; Fig. 1A)\n\nto PsDC3000 infection (Fig. 2A). We also characterized the\n\nresponse of two independent T-DNA lines available for one of\n\nthe linked subtilase genes (i.e. SBT3.4) within the same genomic\n\ncluster (sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2; Fig. 1A). The enhanced disease\n\nsusceptibility mutant npr1-1 was incorporated into the experi-\n\nments as a control. Disease performance was assayed by\n\nmeasuring bacterial growth in the inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A).\n\nThe two control mutant lines, sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2 behaved as\n\ninoculated Col-0 plants, indicating that SBT3.4 is not essential\n\nto activate immune responses. However, npr1 plants, and either\n\none of the two sbt3.3 mutants, supported significant increases in\n\nbacterial growth. The enhanced disease susceptibility was\n\naccompanied by development of disease symptoms in the form\n\nof visible chlorotic lesions on inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A). The\n\nresults suggest that SBT3.3 positively regulates disease resistance\n\nto PsDC3000.\n\nChanges in the susceptibility of sbt3.3 plants to biotrophic\n\npathogens were further investigated by inoculating plants with a\n\nvirulent strain of the obligate oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidop-\n\nsidis (isolate Noco) (Fig. 2B). Disease severity was assessed at\n\n7 d.p.i in lactophenol trypan-blue-stained leaves. The leaves were\n\nFigure 1.

Both, sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-\n\n2 mutant plants exhibited a significantly higher degree of\n\ncolonization by the oomycete than the control Col-0 plants\n\n(Fig. 2B), becoming heavily covered with sporangiophores, which\n\nelicited appearance of chlorosis and eventual leaf collapse\n\n(namely Class V). The observed enhanced disease susceptibility\n\nof sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2 plants to H. arabidopsidis was corroborated\n\nby directly counting of spore production in inoculated plants\n\n(Supplemental Fig. S5). These results confirmed that loss of\n\nSBT3.3 function also enhanced plant susceptibility to H.\n\narabidopsisdis, further substantiating its value in establishing an\n\neffective plant immune response.\n\nSBT3.3 is required for expression of SA-responsive genes\nCompromised expression of SA-responsive genes is observed in\n\nmutants defective in resistance to biotrophic pathogens (i.e. npr1;\n\n[31]). Consequently, we considered the possibility that the\n\nincreased susceptibility towards pathogens observed in SBT3.3\n\ndefective mutants might be similarly accompanied by a compro-\n\nmised expression of SA-responsive genes. Therefore, induction of\n\nPR-1 accumulation was examined by Western blot in sbt3.3, npr1,\n\nand Col-0 plants following inoculation with PsDC3000. The PR-1\n\nprotein, as expected, was nearly absent in npr1 plants, even at\n\n48 hpi with PsDC3000 (Fig. 2C), while PR-1 accumulation was\n\nnotable in Col-0 following inoculation. Interestingly, sbt3.3-1 and\n\nsbt3.3-2 plants exhibited results similar to the npr1 mutant, showing\n\nFigure 2.

These results were confirmed at\n\nthe transcriptional level by measuring PR-1 transcript level by RT-\n\nqPCR (Fig. 2D). As for NPR1 being required for full immunity,\n\nour results suggest that SBT3.3 is required for full expression of\n\ndownstream SA-responsive genes. This helps explaining why\n\nmutants defective in SBT3.3 are compromised in disease\n\nresistance (Figure 2A and B).\n\nSBT3.3 expression is SA-independent and responds to\nH2O2\n\nThe same mRNA preparations shown in Figure 2D were used\n\nto quantify SBT3.3 transcript accumulation following inoculation\n\nwith PsDC3000 in Col-0 and npr1 plants (Fig. 2E). RNA\n\npreparations from sbt3.3 plants (here used as a control) served to\n\ndemonstrate that in the mutant induced SBT3.3 expression was\n\ndrastically down-regulated due to the T-DNA insertion. In marked\n\ncontrast with the substantial reduction observed for PR-1\n\nactivation (Figure 2D), SBT3.3 expression in npr1 plants was\n\nidentical to that attained in Col-0 plants. Furthermore, in sid2-1\n\nmutant plants (defective in SA synthesis) induction of SBT3.3\n\nexpression upon inoculation with PsDC3000(AvrRpm1), remained\n\nunchanged with respect to Col-0 plants (Fig. 3A). This differs with\n\nthe compromised expression of PR-1 occurring in sid2 plants\n\n(Fig. 3A). These contrasting differences indicated that for\n\npathogen-induced SBT3.3 expression, SA synthesis and its\n\nperception through NPR1 are dispensable.\n\nSince oxidative burst and concurrent H2O2 accumulation\n\npreceded SA build-up during basal immunity activation [32]\n\nand SBT3.3 induction appeared as an early event preceding PR\n\ngene induction by SA (Fig. 1C\u2013D), we hypothesized that H2O2\ncould mediate SBT3.3 induction. In fact, spraying Arabidopsis\n\nleaves with a 1 mM solution of H2O2 elicited a rapid SBT3.3\n\ninduction which was notable at 1 to 3 hours after treatment\n\n(Fig. 3B). Similarly, expression of the OXI1 gene, which encodes a\n\nkinase highly induced under oxidative stress conditions [33] was\n\ntriggered by H2O2 (Fig. 3B). However, under similar inductive\n\nconditions expression of the SA-regulated gene PR-1 remained\n\nunchanged (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the cat2 mutant defective in the\n\ndismutation of H2O2 and exhibiting enhanced H2O2 accumula-\n\ntion, revealed increased SBT3.3 expression compared to Col-0\n\n(Fig. 3C). These observations indicated that SBT3.3 activation\n\nmight result from early H2O2 production during the immune\n\nresponse.\n\nSBT3.3 is secreted and accumulates extracellularly\nPlant subtilases are synthesized in the form of preproprotein\n\nprecursors, translocated via a signal peptide into the endomem-\n\nbrane system, and activated through further cleavage of the\n\npropeptide [34]. Most plant subtilases are considered glycopro-\n\nteins that predominantly accumulate extracellularly [30,34,35].\n\nSBT3.3 subcellular localization was determined by fusing mono-\n\nmeric cherry fluorescent protein (mCherry) to the C-terminus of\n\nthe full length SBT3.3, and the construct, driven by 35S promoter,\n\nexpressed in Nicotiana benthaminana leaves using agro-infiltration.\n\nLocalization of the fusion protein was confirmed by confocal\n\nmicroscopy. Results showed that SBT3.3-mCherry fluorescence\n\nwas uniformly distributed in the pericellular apoplastic space\n\n(Fig. 4A). Similar pericellular localization was observed in\n\ntransgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a 35S::SBT3.3-GFP gene\n\nconstruct (Supplemental Fig. S6). The mCherry-tagged subtilase\n\nwas co-expressed with either a construct bearing the plasma\n\nmembrane integral protein PIP1 fused to YFP, or alternatively\n\nwith a free cytosolic YFP protein to more precisely define its\n\nlocalization. SBT3.3-mCherry was localized externally to the\n\ncytoplasm, as revealed when co-expressed with a free cytosolic\n\nYFP (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, SBT3.3-mCherry was found to be\n\nsandwiched between the PIP1-YFP-tagged plasma membrane\n\nmarker of adjacent cells (Fig. 4B) and thus unambiguously\n\nlocalized to the extracellular matrix. SBT3.3 extracellular local-\n\nization was also confirmed upon expression of a SBT3.3-GFP\n\nprotein fusion in the presence of FM4-64, a plasma membrane\n\nspecific fluorescent dye (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, expression of an\n\nSBT3.3noSP-GFP gene construct in which the N-terminal 25\n\namino acid signal peptide of SBT3.3 has been deleted, revealed\n\nthat the SBT3.3noSP-GFP protein fusion was not secreted to the\n\nextracellular matrix and was retained in the cytoplasm, as\n\ndelineated by the co-localization with FM4-64 (Fig. 4D). These\n\nresults indicate that SBT3.3 is secreted and accumulated in the\n\nplant extracellular matrix, and secretion depends on the presence\n\nof its signal peptide.\n\nFigure 3.

[36] demonstrated that following agro-\n\ninfiltration with a GFP-tagged phytaspase, an Arabidopsis cell\n\ndeath-associated subtilase of similar size to SBT3.3; two proteins of\n\n,110 and ,120 kD corresponding to the mature and the pro-\nprotein phytaspases, respectively, accumulated in crude extracts\n\n[34]. Following expression of SBT3.3-GFP, two similar protein\n\nbands of ,110 and ,120 kD were detected in Western blots using\nan anti-GFP antibody (upper panel; Fig. 4E). The difference\n\nbetween the theoretical mature 98,2 kD SBT3.3-GFP fusion and\n\nthe observed mature 110 kD proteins must be due to posttrans-\n\nlational modifications. In fact, glycosylation was early proposed to\n\nregulate activity of plant subtilases [37,38]. We performed\n\nWestern blots of the same leaf extracts and developed the\n\nnitrocellulose filters with Concanavalin A (Con A) coupled to\n\nhorseradish peroxidase to identify if SBT3.3 is glycosylated. These\n\nanalyses revealed that Con A recognized the 120/110 kD doublet\n\n(Fig. 4E) in extracts expressing the SBT3.3-GFP construct, thus\n\nconfirming that SBT3.3 is glycosylated. Interestingly, Con A also\n\nrecognized a band of ,70 kD that only accumulated following\nSBT3.3-GFP expression (Figure 4E). This ,70 kD band was\nreminiscent of a glycosylated 69 kD P69 subtilase conserved in the\n\nSolanaceous species [27,30]. To verify this possibility, Western\n\nblots were developed with anti-P69C antibodies [30]. Results\n\nrevealed that the ,70 kD Con-A reacting band was recognized by\nanti-P69 antibodies (Fig. 4E) indicating that SBT3.3-GFP signaled\n\ntobacco cells to activate expression of an endogenous P69 subtilase\n\nhomologue. Interestingly, when we extended this analysis to other\n\ndefense-related proteins, i.e. by using antibodies against the PR-1a\n\nisoform from tobacco, we observed that overexpression of SBT3.3-\n\nGFP similarly triggered SA-responsive PR-1a protein accumula-\n\ntion (lower panel; Fig. 4E).

Expression of the missense\n\nmutant in N. benthamiana no longer promoted local accumulation\n\nof the corresponding endogenous P69 subtilase, or the PR-1a\n\nprotein (Supplemental Figure S7). All of these observations are\n\nconsistent with a model in which Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase\n\nlocal expression autonomously triggers immune-like responses in a\n\nheterologous system, and the serine proteolytic activity of the\n\nsubtilase is necessary for this effect. As occurs in SBT3.3OEX1\n\nplants (see below), expression of the SBT3.3-GFP gene construct in\n\ntransgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred enhanced disease resis-\n\ntance to PsDC3000 and is in contrast with the lack of effect\n\nobserved for the SBT3.3m-GFP construct (Supplemental Figure\n\nS8). Moreover, the same SBT3.3-GFP gene construct is able to\n\nabrogate the characteristic enhanced disease susceptibility pheno-\n\ntype of sbt3.3 plants, conferring enhanced disease resistance to\n\nPsDC3000 to the stably transformed sbt3.3 mutant plants\n\n(Supplemental Figure S9). This further indicates functionality of\n\nSBT3.3-GFP fusion protein in promoting immune responses in\n\nArabidopsis.\n\nSBT3.3 artificial expression in transgenic Arabidopsis\ntriggers expression of the endogenous gene\n\nThe above observations indicated that SBT3.3 promotes the\n\nexpression and accumulation of a homologous subtilase (i.e. P69)\n\nin N. benthamiana. We studied a stable transgenic Arabidopsis\n\nline constitutively expressing SBT3.3 under the control of the 35S\n\npromoter (SBT3.3OEX) by measuring activation on the corre-\n\nsponding endogenous SBT3.3 gene to test if the same phenom-\n\nenon could be reproduced in Arabidopsis. Antibodies against\n\nSBT3.3 were not available; therefore we instead performed RT-\n\nqPCR measurements using 2 different pairs of oligonucleotides.\n\nOne of those pairs discriminates between the endogenous SBT3.3\n\nmRNAs (endoSBT3.3), transcribed from its own gene, and the other\n\npair was designed to measure the whole amount of SBT3.3\n\nmRNAs (SBT3.3). In Col-0 plants, as expected, both SBT3.3 and\n\nendoSBT3.3 transcript expression was very low (Fig. 4F). In\n\ncontrast, in the transgenic SBT3.3OEX line, SBT3.3 transcript\n\naccumulation was prominent (Fig. 4F), and importantly, this was\n\nalso followed by a high endoSBT3.3 transcript accumulation. This\n\neffect gives support to the hypothesis that SBT3.3 expression is\n\nable per se to signal its own gene activation. This induction appears\n\n\u2018\u2018self\u2019\u2019 controlled, since endogenous PR-1 transcript levels in\n\ntransgenic plants do not exhibit significant variation with respect\n\nto Col-0 plants (Fig. 4F). However, in agro-infiltrated tobacco\n\nleaves we observed that SBT3.3-GFP expression promotes\n\naccumulation of both the endogenous P69 subtilase homolog,\n\nand the SA-dependent PR-1a protein. This difference can only be\n\nexplained by noting that in the experiments with N. benthamiana, A.\n\ntumefaciens is inevitably present, which in turn may supply PAMPs\n\nin collaboration with SBT3.3, triggering a downstream SA\n\nsignaling pathway, and in turn SA-defense related gene activation.\n\nIf this mechanism operated effectively, then SBT3.3 would be\n\nrequired to facilitate early immune signaling preceding defense\n\nresponse activation.\n\nSBT3.3 overexpression confers enhanced disease\nresistance to PsDC3000 and H. arabidopsidis\n\nTwo independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines that overex-\n\npress SBT3.3 were inoculated with PsDC3000 and disease\n\nresponse recorded to further assess the role of SBT3.3 subtilase\n\nin plant immunity (i.e. SBT3.3OEX1 and SBT3.3OEX2). The\n\nenhanced disease resistance line overexpressing the NPR1\n\nregulator (NPR1-H, [39]), one of the SBT3.3 defective mutants\n\n(i.e. sbt3.3-1), and Col-0 were included in this experiment for\n\ncomparison. Figure 5A shows that the two SBT3.3OEX lines\n\nexhibited significant enhanced disease resistance responses to\n\nPsDC3000 compared to Col-0. This enhanced resistance was of\n\na magnitude similar to that attained by NPR1-H plants. In\n\ncontrast, the sbt3.3-1 mutant reproduced the expected increased\n\ndisease susceptibility previously shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe SBT3.3 overexpressing lines exhibited an enhanced disease\n\nresistance phenotype when exposed to H. arabidopsidis (Fig. 5B).\n\nThe two lines overexpressing SBT3.3 exhibited a significantly\n\nlower colonization of the oomycete than the control Col-0 plants\n\nor the highly susceptible sbt3.3-1 mutant (Fig. 5B). The observed\n\nenhanced disease resistance of sbt3.3-1 to H. arabidopsidis was\n\ncorroborated by directly counting of spore production in\n\ninoculated plants (Supplemental Fig. S5). The observed height-\n\nened resistance against these two pathogens indicated that SBT3.3\n\nfunctions as a positive plant immunity regulator. Furthermore,\n\nwhen the SBT3.3 overexpression phenotype was assayed in an nrp1\n\nor sid2 mutant background, the enhanced disease resistance to\n\nPsDC3000 was abrogated (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that\n\nSBT3.3, as a positive plant immunity regulator, operates upstream\n\nof the SA pathway.\n\nSBT3.3 expression confers enhanced activation of MPK\nkinases\n\nElevated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation\n\nis genuinely linked to IR development [12], and in general to\n\ninnate immune responses [40,41,42]. Therefore, our next objec-\n\ntive was to demonstrate if the enhanced resistance phenotype\n\nmediated by the sole SBT3.3 subtilase expression could elicit\n\nelevated MPKs activation. We subsequently employed an\n\nantibody recognizing the phosphorylated residues within the\n\nMAPK activation loop (the so called pTEpY motif, where p\n\ndenotes the phosphorylated residue). Western blot analysis of\n\nprotein extracts derived from healthy Col-0 plants or from two\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines revealed positive immunoreactive signals in two\n\npolypeptides corresponding to MPK6 and MPK3 [42]. Following\n\ndensitometric scanning of Western blots, the two immunoreactive\n\nbands appeared moderately more intense in the overexpression\n\nlines relative to Col-0 control lines (Fig. 5D\u2013E). Inoculation with\n\nPsDC3000 promoted a further activation-associated dual TEY\n\nphosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6, which was higher in the\n\ntwo SBT3.3OEX lines than in Col-0 plants (Fig. 5D\u2013E). In\n\naddition, MPK4/MPK11, which migrated as a single band on\n\nSDS-PAGE [42], became activated only following bacterial\n\ninoculation, and activation was again more intense in the two\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines. Therefore, dual phosphorylation of the TEY\n\namino acid motif within the MPK activation loop, which is\n\nrequired for kinase activity appeared increased in plants expressing\n\nSBT3.3. However, despite these differences at the protein level, no\n\nsignificant differences were detected with respect to transcript\n\naccumulation induction for these MPKs between Col-0 and\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines (Fig. 5F).\n\nOXI1 is a serine/threonine kinase of the AGC protein kinase\n\nfamily required for oxidative burst-mediated signaling in Arabi-\n\ndopsis; its expression was consistent with that of SBT3.3, and was\n\ninduced by H2O2 ([33]; and Fig. 3B). OXI1 was required for\n\nMPK3 and MPK6 activation and for basal resistance to H.\n\narabidopsidis [33]. In view of these observations, we hypothesized\n\nthat the imposed SBT3.3 expression might sensitize cells to bring\n\nearlier or higher OXI1 expression levels following pathogen\n\ninfection, and in turn provide an explanation for the higher\n\nactivation observed in MPKs. We measured OXI1 comparative\n\nSBT3.3 and Immune Priming\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 8 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\ntranscript level between Col-0 and two SBT3.3OEX lines following\n\nPsDC3000 infection by RT-qPCR. Results indicated the two\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines expressed OXI1 to higher levels than Col-0\n\n(Fig. 5G). This offers a viable explanation as to why MPKs\n\nexhibited increased activation in SBT3.3OEX plants following\n\npathogen attack, even in the absence of differential gene\n\nexpression relative to Col-0. Moreover, in sbt3.3 mutant lines\n\nMPKs activation following inoculation with PsDC3000 was\n\ndrastically reduced in comparison to Col-0 (Figure 5H). This\n\nobservation reinforces the consideration that SBT3.3 appears to\n\nfunction as a positive regulator of the pathway leading to\n\nactivation of MAP kinases. Interestingly, MPKs activation was\n\nnot altered in the enhanced disease susceptibility nrp1 mutant\n\n(Figure 5H) and neither was the expression of the SBT3.3 gene\n\naltered in this same mutant (Figure 3F). This served as a control\n\ntowards the specific requirement of SBT3.3 for MAKs activation\n\nand suggest that this specific signal module operates upstream of\n\nthe NPR1 regulator.\n\nSA-mediated defense genes are poised for enhanced\nactivation in plants overexpressing SBT3.3\n\nThe above results prompted us to search if SA-dependent genes\n\nwere poised for increase activation following SBT3.3 expression.\n\nTherefore, we inoculated Col-0 plants, and one SBT3.3OEX line\n\nwith PsDC3000, and compared PR-1 expression patterns.\n\nInterestingly, after pathogen inoculation induction of PR-1 gene\n\nexpression showed a notorious enhancement in SBT3.3OEX plants\n\nwhen compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the genes encoding\n\nthe transcription factors WRKY6, WRKY53, and WRKY35,\n\nmediating transcriptional regulation of SA-related genes, including\n\nPR-1 [43], themselves induced by pathogen infection [44], showed\n\nsimilar enhanced induced expression in SBT3.3OEX plants\n\n(Fig. 6A). Thus, SBT3.3 mediated poising of defense genes for\n\nenhanced activation following perception of a pathogenic cue,\n\ninvoking a role for SBT3.3 in priming immune responses.\n\nPoising SA\u2013related genes and primed immunity concur in\n\nplants defective in the RdDM pathway, such as mutants affected in\n\ndifferent subunits of the RNA Pol V (i.e. nrpd2) [23], and also\n\nfollowing pharmacological treatment with the priming agent BTH\n\n[20]. In both cases, chromatin histone activation marks appeared\n\nenriched in SA-related gene promoters. Consequently, we\n\nhypothesized that following expression of SBT3.3 SA-related\n\ndefense genes could be poised for enhanced activation by\n\ndifferential histone modification. By using chromatin immunopre-\n\ncipitation (ChIP), we analyzed H3 Lys4 trimethylation\n\n(H3K4me3) and H3 Lys9 acetylation (H3K9ac) on the PR-1,\n\nWRKY6 and WRKY53 gene promoter region in both Col-0 plants\n\nand SBT3.3OEX plants. The enhanced disease resistant mutant\n\nnrpd2, defective in RNA PolV activity and compromised in the\n\nRdDM pathway [23], was included as a control. On the PR-1\n\npromoter, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks increased\n\nmore than two and three-fold, respectively in SBT3.3 overex-\n\npressing plants when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6B). The two\n\nactivation marks were similarly increased in nrpd2 plants, with only\n\nsome differences in intensity (Fig. 6B). As for PR-1, the histone\n\nmarks also showed increases in the WRKY6 and WRKY53\n\npromoters in SBT3.3 overexpressing plants, and to a lesser extent\n\nin nrpd2 plants, relative to Col-0 plants (Fig. 6B). Therefore,\n\nchromatin marks normally associated with active genes abound in\n\nthe promoter regions of SA-related genes in SBT3.3 overexpress-\n\ning plants, although gene activation does not occur in these plants.\n\nThe marks appear to serve as an on-switch for priming, and helps\n\nexplain why the same genes show enhanced induction in\n\nSBT3.3OEX plants upon pathogenic attack (Fig. 6A).\n\nSBT3.3 expression increases H3K4me3 activation marks in\nits own promoter\n\nResults showed the sole expression of SBT3.3 in transgenic\n\nArabidopsis plants was able to promote activation of the\n\nendogenous gene (Figure 4F). Therefore, SBT3.3 per se might\n\nbe signaling chromatin remodeling of its own promoter as it\n\ndoes for the PR-1 gene promoter (Fig. 6B). ChIP for H3K4me3\n\nand H3K9ac marks at the SBT3.3 promoter region in SBT3.3\n\noverexpressing plants revealed that the H3K4me3 mark was\n\nnotably increased compared to Col-0 plants, and moreover, the\n\nenhancement in H3K4me3 marks was mirrored in nrpd2 plants\n\n(Fig. 7A). However, H3K9ac marks in the SBT3.3 gene\n\npromoter did not increase in the SBT3.3 overexpressing plants\n\nand the nrpd2 mutant when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 7A). These\n\nresults contrasted with the common increase of both activation\n\nmarks in the PR-1 gene (Fig. 6B), and suggested the existence of\n\nspecific histone codes regulating gene expression. Alternatively,\n\nbecause the increase in H3K4me3 activation marks observed in\n\nthe SBT3.3 gene promoter between nrpd2 and SBT3.3OEX\n\nplants were matched, we reasoned that nrpd2 plants might also\n\ncarry constitutive SBT3.3 gene expression. SBT3.3 transcript\n\nlevel determination by RT-qPCR in Col-0 and nrpd2 plants\n\nshowed the mutant constitutively expressing SBT3.3 (Fig. 7B).\n\nThese results suggest that SBT3.3 expression is under negative\n\nepigenetic control, and expression is relieved following inhibi-\n\ntion of RdDM. In fact, treatment of Col-0 seedlings with\n\nsulfamethazine (SMZ), a chemical suppressor of epigenetic gene\n\nsilencing (i.e. RdDM) that derepress silenced genes [45],\n\nrelieved SBT3.3 and promoted transcript accumulation\n\n(Fig. 7C), to levels similar to those attained in nrpd2 plants.\n\nThese observations therefore support the contention of an\n\nepigenetic control towards SBT3.3, and indicate that SBT3.3\n\nacts as a positive regulator of a priming phenomenon for more\n\nefficient deployment of immune responses. In addition, a low\n\nconcentration (100 mM) pharmacological treatment with of the\npriming agent BTH administered to Col-0 plants promoted the\n\nenhanced deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks in the\n\nPR-1 gene promoter, and to a minor extent also in WRKY6 and\n\nWRKY53 gene promoters (Fig. 7D), as was observed in previous\n\nstudies [20,23]. Similarly, BTH also induced H3K4me3\n\nactivation marks, and to a less extent also of H3K9ac marks,\n\nin the SBT3.3 gene promoter in Col-0 plants. Thus, as a priming\n\nagent, BTH not only induced chromatin remodeling of SA-\n\nrelated genes similar to the RdDM-defective and enhanced\n\nresistance mutant nrpd2; it also mimicked SBT3.3 chromatin\n\nremodeling triggered by the SBT3.3 itself.\n\nThe importance of SBT3.3 in mediating activation of\n\nchromatin remodeling during priming induction was further\n\nevaluated in SBT3.3 defective plants. Figure 7D, F and G show\n\nthat BTH-mediated increases of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac\n\nactivation marks in the PR-1, WRKY6 and WRKY53 gene\n\npromoters was partially impeded in sbt3.3 plant when\n\ncompared to Col-0 plants. For the SBT3.3 gene promoter\n\n(Fig. 7E), the reduction in histone activation marks following\n\nBTH treatment of sbt3.3 plants was most dramatic. This severe\n\nreduction was most notorious in the case of H3K4me3\n\nactivation marks for which a full inhibition was observed in\n\nBTH-treated sbt3.3 plants when compared to BTH-treated Col-\n\n0 plants (Figure 7D). All the above observations therefore imply\n\nthat the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase is an integral component\n\nmediating establishment of primed immunity, and moreover, it\n\nappears to be targeted for negative epigenetic control of this\n\nsame mechanism.\n\nSBT3.3 and Immune Priming\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nPriming, an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon where cells\n\nrespond to much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more\n\nrapid and robust manner, is an important component of the\n\nvarious forms of IR described in mammals [8\u201310], plants [6,18]\n\nand invertebrates [11]. Despite the importance of priming, the\n\nsignal component(s) mediating this sensitized state remain elusive.\n\nThe sensitized state is in part explained by presumably dormant or\n\nsilent component characters, which accumulate during priming,\n\nand are required only after pathogenic challenge [18]. In this\n\nrespect, pre-stress deposition of two MPK family members of\n\nsignaling enzymes, MPK3 and MPK6, has been described to play\n\nan important role for priming in Arabidopsis [12]. However, it\n\nremains undetermined whether or not activation of additional\n\nfactors operating upstream of the two MPKs is required to\n\nestablish priming.\n\nReverse genetic analysis was applied to identify the Arabidospsis\n\nSBT3.3 gene, encoding a serine protease of the subtilisin clan,\n\nwhich is pivotal in control of a priming mechanism that leads to\n\nsensitization for activation of SA-dependent defense responses and\n\nIR. SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants\n\nelicited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. However, this\n\nenhanced resistance was not preceded by a high constitutive\n\nexpression of SA-responsive genes as occurs in different disease\n\nresistant mutants, which in general carry associated dwarfism, such\n\nas in cpr1, edr1 or csb3 [26, and references therein] to mention a\n\nfew. Instead, the SBT3.3-mediated resistance can be explained by\n\naccelerated and heightened activation of SA-responsive genes,\n\nonly elicited by pathogen inoculation, therefore mimicking a wild\n\ntype plant activated for priming. This phenotype is blocked in a\n\nsid2 mutant background, which lacks SA, and is also blocked in the\n\nnpr1 mutant affected in signaling downstream of SA. SBT3.3 thus\n\nfunctions as a positive regulator of innate immunity operating\n\nupstream of the SA pathway. Consistent with the gain-of-function\n\nphenotype, SBT3.3 suppression impairs induction of SA-respon-\n\nsive genes and causes enhanced susceptibility to infection by\n\npathogens.\n\nInterestingly, SBT3.3 expression is rapidly demanded during\n\nactivation of innate immunity preceding the activation of SA-\n\nresponsive genes. However, in contrast to PR genes, SBT3.3\n\nexpression does not require the SA pathway through the NPR1\n\nregulator. Moreover, SBT3.3 activation responds very rapidly to\n\nH2O2, a common ROS species generated very early during PAMP\n\nrecognition by PRR leading to activation of innate immune\n\nresponses. Consistent with other early induced and SA-indepen-\n\ndent genes [46], H2O2 might be the first signal for early\n\ntranscriptional reprogramming of SBT3.3. Congruently, Daudi et\n\nal. [47] showed that knocking down the Arabidopsis cell wall\n\nperoxidases PRX33/PRX34, required for apoplastic H2O2\ngeneration during innate immune responses, leads to changes in\n\nthe cell wall proteome with depletion of various PAMP-elicited\n\nFigure 6.

Localized\n\nSBT3.3 expression in the heterologous N. benthamiana system led to\n\nexpression of the endogenous P69 homologue. Similarly, its stable\n\nexpression in transgenic plants also led to activation of the\n\nendogenous SBT3.3 gene by what appears to be a self-induction\n\nmechanism, which adds further novelty to the SBT3.3 activation\n\nmode. We hypothesize that to a subsequent initial activation by a\n\npathogen, the expressed SBT3.3 subtilase could initiate a signaling\n\nprocess, which would lead to its own expression, at least to a\n\ncertain threshold level, as if forming a regulatory positive feedback\n\nloop circuit. Maintenance of this expression threshold level should\n\nbe sufficient to keep cells in a sustained sensitized mode. The\n\nautonomous and sustained SBT3.3 expression pattern should\n\nconsequently be the basis to explain the memory-based charac-\n\nteristics of priming and IR, manifested only secondarily in hosts\n\nafter a primary infection. Thus, SBT3.3 appears key in regulating\n\nthis type of training effect leading to IR. Interestingly, MPK3 and\n\nMPK6 activation, and to a lesser extend also MPK4/MPK11,\n\nwere enhanced in SBT3.3OEX plants following infection with\n\nPsDC3000, and conversely, this activation was compromised in\n\nsbt3.3 plants. These results are congruent with increased OXI1\n\nexpression in SBT3.3OEX plants, a kinase required for MPK3 and\n\nMPK6 activation [33], and indicates that following SBT3.3\n\nexpression, plants respond faster to pathogenic stimuli. Because\n\nthe MPK3 and MPK6 activation is critical for priming [12], and\n\nactivation requires OXI1 expression [33], our data suggest\n\nSBT3.3 positively modulates immune responses upstream of the\n\nMAPK kinase pathway, and confirms that accumulation of\n\ndefense signaling components, such as SBT3.3 itself, prior to a\n\nsecondary pathogen challenge is essential for priming and induced\n\nresistance.\n\nSimilarly, the observation that sole SBT3.3 expression poises\n\nSA-responsive defense genes for enhanced activation following\n\nperception of a pathogenic cue provides further support to SBT3.3\n\nas an integral component in mounting primed immunity. ChIP\n\nassays revealed this poising effect for enhanced gene expression\n\ntriggered by SBT3.3 was mediated by selective increases of histone\n\nactivation marks on the promoter region of SA-responsive genes.\n\nSince similar histone activation marks have been found to appear\n\nin SA\u2013related genes when wild type plants are treated with the\n\npriming agent BTH [20], our data therefore strongly support a\n\nmodel where SBT3.3 positively mediates OXI1-mediated MPK\n\nactivation, and concurrent chromatin remodeling at SA-respon-\n\nsive genes as specific hallmarks for primed immunity. Further-\n\nmore, the observation that immune priming, and similar\n\nchromatin remodeling of SA-responsive genes is mirrored in\n\nplants defective in the RdDM pathway [23] provides support for a\n\nhypothesis that the observed SBT3.3-mediated priming mecha-\n\nnism might be under similar epigenetic control. Moreover, the fact\n\nthat SBT3.3 gene expression is constitutively up in the nrpd2\n\nmutant favors this interpretation. Furthermore, (1) the observation\n\nthat histone activation marks are established in the promoter of the\n\nSBT3.3 gene and in the promoters of SA-dependent genes by\n\nindividual SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic plants; (2) the\n\nreproducibility of similar chromatin remodeling of the SBT3.3\n\ngene promoter in nrpd2 plants; (3) its similar remodeling in Col-0\n\nplants following BTH treatment; (4) and the observation that such\n\nchromatin remodeling is strongly abrogated in sbt3.3 plants,\n\nfurther substantiates the importance of SBT3.3 gene activation as\n\na prerequisite for establishment of immune priming.\n\nFigure 7.

One\n\nsimple explanation is via SBT3.3-mediated protein substrate\n\nprocessing that co-localizes extracellularly. This substrate could\n\nexist in a soluble form, or be an extracellular domain (ectodomain)\n\nof a larger protein, likely functioning as a receptor located in the\n\nplasma membrane. After proteolytic shedding of the ectodomain\n\nby SBT3.3, the receptor could become activated and initiate a\n\ndown stream immune signaling process. This mechanism has been\n\nidentified as common in activating a variety of signaling processes\n\nin animal through the involvement of protease-activated receptors\n\n(PARs), a group of receptors mediating different cellular processes\n\nincluding proinflammatory responses, and is also a common\n\nprinciple in various diseases [49]. Moreover, the proteolytic\n\nprocessing mechanism of an extracellular substrate is reminiscent\n\nof that mediating activation of innate immunity in invertebrates\n\nthrough the transmembrane Toll receptor, or Toll-like receptors\n\n(TLRs) in humans; PRR-type receptors consisting of a leucine-rich\n\nrepeat (LRR) ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a\n\ncytosolic signaling domain [Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)], which\n\nbecomes activated only after the binding of a proteolytically\n\nprocessed peptide ligand (i.e. spa\u0308tzle) by complex cascades of\n\nCLIP-domain serine proteases [50] or less common following\n\nspecific cleavage of the receptor ectodomain by extracellular\n\nproteases [51,52]. Alternatively, SBT3.3 processes the extracellu-\n\nlar substrate and the cleaved polypeptide can be released and\n\nfunction as a ligand recognized by a nearby specific extracellular\n\nreceptor, which in turn can initiate a downstream signaling.\n\nTornero et al., [30] reported SBT3.3 homologous P69C subtilase\n\ncan specifically process LRP in disease tomato plants, an\n\nextracellular LRR-containing protein of unknown function, and\n\nthe first subtilase substrate identified in plants. This suggesting\n\nSBT3.3 could similarly be involved in the cleavage and activation\n\nof LRR-containing proteins, including PRR-type receptors, which\n\nin turn may activate innate immune responses. The recent finding\n\nthat the lectin receptor kinase (LecRK)-VI.2, a member of the\n\nLRR-containing superfamily of RLKs proteins existing in\n\nArabidopsis, is required for immune priming acting upstream of\n\nMPK-mediated signaling [53] can give further support to this\n\nhypothesis.\n\nThe results of the present study identified SBT3.3 as a\n\ndeterminant host factor mediating activation of primed immune\n\nresponses. Our immediate future challenge is to identify the target\n\nsubstrate processed by this subtilase and elucidate the mechanism\n\ntransducing the substrate into a signal for immune prime\n\nactivation.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPlants growth conditions\nArabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in\n\na growth chamber (19\u201323uC, 85% relative humidity,\n100 mEm22 sec21 fluorescent illumination) on a 10-hr-light and\n\n14-hr-dark cycle.

Inoculated plants were maintained at 17uC and 100% relative\nhumidity. Disease symptoms were scored for about 200 leaves per\n\ntreatment at 7 days after challenge. For determining leaf\n\ncolonization, infected leaves were stained with lactophenol\n\ntrypan-blue and examined microscopically at 7 days after\n\ninoculation, as described [25] and scored on each leaf in the\n\nfollowing classes: I, no colonization; II, low tissue colonization\n\n(,25% of leaf area colonized); III, medium tissue colonization\n\n(25\u201350% of leaf area colonized); IV, high tissue colonization\n\n(.50% of leaf area colonized). Sporulation was expressed as\n\nintensity of pathogen sporulation on each leaf: I, no sporulation;\n\nII, ,50% of the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; III, .50%\n\nof the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; and IV, heavily\n\ncovered with sporangiophores, with additional chlorosis and leaf\n\ncollapse. When indicated, oomycete spore counting was per-\n\nformed as previously described [26].\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation\nChromatin isolation and immunoprecipitation were performed\n\nas described [55]. Chip samples, derived from three biological\n\nreplicates, were amplified in triplicate and measured by quanti-\n\ntative PCR using primers for PR-1, WRKY6, WRKY53 and Actin2\n\nas reported [21]. The rest of primers are described in Text S1 file.\n\nAll ChIP experiments were performed in three independent\n\nbiological replicates. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation\n\nof modified histones from 2 g of leaf material were antiH3K4m3\n\n(#07-473 Millipore) and antiH3K4ac (#07-352 Millipore).\n\nWestern blot\nProtein crude extracts were prepared by homogenizing ground\n\nfrozen leaf material with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplemented\n\nwith 5 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), and\n\nprotein phosphatase inhibitors (PhosStop, Roche). Protein con-\n\ncentration was measured using Bradford reagent; 25 mg of total\nprotein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide w/v) and\n\ntransferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filter was stained with\n\nPonceau-S after transfer, and used as a loading control.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Pie chart categorizing genes which are\ndifferentially expressed in Col-0 and csb3 plants.

Iron also differentially regulates some trichomonad virulence\nproperties by unknown mechanisms. However, there is evidence to support the existence of gene regulatory mechanisms at the\ntranscriptional and posttranscriptional levels that aremediated by iron concentration inT. vaginalis.Thus, the goal of this study was\nto identify an RNA-binding protein in T. vaginalis that interacts with the tvcp4 RNA stem-loop structure, which may participate\nin a posttranscriptional iron regulatory mechanism mediated by RNA-protein interactions. We performed RNA electrophoretic\nmobility shift assay (REMSA) and supershift, UV cross-linking, Northwestern blot, andwestern blot (WB) assays using cytoplasmic\nprotein extracts from T. vaginalis with the tvcp4 RNA hairpin structure as a probe. We identified a 135-kDa protein isolated by the\nUV cross-linking assays as \ud835\udefc-actinin 3 (TvACTN3) byMALDI-TOF-MS that was confirmed by LS-MS/MS and de novo sequencing.\nTvACTN3 is a cytoplasmic protein that specifically binds to hairpin RNA structures from trichomonads and humans when the\nparasites are grown under iron-depleted conditions.Thus, TvACTN3 could participate in the regulation of gene expression by iron\nin T. vaginalis through a parallel posttranscriptional mechanism similar to that of the IRE/IRP system.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCellular iron is an essential cofactor for many biochemical\nactivities, including oxygen transport, cellular respiration,\nand DNA synthesis. Thus, iron deficiency can cause cell\ngrowth arrest and death. However, iron overload is also\npotentially toxic; under aerobic conditions, it catalyzes the\nformation of reactive oxygen species and generates highly\nreactive radicals through the Fenton reaction [1]. The dual\nrole of this element has led to the evolution of an elegant\nregulatory system that maintains iron homeostasis and con-\ntributes to its systemic balance [2\u20134].\n\nIn vertebrates, cellular iron homeostasis is maintained\nby the coordinated expression of proteins involved in iron\n\nuptake, storage, utilization, and export, which are regulated\nat the posttranscriptional level. This mechanism is based\non the interactions of cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins\n(IRPs) with conserved RNA stem-loop structures known as\niron-responsive elements (IREs), which are located in the\nuntranslated regions (UTRs) of specific mRNAs [4\u20137], under\niron-limited conditions. Depending on the location of the\nRNA hairpin structures at the 5\udba0\udc20- or 3\udba0\udc20-UTRs of mRNA,\nthe regulatory outcomes of these interactions are (a) the\ntranslation inhibition of 5\udba0\udc20-UTR IRE-containingmRNAs and\n(b) the protection and stability of 3\udba0\udc20-UTR IRE-containing\nmRNAs [3].\n\nThe IRE/IRP interaction in the 5\udba0\udc20-UTR modulates the\nexpression of mRNAs encoding H- and L-ferritin (IRE-fer),\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nBioMed Research International\nVolume 2014, Article ID 424767, 20 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/424767\n\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\nALAS2, m-aconitase, ferroportin, HIF-2\ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd-APP, and \ud835\udefc-\nsynuclein, which control iron storage, erythroid iron utiliza-\ntion, energy homeostasis, iron efflux, hypoxic responses, and\nneurological pathways. Conversely, the IRE/IRP interaction\nin the 3\udba0\udc20-UTR stabilizes mRNAs encoding TfR1, DMT1,\nCdc14A, andMRCK\ud835\udefc, which are involved in iron uptake, iron\ntransport, the cell cycle, and cytoskeletal remodeling [7].\n\nThere are two cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins in\nvertebrates, namely, IRP-1 and IRP-2. IRP-1 (97 kDa) and IRP-\n2 (105 kDa) share \u223c57% sequence identity with one another\nand \u223c31% sequence identity with mitochondrial aconitase,\nbut only IRP-1 has retained its cytoplasmic aconitase activity\n[7]. Although IRP-1 and IRP-2 are similar in sequence and\nstructure, their actions are significantly different. IRP-1 con-\ntains a [4Fe-4S] cluster, and high iron concentrations prevent\nIRE-protein interactions [8]. In vitro studies have revealed\nthat the iron-sulfur cluster can be disassembled in the\npresence of oxidizing (NO and H\n\n2\nO\n2\n) and reducing agents,\n\nsuch as\ud835\udefd-mercaptoethanol, resulting in greater IRE affinity at\nhigh iron concentrations [9, 10]. At low iron concentrations,\nthe iron-sulfur cluster is labile and disassembled, and the\nRNAbinding site is exposed at the IRP, enabling RNA-protein\ninteractions [10]. By contrast, IRP-2 binding to IRE structure\nis not regulated by the assembly and disassembly of an iron-\nsulfur cluster.\n\nTrichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protist parasite\nresponsible for trichomoniasis, one of the most common\nnonviral sexually transmitted infections in humans. This\nprotist is dependent on high levels of iron, favoring its growth\nandmultiplication in culture and in the human vagina, where\nthe iron concentration is constantly changing throughout\nthe menstrual cycle. Iron also differentially regulates some\ntrichomonad virulence properties by unknown mechanisms\n[11, 12]. Knowledge of iron gene expression regulation in T.\nvaginalis is still very limited.\n\nThere is evidence to support the existence of gene regu-\nlatory mechanisms at the transcriptional and posttranscrip-\ntional levels that are mediated by iron concentration in T.\nvaginalis. An iron-responsive promoter and the regulatory\nproteins that interact with it are involved in the positive tran-\nscriptional regulation of ap65-1 gene expression by iron [13],\nbut this system is specific to this particular gene. Moreover,\nan atypical IRE hairpin structure has been reported in the\nmRNA of cysteine proteinase 4 (TvCP4) that is upregulated\nby iron at the posttranscriptional level. This atypical IRE\nstructure specifically interacts with human IRP-1 and also\nappears to interact with trichomonad cytoplasmic proteins\nfrom parasites grown under iron-restricted conditions [11].\nHowever, the specificity and identity of these proteins are\nunknown because T. vaginalis lacks aconitase activity and\ngenes encoding IRP-like proteins. Interestingly, these tri-\nchomonad cytoplasmic proteins also specifically interact\nwith human IRE-fer. Taken together, these data suggest the\nexistence of a posttranscriptional iron regulatory mechanism\nin T. vaginalis that is parallel to the typical IRE/IRP system\n[11, 12].\n\nTherefore, the goal of this work was to identify at least\none of the cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins of T. vaginalis\nthat interacts with these IRE structures to provide insight\n\ninto the posttranscriptional iron regulatory mechanism of\nthis early-evolved protist parasite. UsingRNAelectrophoretic\nmobility shift assay (REMSA) and supershift, UV cross-\nlinking, and Northwestern blot (NWB) assays in concert\nwith mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we identified and\ncharacterized the 135-kDa cytoplasmic protein \ud835\udefc-actinin\n(TvACTN3), which has the ability to bind to RNA and\ncould participate in the posttranscriptional iron regulatory\nmechanism of T. vaginalis.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Parasite and HeLa Cell Cultures. T. vaginalis parasites\nfrom a fresh clinical CNCD 147 isolate were cultured in\ntrypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium [14] sup-\nplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum\n(HIHS) and incubated at 37\u2218C for 24 h. Regular TYM-\nHIHS medium contains 20 \ud835\udf07M iron [14, 15]. Parasites in\nthe logarithmic phase of growth were also cultured in iron-\ndepleted or iron-rich conditions (0 or 250\ud835\udf07M iron, resp.),\nand the culture medium was supplemented with 150 \ud835\udf07M\n2,2\udba0\udc20-dipyridyl (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., St. Louis, MO, USA)\nor 250\ud835\udf07M ferrous ammonium sulfate (J. T. Baker, USA)\nsolutions, respectively, 24 h prior to parasite inoculation [11,\n15]. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\nmedium (DMEM) (Invitrogen-Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA),\nsupplemented with 10% HIHS at 37\u2218C for 48 h in a 5% CO\n\n2\n\natmosphere to obtain confluent cell monolayers [16].\n\n2.2. Parasite Cell Fractionation. Parasite cell fractionation\nwas performed by combining previously described methods\n[17] with a few modifications. In brief, T. vaginalis parasites\n(5\u00d7108 with a cell density of 1.5\u00d7106 parasites/mL) cultured\nunder different iron conditions were harvested at 750\u00d7g for\n5min at 4\u2218C and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.0.The\nparasite pellet was resuspended in 1mL of extraction buffer\n(EB) (10mMHEPES (pH 7.6), 3mMMgCl\n\n2\n, 40mMKCl, 5%\n\nglycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40; Sigma) containing protease\ninhibitors (7.5mM TLCK and 1.6mM leupeptin; Sigma),\nvortexed, and incubated for 20min on ice.The parasite lysate\nwas centrifuged for 10min at 1,000\u00d7g.The pellet (P1: nucleus\nand cell debris) was discarded. The supernatant (SN1) was\ncentrifuged for 10min at 10,000\u00d7g, and the new supernatant\n(SN2: cytoplasmic extracts) was stored at \u221270\u2218C for up to\ntwo weeks until use in REMSA and supershift, UV cross-\nlinking, andNWB assays.The pellet (P2: membrane extracts)\nwas resuspended in 750\ud835\udf07L buffer R (20mMHEPES (pH 7.6),\n2mMMgCl\n\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA) and stored at \u221270\u2218C until use.\n\n2.3. Cytoplasmic Extracts from HeLa Cells. HeLa cell cyto-\nplasmic extracts were prepared as previously described [11].\nIn brief, HeLa cells (40 \u00d7 106 with a cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 106\ncells/mL) were detached with 0.05M EDTA, for 5min at\n25\u2218C, centrifuged at 2,500\u00d7g for 5min at 4\u2218C and washed\ntwice with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in\nlysis buffer A (10mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 15mM MgCl\n\n2\n, and\n\n10mM KCl), homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (10\u2013\n20 strokes), and centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 30min at 4\u2218C.\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\nThe supernatantswere diluted to a final protein concentration\nof 10mg/mL and stored at \u221270\u2218C until use.\n\n2.4. In Vitro Transcription of RNA Sequences. The DNA\nused for in vitro transcription included the following: the\nplasmid pSPT-fer (kindly donated byDr. Lukas Ku\u0308hn), which\ncontains the human ferritin H-chain IRE (IRE-fer) region\nwas linearized with BamHI [18], and two tvcp4 amplicons,\nnamely, (i) amplicon 31 from \u22123 to 28 nt (including the IRE-\ntvcp4 sequence) and (ii) amplicon 97 from 12 to 107 nt (a\ndeletion mutant that disrupts IRE-tvcp4) [11]. The amplicons\nwere produced by PCR with the primers sense (31), antisense\n(31), sense (97), and antisense (97) (Table 1). The PCR sense\nprimers contained a bacteriophage T7 promoter sequence\n(underline nt) and an additional GG sequence to enhance\ntranscription.The purified PCR products (Qiaquick kit, Qia-\ngenMexico, S. de R.L. de C.V.Mexico) were used as templates\nfor RNAsynthesis using an in vitro transcription kit (Ambion,\nInc. Austin, TX, USA). The transcription reaction was con-\nducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\nFollowing transcription, the DNA templates were removed\nby treatment with DNase I (Ambion), and unincorporated\nnucleotides were removed by precipitation with 5\ud835\udf07g glyco-\ngen, 100mM ammonium acetate salts, and two volumes of\nabsolute ethanol. To synthesize radiolabeled RNA transcripts,\n20\ud835\udf07Ci [\ud835\udefc32P] UTP (800Ci/mmol; Dupont Mexico, S.A. de\nC.V., Mexico) was included in the transcription reaction.\nThe IRE-fer transcript encoding the canonical IRE was used\nas the positive control where indicated. An unrelated RNA\ntranscript was used as a negative control [19]. To obtain the\nRNA secondary structure, transcripts were incubated at 70\u2218C\nfor 15min and cooled down at room temperature for 20min.\n\n2.5. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (REMSA) and\nSupershift Assay. REMSA assays were performed to detect\nRNA-protein interactions as reported by Leibold and Munro\n[20] with some modifications. In brief, 200,000 cpm (10\u2013\n15 ng) of 32P-UTP-labeled RNAs was incubated for 20min\nat 4\u2218C with 20\ud835\udf07g cytoplasmic HeLa cell extracts or 50\ud835\udf07g\nT. vaginalis cytoplasmic extracts from parasites grown in\niron-rich and iron-depleted conditions in interaction buffer\n(10mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 3mM MgCl\n\n2\n, 40mM KCl, 5%\n\nglycerol in DEPC water) in the presence of 20U RNasin\n(Roche), 4 \ud835\udf07g tRNA, and 2% \ud835\udefd-mercaptoethanol (only for\nassessing interactions in the HeLa cytoplasmic extract). After\nincubation, 20U RNase T1 and 10\ud835\udf07g RNase A were added\nto the mixture and incubated for 30min at 25\u2218C. Then,\nheparin (5 \ud835\udf07g) was added and incubated for 10min at 4\u2218C.\nThe RNA-protein complexes (RPCs) were resolved on 6%\nnondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autora-\ndiography [18]. To assess specificity, competition REMSAs\nwere performed by adding 50 and 100-fold molar excesses of\nunlabeled RNA, followed by incubation for 30min at 4\u2218C. For\nthe supershift assays, 1-2\ud835\udf07L (1 \ud835\udf07g/\ud835\udf07L) commercial polyclonal\nantibody against recombinant \ud835\udefc-actinin from chicken (\ud835\udefc-\nchACTN, PA1-28036,Thermo Scientific), a monoclonal anti-\nbody against recombinant \ud835\udefc-actinin from bovine ([BM 75.2],\nAbcam), 5\u201315\ud835\udf07L rabbit \ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r serum, or 10 \ud835\udf07L control\n\nrabbit against T. vaginalis triosephosphate isomerase 2r (\ud835\udefc-\nTvTIM2r) serum [21] (as an unrelated antibody) was added,\nalong with the cytoplasmic extracts from trichomonads\ngrown in iron-depleted conditions, before adding the RNA\nprobes. These experiments were independently performed at\nleast three times, with similar results.\n\n2.6. UV Cross-Linking Assay. Trichomonad cytoplasmic\nextracts and the recombinant proteins TvACTN3r, the\nTvACTN3 domains (DIr, DIIr, and DIIIr), hIRP-1r (used\nas a positive control), and BSA (1\ud835\udf07g) (used as a negative\ncontrol) were incubated with 200,000 cpm (10\u201315 ng) 32P-\nlabeled RNA probes for 30min at 4\u2218C in 25 \ud835\udf07L reaction\nbuffer (10mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 3mM MgCl\n\n2\n, 5%\n\n(v/v) glycerol, 100mM KCl, 20U RNasin, and 5 \ud835\udf07g yeast\ntRNA; Invitrogen). After RNA-binding, the reaction mixture\nwas placed on ice and irradiated with a UV-lamp (UVP;\n800,000\ud835\udf07J/cm2) for 15min. Unprotected RNA was digested\nfor 30min at 25\u2218Cwith RNase A (10 \ud835\udf07g) and RNase T1 (20U).\nRPCs were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were\nstained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) and dried, and\nradioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography in a\nFLA 5000 phosphoimager (Fujifilm, Co, Tokyo Japan) with\na Software MultiGauge V3.0 [22]. These experiments were\nindependently performed at least three times, with similar\nresults.\n\n2.7. Identification of RNA-Binding Proteins in T. vaginalis. The\nhigh molecular weight protein bands detected by UV cross-\nlinking assays of the cytoplasmic proteins from trichomonads\ngrown under iron-depleted conditions and the IRE-tvcp4\nRNAprobewere excised fromduplicate CBB-stained gels and\nsubmitted to protein identification by MS at the Protein Unit\nof Columbia University (New York, USA).The protein bands\nwere reduced and alkylated, digested with trypsin, and ana-\nlyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of\nflight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), MS/MS and de\nnovo sequencing as previously reported [23, 24]. The specific\npeptides identified (Table 2) corresponded to the TvACTN3\nprotein. The score and protein coverage were calculated by\nthe MS-Fit MOWSE and Mascot search algorithms.\n\n2.8. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant TvACTN3r,\nDIr, DIIr, and DIIIr Proteins. The complete tvactn3 gene\n(TVAG 239310; 3390 bp) was amplified by PCR using\ngenomic DNA from the T. vaginalis CNCD 147 isolate as a\ntemplate with a sense primer containing a BamHI restriction\nsite (tvactn3-BamHI) and an antisense primer containing a\nNotI restriction site (tvactn3-NotI); these primers included\nthe ATG and TAA initiation and stop codons, respectively\n(Table 1). The corresponding DNA fragments of Domain I\n(873 bp, 1\u2013291 aa), Domain II (1713 bp, 230\u2013800 aa), and\nDomain III (1407 bp, 662\u20131129 aa) were also amplified by\nPCR using plasmid DNA (containing the complete tvactn3\ngene) with specific primers for each fragment (Table 1). The\namplicons were cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invit-\nrogen). The inserts were released by double digestion and\nsubcloned into the pProEX-HTb expression vector according\n\n\n\n4 BioMed Research

instructions (Invitrogen). The DNA\nsequence of tvactn3was deposited inGenBankwith accession\nnumber KF280188. His-tagged recombinant TvACTN3r, DIr,\nDIIr, and DIIIr were expressed in E. coli BL-21 (DE3) by\ninduction with 1mM IPTG for 16 h at 16\u2218C.The recombinant\nproteins were purified from the soluble fraction by affinity\nchromatography using Ni-NTA-Sepharose as recommended\nby the manufacturer (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp,\nPiscataway NJ, USA). Purified recombinant proteins were\ndialyzed three times against PBS at 4\u2218C and quantified by the\nBradford method (Bio-Rad).\n\n2.9. Generation of Anti-TvACTN3r, DIr, DIIr, and DIIIr Anti-\nbodies. Female New Zealand white rabbits weighing 3.0 kg\nwere intramuscularly immunized twice with 300 \ud835\udf07g affinity-\npurified TvACTN3r, DIr, DIIr, or DIIIr proteins in a 1 : 1 ratio\nwith TiterMax Gold (Sigma) adjuvant, as recommended by\nthe manufacturer. The animals were bled weekly, and their\nsera were tested by WB assays against each recombinant\nprotein and cytoplasmic extracts from T. vaginalis cultured\nin regular medium. Before rabbit immunization, the preim-\nmune (PI) serum was obtained from each rabbit and used as\na negative control for all experiments with antibodies.\n\n2.10. Antibodies. To detect the presence of cross-reacting\nIRP-1-like proteins inT. vaginalis, we used an affinity-purified\nrabbit polyclonal antibody against rat IRP-1 (rIRP-1, AB15506,\nMillipore). We also used a rabbit polyclonal antibody against\n\ud835\udefc-chACTN. In addition, rabbit polyclonal antisera were\nproduced against purified recombinant TvACTN3r and its\ndomains (\ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r, \ud835\udefc-DIr, \ud835\udefc-DIIr, and \ud835\udefc-DIIIr). To\nproduce control sera for the western blot (WB) assays of\ndifferent cellular fractions, we used a mouse polyclonal\nantibody against a trichomonad PFO A protein for the\nmembrane fraction [23] and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum\nagainst a trichomonad cytoplasmicHSP70 protein (produced\nby Torres-Romero et al., manuscript in preparation) for the\ncytoplasmic fraction. To produce a negative control serum\nfor the supershift assays, we used a rabbit polyclonal antibody\nagainst the recombinant TvTIM2r protein [21].\n\n2.11. Western Blotting. After electrophoresis, recombinant\nTvACTN3r, DIr, DIIr, or DIIIr, or cytoplasmic extracts of T.\nvaginalis grown in 0, 20, or 250 \ud835\udf07M iron were transferred\nonto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes and blocked using 10%\nfat-free milk in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) buffer for\n18 h at 4\u2218C. The NC membranes were washed five times\nwith PBS-T at 25\u2218C and incubated for 18 h at 4\u2218C with each\nantibody. The antibodies were diluted in PBS-T as follows:\n\ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r (1 : 150,000), \ud835\udefc-DIr (1 : 1,000), \ud835\udefc-DIIr (1 : 1,000),\nand \ud835\udefc-DIIIr (1 : 1,000). The NC membranes were washed\nfive times with PBS-T at 25\u2218C, incubated with secondary\nantibodies (\ud835\udefc-rabbit or \ud835\udefc-mouse immunoglobulin Gs [IgGs]\ncoupled to peroxidase) (Bio-Rad) at a 1 : 3,000 dilution in\n10% fat-free milk in PBS-T for 2 h at 25\u2218C, washed five times\nwith PBS-T, and developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Bio-\nRad) or by chemiluminescence using a SuperSignal West\nPico Kit (Pierce). The corresponding PI rabbit or mouse\n\nserumwas used as a negative control.These experiments were\nindependently performed at least three times and yielded\nsimilar results.\n\n2.12. Northwestern Blotting (NWB). The Northwestern blot\nassay was performed by combining previously described\nmethods [17, 24] with a few modifications. In brief, recom-\nbinant proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred\nonto NC membranes, blocked with 10% fat-free milk and\n20\ud835\udf07g/mL yeast tRNA (Sigma) in EB (EBY) for 18 h at 4\u2218C, and\nwashed three times with EBY at 25\u2218C. The NC membranes\nwere incubated for 18 h at 4\u2218C with EBY containing 10\u2013\n15 ng/mL radiolabeled RNA; washed twice with EB; washed\nanother two times with B buffer (10mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]\nand 50mM NaCl); and blocked again for 1 h at 37\u2218C with\nSTMT buffer (1M NaCl, 0.1M Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 2mM\nMgCl\n\n2\n, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 3% BSA. After\n\nextensivewashingwith EB, theNCmembraneswere air-dried\nand exposed for autoradiography. These experiments were\nperformed independently at least three times, with similar\nresults.\n\n2.13. In Silico Analysis of TvACTN3. Multiple alignments\nwere performed with the ClustalW program. The nucleotide\nsequences of all tvactn genes were obtained from the T.\nvaginalis genome project database (http://www.trichdb.org/).\nTo identify functional RNA-binding domains, we analyzed\nthe deduced protein sequence of TvACTN3 using the\nSMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) [26, 27], Motif\nScan (http://hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN), and PROSITE\nprograms (http://prosite.expasy.org/prosite.html) [28].\n\n2.14. RNA Isolation, Semiquantitative RT-PCR, and Real-\nTime qRT-PCR Analyses. The total RNA from parasites (107)\ngrown in 0, 20, or 250\ud835\udf07M iron was extracted using TRIzol\nreagent (Sigma). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the total\nRNA (1 \ud835\udf07g) was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript\nII reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) and an oligo (dT18)\nprimer. A 0.5 \ud835\udf07g quantity of cDNA was then used as a\nPCR template [25]. Gene-specific primers [29] were used\nfor PCR amplification of the T. vaginalis \ud835\udefc-actinin (tvactn1,\ntvactn2, tvactn3, tvactn4, and tvactn5) transcripts (Table 1).\nTo produce an internal control, a 112-bp fragment of the \ud835\udefd-\ntubulin genewas amplified by PCRwith specific primers [25].\nAs additional controls, the tvpfo a (iron-upregulated gene)\n[23] and tvcp12 (iron-downregulated gene) transcripts were\nalso amplified using specific primers [11] (Table 1).\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR was performed for each tvactn\ngene using an ABIPRISM 7300 Sequence Detector (Applied\nBiosystems). In brief, the RT-PCR amplification mixtures\n(25 \ud835\udf07L) contained 1 \ud835\udf07g cDNA from each condition; 10 pmol\nspecific primers for tvactn1, tvactn2, tvactn3, tvactn4, or\ntvactn5 (Table 1); and 2\u00d7 SYBR Green 1 PCR Master Mix\n(12.5 \ud835\udf07L) buffer (Applied Biosystems).The cycling conditions\nfor all tvactn genes and transcripts included 10min of poly-\nmerase activation at 95\u2218C, followed by 25 cycles of 95\u2218C for\n20 s, 55\u2218C for 30 s, and 72\u2218C for 30 s. Each assay (in triplicate)\nincluded a standard curve of eight 1/10 serial dilutions of\n\n\n\n6 BioMed Research International\n\ntvactn3 or \ud835\udefd-tub cDNA (1 \ud835\udf07g of each tested cDNA) and\na no-template control. All PCR efficiencies were greater\nthan 95%. The results obtained by the Sequence Detection\nSoftware (version 1.3; Applied Biosystems) were exported\nas tab-delimited text and imported into Microsoft Excel for\nfurther analysis. To confirm the amplification specificity, PCR\nproducts were subjected to standard curve analysis.The levels\nof tvactn1, tvactn2, tvactn3, tvactn4, or tvactn5 mRNA were\nquantified by qRT-PCR analysis relative to \ud835\udefd-tubulin mRNA\nas an internal control.\n\n2.15. Statistical Analysis. All data were expressed as the\nmeans \u00b1 S.D. from three samples, and qRT-PCR experiments\nwere repeated three times. The significance of the difference\nbetween means was determined by one-way ANOVA using\nSigma-Plot11.The level of significancewas also determined by\nthe Bonferroni method comparing all groups versus control\n(\ud835\udc43 < 0.001) for Figure 4(b). The scores showing statistical\nsignificance are indicated in the figures with asterisks.\n\n2.16. Ethical Statement. This study was performed with strict\naccordance with the recommendations of the Guide for\nthe Use of Laboratory Animals of the Center of Research\nand Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute\n(CINVESTAV-IPN). The protocols and experiments were\napproved by the Institutional Animal Care \u201cCICUAL\u201d at the\nCINVESTAV-IPN. Animals were kept in environmentally\ncontrolled animal facilities at CINVESTAV-IPN. The final\nbleeding was performed under sodium pentobarbital anes-\nthesia and efforts were always made to minimize suffering.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Cytoplasmic Proteins from T. vaginalis Grown in Iron-\nDepleted Concentrations Specifically Interact with IRE-tvcp4\nand IRE-fer. We previously demonstrated the specific inter-\naction between an atypical IRE stem-loop structure in the 5\udba0\udc20\nregion of tvcp4 mRNA with human recombinant IRP and\nHeLa cell cytoplasmic proteins, which suggested the pres-\nence of RNA-binding proteins in trichomonad cytoplasmic\nextracts [11]. To determine if T. vaginalis has RNA-binding\nproteins that specifically interact with IRE structures andmay\nparticipate in a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism\nparallel to the IRE-IRP system described in other organisms,\nwe performed REMSA with cytoplasmic extracts from T.\nvaginalis grown in iron-rich (Tv-H) and iron-depleted (Tv-L)\nmedia and radiolabeled RNA probes of trichomonad IRE-\ntvcp4, and the human IRE-fer that was used as a positive\ncontrol. Figure 1(a) shows the formation of one RNA-protein\ncomplex (RPC) with T. vaginalis cytoplasmic extracts under\niron-depleted conditions using both probes (lanes 3 and 6);\nthe complexes were sensitive to reducing agents (data not\nshown). These results suggest that there are RNA-binding\nproteins in the trichomonad extracts that interact with\nhairpin RNA structures in iron-depleted conditions and in\nthe absence of reducing agents.\n\nRNA competition assays were also performed to deter-\nmine the specificity of the RPC formed between the tri-\nchomonad cytoplasmic proteins and both tested IREs. The\naddition of a molar excess of unlabeled homologous or\nheterologous IRE probe (IRE-fer and IRE-tvcp4) relative\nto labeled IRE significantly decreased the amount of RPC\n(Figure 1(b), lanes 3\u20136 and 11\u201314, resp.) in a concentration-\ndependent manner. An excess of unlabeled unrelated tran-\nscripts was used as competitor RNA [19], which did not\naffect RPC formation, as expected (Figure 1(b), lanes 7, 8 and\n15, 16, resp.). These data demonstrate that the RNA-protein\ncomplexes detected with trichomonad cytoplasmic proteins\nare specific and imply the existence of RNA-binding proteins\nin T. vaginalis, in spite of the lack of aconitase/IRP proteins in\ntrichomonads.\n\n3.2. IRE-tvcp4 and IRE-fer mRNA Probes Specifically Interact\nwith at Least Four Protein Bands from T. vaginalis Extracts.\nTo determine the size of the proteins in the RPC, UV cross-\nlinking assays were performed using cytoplasmic extracts\nfromT. vaginalis grown in iron-depleted conditions and radi-\nolabeled IRE-tvcp4 and IRE-fer mRNA probes. Figure 2(a)\nshows that both RNA probes interacted with at least four\nproteins of 135, 110, 70, and 45 kDa (lanes 2 and 7).The45-kDa\nprotein band was more intense in the presence of IRE-tvcp4\nthan in the presence of IRE-fer.Thepresence of reactive bands\nrequired the simultaneous occurrence of RNA and protein\nmolecules during UV irradiation. Few or no reactive bands\nwere observed when the cross-linking reaction was treated\nwith proteinase K (lanes 3 and 8) or RNases (lanes 4 and 9) or\nwhen unlabeled IREs were used (lanes 5 and 10), indicating\nthat the radioactive bands were formed when cytoplasmic\ntrichomonad proteins and labeled-RNA were present in the\nreaction and specifically interacted with one another.\n\n3.3. The 135-kDa Protein Band That Binds to IRE-tvcp4 and\nIRE-fer Is a T. vaginalis \ud835\udefc-Actinin (TvACTN3). To identify\nthe 135-kDa protein detected in the UV cross-linking assays\n(Figure 2(a)), the corresponding protein band was excised\nfrom the duplicate CBB-stained gel and prepared for MS\nanalysis by tryptic mapping of the 135-kDa protein band\nby MALDI-TOF-MS, MS/MS and de novo sequencing. The\nmasses of 35 peptides obtained from the 135-kDa protein\nband corresponded to peptidemasses from theTVAG 239310\ncytoplasmic TvACTN3 ofT. vaginalis [29]. Only 1/35 peptides\n(peptide 33) was common to TvACTN1 and 2/35 peptides\n(peptides 4 and 34) were common to TvACTN2 (Table 2).\nNone of the identified peptides were found in TvACTN4\nand TvACTN5. The protein sequence coverage was 43%\nwith a MS-Fit MOWSE score: 2.64\ud835\udc52 + 11; Mascot score:\n212, and expected value 5.8\ud835\udc52 \u2212 15. To confirm this identi-\nfication, the 135-kDa protein band was processed by ESI-\nLC-MS/MS. A single peptide: FMIEEISVEEATAR (peptide\n4) was identified. This peptide was common to \ud835\udefc-actinin\nTvACTN2 and TvACTN3 of T. vaginalis. Since only one\npeptide was obtained, a new analysis by de novo sequencing\nwas performed and four peptide sequences: EEYNQAAQK,\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 7\n\n++\n\n+\n\n+\n++ +\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212 \u2212\n\n\u2212 +\u2212\u2212\n+ \u2212\u2212 + \u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212IRE-fer\nIRE-tvcp4\nTv-H\nTv-L\n\nFree \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nprobe\n\nI I\n\n(a)\n\nIRE-fer\nIRE-tvcp4\n\nIR\nE-\n\ntv\ncp\n4\n\nTv-L\n\nU\nR\n\n+ + ++ + +\n\n++++++ ++\n++++++ ++\n\n\u2212\u2212\n++ + ++ + +\u2212 ++ + ++ + +\u2212\n\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\nFree \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nCompetitors\n\nprobe\n\nIR\nE-\n\nfe\nr\n\nIR\nE-\n\ntv\ncp\n4\n\nU\nR\n\nIR\nE-\n\nfe\nr\n\n+ + ++ + +\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\nII\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: Presence of RNA-binding proteins in iron-depleted T. vaginalis.

Experiments with IRE-fer are controls. RNA free probes used\nas negative controls (lanes 1 and 4). (b) REMSA competition assays performed with the IRE-fer and IRE-tvcp4 RNA probes and T. vaginalis\ncytoplasmic extracts in the absence of competitors (lanes 2 and 10) or in the presence of a 50- or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled IRE-fer\nRNA (lanes 3 and 4), IRE-tvcp4 (lanes 13 and 14), or unrelated transcript (lanes 7, 8 and 15, 16). A cross-competition assay in the presence of\na 50- or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled IRE-tvcp4 RNA (lanes 5 and 6) and IRE-fer RNA (lanes 11 and 12). Experiments were performed\nthree times and yielded similar results.\n\nTAIAAEK, QECLDVINTER, and IQPTLEEPYQ that corre-\nsponded to TvACTN3 of T. vaginalis were obtained. Two\nof them were part of the sequence of peptides 18 and 23\nidentified by MALDI TOF (Table 2).\n\nTo confirm this identification, we performed a WB assay\nusing a commercial polyclonal antibody against recombinant\nchicken \ud835\udefc-actinin (\ud835\udefc-chACTN) with cytoplasmic extracts\nfrom iron-depleted T. vaginalis. This antibody recognized\nprotein bands of 135, 110, 65, and 40 kDa (Figure 2(b), lane\n3). Similar molecular weight protein bands (135, 110, 60, and\n50 kDa) were also detected with a commercial polyclonal \ud835\udefc-\nrIRP-1 antibody (Figure 2(b), lane 4). Interestingly, these two\nantibodies showed cross-reactivity to the 135- and 110-kDa\nprotein bands of T. vaginalis.\n\n3.4. Actinin Proteins from T. vaginalis Are Present in the RNA-\nProtein Complex Formed between Cytoplasmic Extracts and\nRNA Probes from Humans and Trichomonads. To corrobo-\nrate the presence of actinin in the RPC formed between tri-\nchomonad cytoplasmic proteins and RNA probes (IRE-tvcp4\nand IRE-fer), a supershift assay was performed by adding\n\nthe \ud835\udefc-chACTN polyclonal antibody and the \ud835\udefc-bACTN\nmonoclonal antibody to the REMSA reaction. Figure 2(c)\nshows that both heterologous anti-ACTN polyclonal and\nmonoclonal antibodies reduced RPC formation between the\ncytoplasmic extracts of iron-depleted T. vaginalis and both\nIRE probes (lanes 3\u20136 and 9\u201312, resp.) at two antibody\nconcentrations; an unrelated antibody was used as a negative\ncontrol (lane 13). These results confirm the presence of\ntrichomonad \ud835\udefc-actinins in the RPC.\n\n3.5.

Principal motifs of the deduced amino acid sequences of the five\ntvactn genes reported in the T. vaginalis genome sequence [29]. TvACTN1 (609 aa), TvACTN2 (931 aa), TvACTN3 (1129 aa), TvACTN4 (1137\naa), and TvACTN5 (1271 aa). By SMART, MOTIF SCAN, and PROSITE programs, we found the principal motif sequences present in the\nfive TvACTNs proteins, two calponin domains (CH) at the N-terminus followed by variable spectrin repeats (SR) in the central rod domain,\nand two EF-hands: EF-hand (E) and calcium-insensible EF-hand (EF) at the C-terminus. TvACTN4 and TvACTN5 present more divergent\ncentral region and C-terminus. TvACTN4 has one coiled coil (C) and nine SEL domains (S), and TvACTN5 presents seven C2 domains (C2).\n\n1129, 1137, and 1271 amino acid [aa] residues, resp.) and\ndifferent identities compared with TvACTN3 (55.19, 53.25,\n22.1, and 15.56% with TvACTN1, TvACTN2, TvACTN4,\nand TvACTN5, resp.). All of the proteins have two calponin\ndomains (CH) at the N-terminus that confer the ability to\nbind actin, followed by spectrin repeats (SR) in the central\nrod domain and two EF-hands (EF-H) at the C-terminus.\nThe number of spectrin repeats is variable in TvACTN2 and\nTvACTN3, and the central domain of TvACTN1, TvACTN4,\nand TvACTN5 has different specific domains compared to\nthe other \ud835\udefc-actinins (Figure 3).\n\nWe then analyzed which of the T. vaginalis actn genes are\nexpressed under different iron concentrations. Semiquanti-\ntative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR assays using specific primers\nfor each tvactn gene (Table 1) were performed using RNA\nisolated from trichomonads grown in 0, 20, or 250 \ud835\udf07M iron.\nFigure 4(a) shows that the T. vaginalis tvactn1, tvactn2, and\ntvactn3 genes were better expressed in the presence of iron\n(lanes 2 and 3) than under iron-depleted conditions (lane\n1). Neither tvactn4 nor tvactn5 was expressed under these\nexperimental conditions (lanes 1\u20133). The expected control\ntvactn1\u20135 gene fragments were amplified from genomic\nDNA. The level of the \ud835\udefd-tubulin transcript in the same RNA\nsamples at each iron concentration was used to normalize\nthe transcript quantities. Two genes differentially regulated\nby iron were also used as controls (tvpfo a for positiveand\ntvcp12 for negative iron regulation, resp.), and an RT-PCR\nwithout reverse transcriptase was used to exclude genomic\ncontamination (Figure 4(a)). The qRT-PCR analysis con-\nfirmed these results and demonstrated that the expression\n\nof the tvactn3 gene is greatly reduced in the absence of\niron in comparison to tvactn2 and tvactn1 expression, and\ntvactn4 and tvactn5 were not amplified under any of the\ntested iron concentrations and used experimental conditions.\nThe differences observed among the tvactn1, tvactn2, and\ntvactn3 amplicons were significant (\ud835\udc43 < 0.0001), with the\nexception of tvactn1 (\ud835\udc43 < 0.005), and were dependent on the\niron concentration (Figure 4(b)).\n\n3.6. Cloning and Expression of TvACTN3 and Its Three\nDomains. To demonstrate that the 135-kDa actinin\n(TvACTN3) is one of the RNA-binding proteins that\ninteracts with the human IRE-fer and the atypical IRE-tvcp4\nof T. vaginalis, we first performed an in silico analysis of the\nreported tvactn3 gene sequence in the T. vaginalis genome\n(TrichDB Accession no. TVAG 239310). This gene contains\na 3390-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a complete\nTvACTN3 protein of 1129 aa residues with a theoretical\nsize \u223c124.2-kDa and pI of 4.9. It has a short 5\udba0\udc20-UTR with\ntwo putative Inr sequences 3-bp and 10-bp upstream of the\nATG initiation codon. The 3\udba0\udc20-UTR is 11 bp long and has the\ntypical regulatory regions for polyadenylation [30, 31]. The\nTvACTN3 protein contains three domains: Domain I (DI),\nwhich includes two calponin or actin-binding domains (CH)\nat the N-terminus; Domain II (DII), which is followed by\nfour spectrin repeats (SR) in the central rod domain; and\nDomain III (DIII), which includes three EF-hands (EF-H) at\nthe C-terminus (Figure 5(a)).\n\nWe cloned, expressed, and purified the complete tvactn3\ngene sequence and its three domains to obtain recombinant\n\n\n\n10 BioMed Research International\n\nRT-PCR PCR\n0 20 250 (\u2212)(+)\n\nRT-PCR (\u2212)\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n139\n\n128\n\n161\n\n111\n\n115\n\n112\n\n1178\n\n270\n\n[Fe2+] (\ud835\udf07M) (bp)\n\ntvactn1\n\ntvactn2\n\ntvactn3\n\ntvactn4\n\ntvactn5\n\n\ud835\udefd-tubulin\n\ntvpfo a\n\ntvcp12\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n250\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n[Fe2+] (\ud835\udf07M)\n\ntvactn1 tvactn2 tvactn3 tvactn4 tvactn5\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\ntv\nac\n\ntn\nre\n\nlat\niv\n\ne m\nRN\n\nA\n le\n\nve\nls \n\n(%\n)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Effects of iron on the transcription of T. vaginalis actinin genes.

The amplicons were obtained by PCR\nusing T. vaginalis genomic DNA or plasmid DNA-TvACTN3\nand specific primers for each gene fragment (Table 1). These\nsegments were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in a bacte-\nrial system after the induction with IPTG (Figures 5 and 6).\n\nThe complete TvACTN3 protein was expressed as a\nrecombinant \u223c135-kDa protein (TvACTN3r) and purified by\nNi-affinity chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies against the\npurified protein were produced in rabbits (\ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r)\n(Figure 5(b)). This antibody reacted with a 135-kDa protein\nband in the total protein extract of parasites grown in iron-\ndepleted conditions; PI serum was used as a negative control\n(Figure 5(c)). Following cell fractionation of parasites grown\nin different iron concentrations, this protein was detected in\nthe total extracts and cytoplasmic fractions as expected. The\namount of protein was not affected by the iron concentration\n(Figure 5(d)) compared to the control proteins (PFOA for the\nmembrane and HSP70 for cytoplasmic fractions).\n\nWe also obtained recombinant proteins and polyclonal\nantibodies corresponding to each TvACTN3r domain as fol-\nlows: Actin Binding Domain (DI), Spectrin Repeats Domain\n(DII), and the EF-hand Domain (DIII), which had molecular\nweights of 35, 64, and 53 kDa, respectively (Figure 6). Each of\nthe antibodies recognized the complete TvACTN3r protein\n\nas well as the native TvACTN3 protein in total protein\nextracts, as expected. In addition, the antibodies against each\ndomain only recognized the corresponding recombinant\nprotein, while the anti-TvACTN3r antibody recognized all\nthree domains as expected (Figure 7).\n\n3.7. The Polyclonal TvACTN3r Antibody Supershifted RNA-\nProtein Complex I. To test our hypothesis about the par-\nticipation of TvACTN3 in RNA-protein interactions, we\nperformed a supershift assay using the \ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r anti-\nbody in an REMSA reaction between trichomonad iron-\ndepleted cytoplasmic extracts and the IRE-tvcp4 RNA probe.\nFigure 8(a) shows that the RPC I (lane 2) was supershifted\nby the\ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r antiserum in a concentration-dependent\nmanner, and an additional secondRPC (II) was also observed\n(lanes 3\u20135). Moreover, antibodies against each TvACTN3-\nspecific domain (DIr,DIIr, DIIIr) yielded a similar effect (data\nnot shown). An unrelated negative control antibody at the\nhighest concentration (\ud835\udefc-TvTIM2r) had no effect on RPC\nformation, as expected (lane 6). Similar results were obtained\nby supershift assays when the IRE-fer RNA probe was used\nin the presence of \ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r antibody (data not shown).\nThese results showed the participation of TvACTN3 in the\nribonucleoprotein complex that binds the two IREs.\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 11\n\nE E TvACTN3SR SRSRSR\n1129 aa1\n\nCH CH EF\n\n(a)\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n135\n\nN\nI\n\nI PI \ud835\udefc-\nTv\n\nAC\nTN\n\n3\nr\n\n200\n\n116.5\n\n97.40\n\n66.20\n\n45\n\n(kDa) (kDa)\n\n(b)\n\nTv\n-L\n\nPI\n1 2 3\n\n135\n\n\ud835\udefc\n-T\n\nvA\nCT\n\nN\n3\n\nr\n\n200\n\n116.5\n\n97.40\n\n66.20\n\n45\n\n(kDa) (kDa)\n\n(c)\n\n0\n\n70\n\n20\n\n120\n\n250\n\n135\n\nT M C T M C T M CFraction:\n\nCBB\n\n\ud835\udefc-TvACTN3r\n\n\ud835\udefc-TvPFO Ar\n\n\ud835\udefc-TvHSP70r\n\nPI\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n(kDa)\n\n[Fe2+] (\ud835\udf07M)\n\n7 8 9\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 5: Expression of the native T. vaginalis tvactn3 gene and the cloning and expression of recombinant TvACTN3 (TvACTN3r) and its\ncellular distribution.

Domain II of TvACTN3r Has Putative RNA-Binding\nDomains That May Be Used to Interact with RNA. An in\nsilico analysis of DI and DII sequences using the SMART,\nMotif Scan, and PROSITE programs resulted in the iden-\ntification of different regions of TvACTN3 DII putative\nmotifs that have been reported to be involved in RNA-\nprotein interactions, such as the BRIGHT (292\u2013386 aa)\n\n[32], B5 (344\u2013401 aa) [33], LA (392\u2013448 aa) [34], Pumilio-\nbinding (428\u2013464 aa) [35\u201337], and KH (433\u2013502 aa) [36\u2013\n38] domains (Figure 8(d), Table 3). Based on the sequences\nfound in the T. vaginalis genome and NCBI database,\nnone of these putative RNA-binding motifs were identified\nin the other TvACTN proteins (Figure 3; Supplementary\nFigure S1) or in ACTN from other organisms such as\nAedes aegypti (gi|157115648|), Gallus gallus (gi|211083|), Homo\nsapiens (gi|178058|), Drosophila melanogaster (gi|22831541|),\nNaegleria gruberi (gi|284087152|), Paracoccidioides brazilien-\nsis (gi|226286950|), Wuchereria bancrofti (gi|402588131|), and\nEntamoeba dispar (gi|167384828|) (data not shown).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIron plays an important role in host-parasite interactions by\nstimulating cytoadherence and complement resistance and\nby reducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction in host cells\n[39]. The mechanisms by which iron modulates virulence\ngene expression in trichomonads are poorly understood.\nAt the transcriptional level, gene expression is mediated\nby an iron-responsive promoter [13] and the coordinated\ninteractions of at least three Myb proteins [40\u201342].

Recently,\nthe positive expression of TvCP4 by iron was described at\nthe protein level, and predictions of an atypical IRE stem-\nloop structure located at the 5\udba0\udc20 end of the tvcp4 mRNA\nsuggest that an ancestral form of RNA stem-loop structures\nis involved in a novel iron posttranscriptional regulatory\nmechanismmediated by RNA-protein interactions parallel to\nthe IRE/IRP system [11, 12].\n\nIn this work, we identified and characterized a 135-\nkDa cytoplasmic protein corresponding to \ud835\udefc-actinin, called\nTvACTN3, as one of the protein components involved in\nRNA-protein interactions that could mediate posttranscrip-\ntional regulation by iron in T. vaginalis. Our data suggest\nthat this protein is part of a ribonucleomultiprotein complex\ncapable of interacting with the IRE-tvcp4 and IRE-fer stem-\nloop structures (Figures 2(a), 2(c), and 8; Table 2).\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 15\n\nTable 2: Peptides identified by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of the 135-kDa protein band of T. vaginalis that interacted with RNA IRE-tvcp4\nprobe by UV cross-linking assay (Figure 2(a))a.\n\nPeptide numberb Measured\n\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc67 (av)c\n\nCalculated\n\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc67 (av)d Error\n\ne Positionf Peptide sequences (aa)g\n\n1 1516.59 1516.65 \u22120.06 6\u201318 (R)GLLDDAWEQTQIK(V)\n2 1749.93 1749.91 0.02 32\u201347 (K)GIPFDNVLEEFADGVK(L)\n3 1640.95 1641.02 \u22120.07 48\u201361 (K)LIQLLEIVSKEPMK(G)\n4 1624.73 1624.81 \u22120.08 119\u2013132 (K)FMIEEISVEEATAR(D)\n5 928.98 929.11 \u22120.13 133\u2013140 (R)DALLLWAK(K)\n6 2099.52 2099.28 0.24 171\u2013187 (K)FRPNMLDYDSLDQTQQK(E)\n7 2114.98 2115.28 \u22120.30 171\u2013187 (K)FRPNMLDYDSLDQTQQK(E) + Oxidation (M)\n8 2030.39 2030.24 0.15 220\u2013237 (K)SVVTQVAEFFHFFAGESK(T)\n9 1308.21 1308.39 \u22120.18 254\u2013264 (K)AIEEEALNYEK(Q)\n10 1369.87 1369.63 0.24 294\u2013304 (K)SKLFNCIKFGR(V)\n11 1180.53 1180.44 0.09 305\u2013314 (R)VVRPVIVDKR(G)\n12 1279.12 1279.48 \u22120.36 340\u2013350 (K)EELLPPNLNLK(F)\n13 1392.58 1392.51 0.07 398\u2013409 (K)AINLTGDLYEQR(D)\n14 1934.50 1934.07 0.43 410\u2013427 (R)DALNNYLQQAQEAAGTVK(E)\n15 1599.90 1599.83 0.08 428\u2013440 (K)ELQPQFVELVELR(L)\n16 1847.28 1847.11 0.17 448\u2013464 (R)TVIAVDGEFEQLIATIK(R)\n17 2003.26 2003.30 \u22120.04 448\u2013465 (R)TVIAVDGEFEQLIATIKR(L)\n18 1321.37 1321.44 \u22120.06 482\u2013492 (K)KIEEYNQAAQK(Y)\n19 1214.35 1214.33 0.03 502\u2013512 (K)QDLEAIAGELR(E)\n20 1762.73 1762.98 \u22120.25 530\u2013544 (R)NGVSDIRPMFQELEK(Q)\n21 1779.30 1778.98 0.32 530\u2013544 (R)NGVSDIRPMFQELEK(Q) + Oxidation (M)\n22 3063.49 3063.38 0.12 545\u2013572 (K)QSLHLGIENTPDAVTAMYTACLSQAQDK(I)\n23 2108.58 2108.35 0.24 628\u2013645 (K)ASIQPTLEEPYQYLQSIK(Y)\n24 3199.79 3199.39 0.40 660\u2013687 (R)DSDITFAFLTTLLNQLEEQLQSESNDAR(I)\n25 1363.80 1363.47 0.33 698\u2013708 (K)YVDIANEFHQK(V)\n26 1732.90 1732.94 \u22120.04 720\u2013734 (R)RNAYLSAQLELGNKR(E)\n27 1576.51 1576.75 \u22120.24 721\u2013734 (R)NAYLSAQLELGNKR(E)\n28 3097.45 3097.48 \u22120.03 750\u2013777 (R)DTLHIRVNDSPATISKVYANALQIITDK(L)\n29 1656.07 1655.93 0.14 802\u2013816 (K)VVQNVELTGTLLELK(D)\n30 3332.99 3332.65 0.34 824\u2013851 (K)AQAQEILPELPTLDAPWEDLCDFNLNYR(V)\n31 1549.64 1549.68 \u22120.04 992\u20131004 (K)GLQISEEQLTEFR(E)\n32 2601.90 2601.78 0.12 1005\u20131024 (R)ETFNHFDKDHTNFLQYFELR(A)\n33 1027.15 1027.13 0.03 1054\u20131061 (K)LNFDEYVK(F)\n34 1024.19 1024.19 0.00 1062\u20131069 (K)FMLDHFSK(A)\n35 3225.53 3225.52 0.01 1082\u20131109 (K)AIANNNPILTDAQLDQYFKGEEAEYLRK(V)\naMasses listed represent 43% sequence coverage with 2.64\ud835\udc52+ 11MS-Fit MOWSE score and 212 Mascot score and 5.8\ud835\udc52\u2212 15 expect value. bConsecutive number\nassigned to the identified peptides. cMeasured peptidemass average [\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc67 (av)] obtained byMALDI-TOF-MS after tryptic digestion of the 135-kDa protein band\nexcised from a duplicate CBB-stained gel used as a control for the UV cross-linking assays (Figure 2(a)).This protein was identified as actinin3 from T. vaginalis\n(tvactn3, TVAG239310). dCalculated peptide mass average [\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc67 (av)] obtained from a theoretical tryptic digestion of the deduced amino acid sequence of the\nT. vaginalis tvactn3 gene (TVAG 239310; tvactn3) reported in the genome of T. vaginalis [29]. eError represents the difference after comparing the measured\nand calculated peptide mass averages [\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc67 (av)]. ePosition in amino acid residues of the identified peptides (start-end) in the deduced amino acid sequence of\nT. vaginalis tvactn3 gene, tvactn3. gAmino acid sequence of the peptides obtained from a theoretical tryptic digestion of tvactn3 (see Figure S1).\n\nWe demonstrated a specific interaction between cyto-\nplasmic proteins in T. vaginalis grown under iron-depleted\nconditions and IRE structures from this parasite as well\nas human ferritin by REMSA assays (Figure 1).

Herein,\nwe showed the presence of four cytoplasmic RBPs that\nspecifically bind to IRE-fer and IRE-tvcp4 with molecular\nweights ranging from 135-kDa to 45-kDa in iron-depleted\ntrichomonad cytoplasmic extracts (Figure 2(a)).This specific\nlocalization suggests that these proteins could be work-\ning as RBPs. However, the difference in molecular weight\nrelative to IRP-1 or IRP-2, as well as the negative effect\nof \ud835\udefd-mercaptoethanol on RNA-protein complex formation,\nsuggests the presence of atypical RBPs in this particular\nmechanism. Similar results have been reported in other\nprotist parasites [43\u201347].\n\nWhy is actinin 3 one of the RNA-binding proteins in this\nparasite? According to the genome sequence of T. vaginalis,\nthis parasite has five different \ud835\udefc-actinin-encoding genes [29].\nSequence multiple alignments at the nucleotide and protein\nlevels revealed that theN- andC-terminal domains (Domains\nI and III) are conserved among the five trichomonad \ud835\udefc-\nactinins.The central region (Domain II) is themost divergent\ndue to differences in the number of spectrin repeats in each\nisoform (Figure 3). However, only one \ud835\udefc-actinin has been\nstudied previously.The 110-kDa\ud835\udefc-actinin (dubbedTvACTN2\nin here) was found throughout the cytoplasm of pear-shape\nT. vaginalis. In the amoeboid form, high levels of \ud835\udefc-actinin\nwere found in the periphery of this cell, mainly in the\npseudopodia and adhesion plaques that colocalized with the\nactin protein [48]. In addition, overexpression of tvactn2 gene\nhas been reported for parasites adhered to vaginal epithelial\ncells and under low iron conditions [49]. Moreover, in the\nTrichDB database tvactn2 showed the highest number of\nESTs obtained from parasites grown under different environ-\nmental conditions as compared to the other four tvactn genes.\nHowever, the tvactn2 gene showed the lowest number of ESTs\nunder low iron conditions. Our results are consistent with\nthose observed in the TrichDB ESTs (Figure 4), showing less\nexpression of tvactn genes in parasites grown under iron-\ndepleted than under regular or unsynchronized cultures as\nwell as regarding the absence or very poor expression of\ntvactn4 and tvactn5 genes under different growth conditions.\n\nThe participation of TvACTN3 in the RNA-protein com-\nplex formation was evaluated by different functional assays\nutilizing tools we generated, namely, recombinant proteins\n(TvACTN3r and its three domains) and specific antibodies\nagainst each of the recombinant proteins (Figures 5\u20137).\nSupershift, NWB, and UV cross-linking assays revealed that\nthe TvACTN3r protein possible through the DIIr domain can\nbind RNA hairpin structures (Figure 8).These results suggest\nthe role of TvACTN3 as an RNA-binding protein.\n\nThe typical role of \ud835\udefc-actinin is to serve as a ubiqui-\ntous cytoskeletal conserved protein in eukaryotic cells that\ncross-links actin filaments and plays an important role in\nmotion and morphological changes [50]. \ud835\udefc-Actinin belongs\nto the spectrin superfamily, which is characterized by the\nability to bind actin and by the presence of several spectrin\nrepeats [51]. Its other important roles in the cell are link-\ning the cytoskeleton to different transmembrane proteins,\nregulating the activity of several receptors and serving as\na scaffold to connect the cytoskeleton to diverse signaling\npathways. Over the course of evolution, alternative splicing\n\nand gene duplication have led to a substantial functional\nassortment within the \ud835\udefc-actinin protein family.This diversity\nis most marked in mammalian cells, in which four \ud835\udefc-actinin-\nencoding genes produce at least six different products or\nisoforms. Each isoform has different tissue and subcellular\nlocalizations, expression profiles, and biochemical charac-\nteristics [52]. Similar relationships are likely to be expected\nfor the five actinin-encoding genes of T. vaginalis, which\nappear to have specific expression levels under different\niron concentrations (Figure 4). These results are consistent\nwith recently reported RT-PCR, microarray, and EST data\n(http://www.trichdb.org/) [49, 53].\n\nMoreover, the T. vaginalis genome has undergone mul-\ntiple gene duplication events; the presence of five \ud835\udefc-actinin\ncoding genes likely represents a neofunctionalization process.\nAlthough actinin primarily function as an actin-binding\nprotein, gene duplication throughout evolution led to the\nacquisition of new roles inside the cell, including RNA-\nbinding, depending on the microenvironmental conditions.\nThis is not surprising because cytoskeletal proteins are also\ninvolved in RNA-cytoskeletal associations and mRNA local-\nization in most of cell types. The association of RNAs with\ncytoskeletal proteins is required in cellular processes such\nas mRNA transport and protein synthesis [54]. Cytoskeletal\nproteins such as\ud835\udefd-actin and annexinA2 also contribute to the\nposttranscriptional regulation of gene expression of specific\ngenes through interactions between these proteins and cis-\nacting elements, generating a higher-order structure and\nregulating the localization and translation of these specific\ntranscripts [55\u201357].\n\nBecause RNA-protein interactions were identified only\nunder iron-depleted concentrations, we analyzed the expres-\nsion of the tvactn3 gene. We observed that this gene is\nupregulated by iron at the mRNA level (Figure 4); however,\nprotein expression appears to be constitutive (Figure 5(d)).\nThe interaction of actinin TvACTN3 with RNA could occur\nin the absence of iron through some of the putative RNA-\nbinding motifs found in the central DII domain, particularly\nin the region between residues 230 and 662, as suggested\nby in silico analysis (Figure 8; Table 3). These data suggest\nthat iron may control the interaction of TvACTN3 with\nactin or RNA possible by causing conformational changes by\nswitching functions depending on the iron concentration but\nwithout modifying the amount of protein. However, we can\nspeculate that (a) under iron-rich concentrations TvACTN3\nis an actin-binding protein that promotes polymerization and\nstabilizes actin filaments and that (b) under iron-depleted\nconcentrations TvACTN3 is an RNA-binding protein that\ninteracts with RNA hairpin structures that may be involved\nin a parallel posttranscriptional iron regulation mechanism.\nWork is in progress to analyze these possibilities.\n\nThe RNA-TvACTN3 interaction seem to be absent in\nthe other four T. vaginalis \ud835\udefc-actinins and in \ud835\udefc-actinins\nfrom other species when using different computational pro-\ngrams. Thus to identify the putative RNA-binding domain\nin the TvACTN3 central domain DII, additional studies are\nneeded to define the particular region(s) of DII responsible\nfor the RNA-protein interaction, which could include the\nputative motifs identified previously (Table 3) or a new\n\n\n\n18 BioMed Research International\n\nuncharacterizedmotif that might be responsible for the novel\nRNA-binding property identified in the TvACTN3 of this\nearly evolving protist parasite. It will also be necessary to\ndetermine whether TvACTN3 also interacts with other IRE-\nlike structures present in the multiple iron-regulated genes,\nas recently described [49, 50], in addition to the structure\nidentified in the 3\udba0\udc20-UTR region of the iron-downregulated\ntvcp12 gene, which encodes another CP of T. vaginalis\nand plays a role in cytotoxicity (unpublished results). Thus,\nthis finding could represent a novel posttranscriptional iron\nregulatory mechanism common to iron-regulated genes in T.\nvaginalis.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, our results showed that TvACTN3 is one of the\ncytoplasmic proteins acting as an RNA-binding protein that\ncould participate in iron regulation at the posttranscriptional\nlevel by a mechanism mediated by RNA-protein interactions\nparallel to the IRE/IRP system.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by CINVESTAV and by\nGrants 162123 and 153093 (to Rossana Arroyo) from Consejo\nNacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u0131\u0301a (CONACYT), Me\u0301xico, and\nGrants ICYT-299 and ICYT-186 from Instituto de Ciencia\ny Tecnolog\u0131\u0301a del Distrito Federal (ICyTDF), Me\u0301xico, (to\nRossana Arroyo).

MTT assays indicated no significant difference between the amount of cells with (LS+) and without (LS\u2212) laser\ntreatment (\ud835\udc43 > 0.05). However, immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis results indicated a significant increase in the\nneural stem-cell marker, nestin, following exposure to low-level laser irradiation (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05). Furthermore, stem cell implantation\nwas applied to treat rats suffering from stroke. At 28 days posttreatment, the motor functions of the rats treated using i-ADSCs\n(LS+) did not differ greatly from those in the sham group and HE-stained brain tissue samples exhibited near-complete recovery\nwith nearly no brain tissue damage. However, the motor functions of the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) remained somewhat\ndysfunctional and tissue displayed necrotic scarring and voids. The western blot analysis also revealed significant expression of\noligo-2 in the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS+) as well as in the sham group (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05). The results demonstrated that low-level\nlaser irradiation exerts a positive effect on the differentiation of i-ADSCs and can be employed to treat rats suffering from ischemic\nstroke to regain motor functions.\n\n1. Introduction\nStroke has become a common disease and has been shown to\nbe associated with the consumption of high amounts of oil\nand salt. These dietary habits cause blood vessels to narrow\nand become prone to occlusion, which can lead to stroke.\nStrokes can be broadly classified into 2 categories: ischemic\nand hemorrhagic strokes. Differing treatment methods are\nused according to stroke type and lesion location. Therefore,\nat stroke onset, computed tomography ormagnetic resonance\nimaging is often used for diagnosis to provide physicians with\na basis of treatment [1]. The treatment methods used for the\n2 types of stroke are different. (1) Ischemic stroke is caused\nby thrombosis or blood clots in the brain vessels, which\n\nprevent blood flow into the brain tissues. Anticoagulants or\nantiplatelet medications must be administered to patients\nas soon as possible. (2) Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by\nthe rupture or hemorrhaging of brain vessels caused by\nperipheral brain trauma (subarachnoid hemorrhage). The\nmajority of cases of hemorrhagic stroke are caused by\nbrain trauma (e.g., car and workplace accidents). Treating\nthese patients often requires neurosurgical interventions [2].\nIschemic strokes constitute the majority of stroke cases.\nWhen patients suffer from ischemic stroke, the brain tissues\nnecrotize gradually because of the lack of nutrients if anti-\ncoagulants or antiplatelet medications are not administered\nwithin 3 h of the stroke. After necrosis occurs, necrotic brain\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\ntissue cannot regenerate or recover its functions even if\nblood-vessel reperfusion occurs [3]. In recent years, stem cell\ntreatment has become an innovative therapy for brain tissues\nthat cannot regenerate.\n\nBody fat extraction (e.g., abdomen, thigh, or buttock fat)\nhas been used for body shaping procedures in the past, and\nthe extracted fat was discarded as medical waste. Presently,\nmedical experts have confirmed that adipose tissues contain\nlarge amounts of mesenchymal stem cells that exhibit in vitro\nproliferation and multiple differentiation ability, character-\nistics that facilitate the repair and regeneration of damaged\ntissues or organs [4]. In addition, adipose-derived stem cells\n(ADSCs) possess several characteristics: (1) they can be easily\nharvested in abundant quantities without invasiveness, (2)\nthey can proliferate in in vitro cultures, and (3) they can be\napplied to awide range of body tissue types because these cells\nmigrate to lesion sites automatically to repair damage. Studies\nhave shown that ADSCs can differentiate into many different\ncell types, such as adipose, bone, cartilage, smooth muscle,\ncardiac muscle, endothelial, blood, liver, and even neuronal\ncells [5]. Because of these characteristics, ADSCs will likely\nbe one of the major sources of autologous stem cells in the\nfuture.\n\nThe effectiveness of laser therapy on biological bodies\nhas been confirmed, and laser therapy has been successfully\napplied in new technological applications such as micro-\nsurgery. Lasers can be classified as high or lowpower, depend-\ning on the energy levels used.High-power lasers involve using\nhigh energy levels to provoke blood coagulation, stop bleed-\ning, cut tissues, and even damage cells, whereas low-level\nlasers involve using electromagnetic or photochemical pro-\ncesses to achieve therapeutic effects [6]. A low-level laser is\ndefined as a laser with extremely low power and energy too\nlow to destroy themolecular bonding capacity (e.g., hydrogen\nbonds and van der Waals forces) of tissues. Therefore,\nlow-level lasers do not cause molecular structural change,\nprotein denaturation, or cell death. Irradiation from low-level\nlasers on tissue does not cause an obvious temperature inc-\nrease at the treatment site (less than 0.1 to 0.5\u2218C); thus, any\nphysiological responses of the tissues are produced by the\nstimulation of the laser itself, and this mechanism is des-\ncribed by the theory of laser biostimulation [7]. In addition,\nby using an appropriate energy level, low-level lasers are pri-\nmarily used to stimulate biological cells to induce or\nstrengthen physiological responses for facilitating local blood\ncirculation, regulating cell functions, promoting immunolog-\nical functions, and facilitating cell metabolism and prolifer-\nation. Using lasers to generate these physiological changes\nenables treatment goals such as anti-inflammation and\nwound-healing promotion to be met [8, 9]. Many studies\nhave shown that low-level laser irradiation exerts beneficial\nbiological effects on bone, neuronal, and skin healing [10\u2013\n12]. However, the type, wavelength, power, and energy level\nof lasers used in previous studies have varied, and various\neffects have been observed in different cells when differing\nlevels of laser energy were applied. Previous studies have\nshown that using a low-level laser with an 820\u2013830 nmwave-\nlength can reduce neural damage, facilitate neuronal healing,\nand accelerate neural recovery after an osteotomy [13, 14].\n\nUsing a low-level laser with a 660 nm wavelength has been\ndemonstrated to exert healing effects on musculoskeletal\ninjuries and inflammation [15]. In addition, many studies\nhave indicated that a low-level laser with a 660 nm wave-\nlength can effectively promote neural regeneration and accel-\nerate the reinnervation of muscle fibers to promote the reco-\nvery of motor functions [16\u201318]. Recent evidence has sug-\ngested that protein aggregates such as \ud835\udefd-amyloid- (A\ud835\udefd) asso-\nciated neurotoxicity and dendrite atrophy might be a con-\nsequence of brain-derived neurotrophic-factor (BDNF) defi-\nciency. Meng et al. observed that the upregulation of BDNF\ncaused by using low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to activate the\nextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cAMP response\nelement-binding protein (CREB) pathway can ameliorate\nA\ud835\udefd-induced neuron loss and dendritic atrophy, thus identi-\nfying a novel pathway through which LLLT protects against\nA\ud835\udefd-induced neurotoxicity [19].\n\nCurrently, most low-level laser therapies in practical\nclinical applications emphasize treatment courses covering\nan extensive tissue area in a relatively short period. Multi-\nchannel-laser hair treatment, which is currently available\nfor the physical treatment of alopecia, is one such example.\nTherefore, we used a large-area LLLT that differs from the\nirradiation methods previously reported in the literature\n(such as single-spot low-energy laser exposure or the scan-\nning method) to increase the local area of exposure [18]. In\nthis study, stem cells were extracted from adipose tissues, and\nneural-stem-cell- (NSC-) differentiating agents were used\nto culture these ADSCs to transform them into induced\nadipose-derived stem cells (i-ADSCs), which were used as\nexperimental cells. First, we investigated the effects of large-\narea irradiation from a low-level laser on the proliferation\nand differentiation of i-ADSCs into neuronal cells. We then\ninvestigated whether i-ADSCs treated with laser irradiation\nand injected via an intravenous route could integrate and\nsurvive in various locations in rat brains. We investigated if\nthis treatment could improve the neurological dysfunctions\ncaused by ischemic brain damage in rats and if rats could\nproduce BDNF, using this treatment. Studies using intra-\nvenous injection to transplant i-ADSC for the treatment of\nischemic stroke with protocols similar to that used in the\ncurrent study are rare. In this study, we further combined\nthe biostimulation theory from large-area LLLT with trans-\nplantation of i-ADSCs to induce neural differentiation to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of ischemic stroke treatment. In\na previous study [20], we established a transient ischemia-\nreperfusion stroke rodent model by using right-sided middle\ncerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to simulate acute clinical\ninsults. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed by\ncomparing HE-staining and western blot analysis, as well as\nthe evaluation of motor skill indices by using the rotarod\nand grip-strength tests. Our protocol has the potential to be\ndeveloped for application in the clinical treatment of patients\nwith ischemic stroke.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Isolation and Culture of ADSCs. A flowchart illustrating\nthe experimental design of the study is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nu-ADSCs\n\nInduced by NSCs \n\nMedia supplementation\n\nMCAO model\n\nLaser irradiation Cell transplantation\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\ni-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\n\ni-ADSCs (LS\ni-ADSCs\n\n+)\n\nFigure 1: A flowchart illustrating the experimental design. Detailed\nprocedures are described in Section 2.\n\nEight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used\nfor isolating rat ADSCs. The ADSCs were harvested from\nthe rats\u2019 subcutaneous anterior abdominal wall. Inguinal fat\npads were excised, washed sequentially in serial dilutions\nof betadine, and finely minced as tissues in phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS). The tissues were digested with 0.3% of\nType I collagenase (Sigma) at 37\u2218C for 60min. The digested\ntissue/cell suspension was filtered through a 100-mesh filter\nto remove the debris, and the filtrate was centrifuged at\n1000 rpm for 10min. The cellular pellet was resuspended\nusing DMEM/F12 (10% FBS, 1% P/S) and then cultured for\n24 h at 37\u2218C in 5% CO\n\n2\n. Unattached cells and debris were\n\nthen removed and the adherent cellswere cultured using fresh\nmedium. The cells were cultured to 80% confluency before\nbeing released with 0.05% trypsin and then subcultured.\n\n2.2. ADSC Neuronal Predifferentiation. In this study, i-\nADSCs obtained from culturing ADSCs by adding NSC-dif-\nferentiating agents were used as experimental cells. ADSCs\nwithin 3\u20135 passages were detached and induced using NSC\nmedia supplementation. ADSCs were resuspended in a\nserum-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with an N2\nsupplement (Sigma), 20 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor\n(Gibco, NY, USA), and fibroblast growth factor (Gibco, NY,\nUSA).\n\n2.3. Setup of a Low-Level Laser Application Method. The\nprobe of the laser irradiation device was fixed vertically on\na clean, open experimental bench. The distance between the\nprobe and the cell culture dish was 30 cm. Laser irradiation\nwas applied in a 25\u2218C environment by using an AlGaInP-\ndiode laser (Konftec Co., Taipei, Taiwan) with a wavelength\nof 660 nm at an output power of 50mW and frequency of\n50Hz. In the control group, the cells that did not receive\nlaser irradiation treatment, i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) (\ud835\udc5b = 10), were\ncompared with the experimental cells, i-ADSCs (LS+) (\ud835\udc5b =\n10), which were subjected to a laser irradiation treatment of\n10min. The cells in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group were cultured\nfor 7 days, whereas the cells in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nwere treated using low-level lasers on the following day for\n10min and then cultured for 6 days. The cells receiving\nlaser irradiation were collected at various times for analysis\naccording to the purposes of the experimental protocols.\nAfter the completion of the cultures, an optical microscope\nwas used for observing cell morphology.\n\n2.4. MTT Assay. The principle of the MTT (3-[4,5-dime-\nthylthiazol-2-y1]-2,4-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay is\n\nthat the mitochondria of living cells can transform the yellow\nchemical substance MTT tetrazolium into the purple non-\nwater-soluble substance MTT formazan through the effect of\nsuccinate dehydrogenase. DMSO can be used to dissolve the\npurple-colored products. No such response occurs in dead\ncells. An optical absorbance of 570 nm was measured using\nan enzyme immunoassay analyzer. Ahigher absorbance value\nindicates a larger amount of cells. In this study, ADSCs\nneuronal predifferentiation was first distributed in a 96-\nwell plate with approximately 10000 cells per well. The cells\nin the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group were then cultured in a 37\u2218C\nenvironment and a 5% CO\n\n2\nenvironment for 5 days and 7\n\ndays, respectively. The cells in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group were\ncultured in a 37\u2218C environment and a 5% CO\n\n2\nenvironment\n\nfor 4 days and 6 days, respectively. After the completion of\nthe cultures, the medium was removed by several rinses with\nPBS. An MTT solution of 100 \ud835\udf07L was added to each well\nof a 96-well plate in the dark (1mL of MTT reagent was\nadded to 9mL of phenol-red-free, serum-free medium) and\nincubated in a 37\u2218C, 5% CO\n\n2\nenvironment for 2 h. The MTT\n\nsolution was then removed and the cells were dissolved using\nDMSO.An optical absorbance of 570 nmwasmeasured using\nan enzyme immunoassay analyzer to compare the values\nbetween the different groups.\n\n2.5. Immunocytochemistry of i-ADSCs. After 7 days in cul-\nture, the subcultured neurospheres were washed using 0.1M\nPBS 3 times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h.\nFollowing the fixation, the cells were permeated with 0.1%\nof Triton X-100 for 10min and then blocked with 5% nonfat\nmilk for 30min. The phenotypic expression of these neuro-\nspheres was examined by implementing immunocytochemi-\ncal staining accompanied by antibodies against glial fibrillary\nacidic proteins (GFAPs) for astrocytes, mouse monoclonal\nantinestins for NSCs, and doublecortin (DCX), which has\nrecently been used as a marker for neurogenesis. Briefly, the\nfixed cells were washed 3 times in cold PBS. After wash-\ning with PBS, the aforementioned primary antibodies were\nadded and the slides were maintained at room temperature\novernight. In the following day, the primary antibodies were\nremoved by washing 3 times with PBS and the secondary\nantibodies were added before incubating the cells for 1 h.\nAfter washing off the secondary antibodies, the cells were\nincubated with tertiary antibodies tagged with peroxidase-\nantiperoxidase for 1 h. The tertiary antibodies were washed\noff using PBS. The cells were incubated with DAPI (Sigma,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA) diluted with the cell culture medium\nfor 10min. Finally, the cells were mounted with 90% glycerol\nand examined using fluorescentmicroscopy (Olympus IX-71,\nInc., Trenton, NJ, USA).\n\n2.6. Animals and Induction of theMCAOModel. In a previous\nstudy [20], we established a transient ischemia-reperfusion\nstroke rodentmodel, using right-sidedmiddle cerebral artery\nocclusion (MCAO) to simulate acute clinical insults. All of\nthe experimental procedures were approved by the Institu-\ntional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taichung Veteran\nGeneral Hospital, Taiwan. Thirty-two adult male SD rats\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nwere randomly allocated to 3 groups: the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\ntherapy group (\ud835\udc5b = 12), the i-ADSCs (LS+) therapy group\n(\ud835\udc5b = 12), and a sham group (\ud835\udc5b = 8). The rats in all 3\ngroups were euthanized on the 28th day after MCAO was\nperformed. For MCAO procedures, anesthesia was induced\nusing 4% isoflurane (Baxter, USA) and maintained using 2%\nisoflurane. A midline cervical incision was made to isolate\nthe right bilateral common carotid artery. A 25mm-long\n3-0 nylon surgical thread was then inserted into the right\ncarotid bifurcation. In this study, 2 rounds were used to\nprovide a more complete blockage of blood flow in the artery.\nWhen the blunted distal end met resistance, the proximal\nend of the thread was tightened at the carotid bifurcation.\nThe right common, internal, and external carotid arteries\nwere carefully separated from the adjacent vagal nerve, and\nthe distal portions of the external and common carotid\narteries were ligated. A small incision was subsequently\nmade at the proximal portion of the external carotid artery,\nand a 3-0 nylon monofilament suture was gently inserted\n(approximately 18mm) into the internal carotid artery. After\n60min of MCAO, the nylon surgical thread was removed\nto allow complete reperfusion of the ischemic area. During\nischemia, rectal temperature was monitored and maintained\nat approximately 37\u2218Cby using a heating pad and an overhead\nlamp. The anesthetized rats intravenously received i-ADSCs\nat a concentration of 2 \u00d7 107mL\u22121 via their femoral veins.\nThe rats in the sham group underwent the same surgical\nprocedures except that the right-sided middle cerebral artery\nwas not occluded.\n\n2.7. Rotarod Test. An accelerating rotarod test was performed\nfor each rat before and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th\nday after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was induced. Before\nthe ischemia-reperfusion experiment was conducted, the\nanimals were subjected to 3 training sessions per day for 3\ndays on the accelerating rotarod to obtain stable duration\non the rotarod spindle. The diameter of the rotarod spindle\nwas 7 cm. The surface of the rotarod spindle was made\nof knurled Perspex to provide an adequate grip, which\nprevented animals from slipping off the spindle. The speed\nof the spindle was increased from 4 to 40 rpm over a period\nof 5min and the duration that the animal stayed on the\ndevice was recorded. The rats that were capable of staying on\nthe rotarod longer than 150 s after 3 training sessions were\nselected for the experiments. On the testing days, the animals\nwere tested twice, and the longest durations on the rotarod\nwere recorded.\n\n2.8. Grip Strength Test. Each rat was supported in a horizon-\ntal position approximately parallel to a grip bar (Model DPS-\n5R: range 0\u20135 kgf, Japan).The researcher set the rat\u2019s forepaws\non the grip bar and pulled the animal horizontally away from\nthe bar by the base of its tail until the rat released its grip.The\npulling motion was smooth and continuous. The researcher\nsupported the rat by the abdomenwhen the gripwas released.\nThe reading on the strain gauge remained constant at the\npoint of maximal value, which was recorded as the measure\nof forepaw grip strength. The researcher supported the rat\n\nbody by both the chest and the base of the tail at an angle\nof \u221245\u2218 down the tail. The rat was facing away from the grip\nbar. The rat was encouraged to grasp the bar by moving its\nhind paw to the bar. When the rat grasped the bar with both\nhind paws, establishing a \u201cfull\u201d grip, the upper body of the rat\nwas lowered so that the rat was in a nearly horizontal position.\nThe rat was pulled horizontally by the base of the tail until it\nreleased its grip and was supported as previously described.\nThe reading on the strain gauge remained constant at the\npoint ofmaximal value (force wasmeasured in grams), which\nwas recorded as the measurement of forepaw grip strength.\nThree values were obtained in succession, and the median\nvalue was used as the daily score. The data were expressed as\nthe percentage of the baseline (preischemic) value.\n\n2.9. Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining of the Cerebellum. The SD\nrats were anesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate (4\ud835\udf07L/kg),\nadministered intraperitoneally, and were euthanized on the\n28th day after the MCAO operation and sham treatment.\nFor each rat, the left cerebellum was rapidly removed and\npostfixed in formalin for 24 h. The postfixed tissues were\nembedded in paraffin wax and 6-\ud835\udf07m-thick serial coronal\nsections were obtained andmounted on poly-L-lysine-coated\nglass slices. To assess the histological changes in the MCAO\nand sham groups, the paraffin-embedded left cerebellum sec-\ntions were stained using hematoxylin-eosin (HE), according\nto standard protocol before the assay was performed.\n\n2.10. Western Blot Analysis. Proteins were extracted from\nthe rat brains by using a cold lysis buffer (10mM of tetra\nsodium pyrophosphate, 20mM of Hepes, 1% Triton X-\n100, 100mM NaCl, 2 \ud835\udf07g/mL of aprotinin, 2 \ud835\udf07g/mL of leu-\npeptin, and 100 \ud835\udf07g/mL of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).\nThe protein concentrations from tissue extracts or ADSC-\nconditioned medium were determined using the Bradford\nprotein assay. Equal amounts of protein were placed in a\n2\u00d7 sample buffer (0.125M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% glycerol,\n0.2mg/mL of bromophenol blue dye, 2% SDS, and 10% \ud835\udefd-\nmercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed through 10% SDS-\npolyacrylamide gel.The proteins were then transferred onto a\nnitrocellulose membrane by using electroblotting.The mem-\nbranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in a Tris-\nbuffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk.\nThe primary antibodies (1 : 1000) with appropriate dilutions\nwere incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST and 5%\nnonfat milk. The blots were then washed and incubated with\na peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 2000) for 1 h\nin TBST. The chemiluminescent substrate for the secondary\nantibody was developed using the ECL detection system\n(Amersham, UK).The blots were exposed to film for 3\u20135min\nand then developed.\n\n2.11. Statistical Analysis. Thedata were expressed as themean\nvalue\u00b1 standard error of themean.The statistical significance\nof the differences between the groups was determined using\na one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s test. An\nalpha level of less than 0.05 (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05) was considered sta-\ntistically significant.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 2: The morphology of inductions of adipose-derived stem cell (i-ADSC) differentiation into neuronal cells after low-level laser\nirradiation.

Effects of the Low-Level Laser on Cell Morphology. The\nADSCs were passaged 3\u20135 times after the initial plating of\nthe primary culture. Rat ADSCs appeared to be a monolayer\nof large and flat cells (Figure 2(a)). Many cells in the i-\nADSCs (LS\u2212) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups induced a neuronal\nphenotype and exhibited, among one another, bipolar and\nmultipolar elongations of neuronally induced cell-forming\nnetworks. The results show that the stem cells in both i-\nADSCs (LS\u2212) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups developed tentacles,\nindicating that ADSCs were facilitating the induction of dif-\nferentiation into neuronal cells. Comparative optical micro-\ngraphs revealed that some attached cells exhibited a spread-\nout shape with a spindle-like and fibroblastic phenotype in\nthe i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group (Figure 2(b)). However, most of\ni-ADSCs-expressing neurites extended radially, connecting\nlike bridges with those from adjacent cells in the i-ADSCs\n(LS+) group (Figure 2(c)).\n\n3.2. Effects of the Low-Level Laser on Cell Proliferation and\nDifferentiation. In this study,MTT assays were performed on\nDay 5 and Day 7 to evaluate the effects of large-area low-level\nlaser irradiation on the facilitation of cell proliferation. After\nanalyzing the optical absorbance values, the results showed\nthat, on Day 5, cell activity was slightly higher in the i-ADSCs\n(LS+) group compared with that in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group.\nHowever, the difference was not statistically significant (\ud835\udc43 >\n0.05). On Day 7, the cell amounts in both the i-ADSCs (LS+)\nand i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) groups were larger than the amounts on\nDay 5. However, the cell proliferation rates were similar on\nDay 5 without major differences (\ud835\udc43 > 0.05) (Figure 3).\n\nIn this study, immunofluorescent staining and western\nblots were used to evaluate the effects of large-area low-\nlevel laser irradiation on the facilitation of cell differentiation.\nImmunofluorescent staining was performed for the NSC\nmarker, nestin, glial cell marker, GFAP antibody, and neu-\nronal precursor-cell-marker protein, DCX. After the staining\nwas completed, fluorescent microscopy was used to observe\nthe amount of fluorescence expression of each antibody.\nThe results showed that the fluorescence expression of\n\nDay 5 Day 7\n0.00\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n0.20\n\n0.24\n\n0.28\n\nDays\n\nO\npt\n\nic\nal\n\n d\nen\n\nsit\ny \n\n(O\n.D\n\n.)\n\ni-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\ni-ADSCs (LS+)\n\nFigure 3: The cell activity of inductions of adipose-derived stem\ncell (i-ADSC) differentiation into neuronal cells in both the i-ADSCs\n(LS\u2212) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups on Days 5 and 7 after culture.\n\nthe nestin was higher in the cells in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nthan that in the cells in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group. These\nresults indicated that ADSC differentiation into neuronal\ncells was facilitated after large-area low-level laser irradiation\n(Figure 4(a)). For GFAP, no difference was observed in the\namount of fluorescence expression of GFAP between the\ni-ADSCs (LS\u2212) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups (Figure 4(b)).\nFurthermore, for DCX, no difference was observed between\nthe 2 groups because the cells in both groups still exhibited\nstem cell morphology (Figure 4(c)).\n\nWestern blot is used to quantify the expression of mar-\nker proteins. Therefore, western blot analysis was used to\ncompare the amount of nestin expression between the i-\nADSCs (LS\u2212) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups in this study.

Therefore, western\nblot analyses were not shown for GFAP and DCX.This result\nis consistent with the findings obtained using immunofluo-\nrescent staining.\n\n3.3. Evaluation of Behavior Recovery after Stroke in the\nAnimals. In this study, treadmill and forepaw-grip tests\nwere used to evaluate motor function recovery after stem-\ncell transplantation treatment in rats with ischemic stroke.\nThe treadmill test was performed on Day 7 after stem-cell\ntransplantation was performed on the rats with stroke. The\nrats from either the i-ADSCs (LS+) group or the i-ADSCs\n\n(LS\u2212) group were unable to run as quickly as the rats in the\nsham group. From Day 14, the rats in the i-ADSCs (LS+)\ngroup gradually recovered the ability to run. By contrast,\nit was observed that the rats in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group\nrecovered slightly; however, the degree of recovery was lower\nthan that in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group. On Day 21 after stem-\ncell transplantation, the recovery of running functionwas still\nmore satisfactory in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group than in the i-\nADSCs (LS\u2212) group. On Day 28, the motor function of the\nrats in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group was approaching the level\nof the rats in the sham group, whereas the performance of the\nrats in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) groupwas still considerably weaker\nthan that of the sham group (Figure 6).\n\nGrip-strength tests were performed on Day 7 after stem-\ncell transplantation.Thefindingswere similar to the treadmill\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7\n\nLS\u2212 LS+\n\n220\n\n43\n\n34\n\nNestin\n\n(kDa)\n\nGAPDH\n\nLS\u2212: i-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\nLS+: i-ADSCs (LS+)\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nRe\nla\n\ntiv\ne i\n\nnt\nen\n\nsit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\nGroups\ni-ADSCs (LS+)i-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\n\n\u2217\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5: The cell growth of inductions of adipose-derived stem\ncell (i-ADSC) differentiation into neuronal cells with or without\nlaser irradiation.

By contrast, although the rats in the i-\nADSCs (LS\u2212) group showed some progress, the improvement\nwas minimal. On Day 21, the rats in the i-ADSCs (LS+)\ngroup continued to recover, whereas it was observed that the\nanimals in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group were not recovering as\nquickly. On Day 28, grip strength recovery in the i-ADSCs\n(LS+) group approached that of the sham group, whereas\ngrip strength in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group was still lower\n(Figure 7).\n\n3.4. Repair of Brain Tissues after Treatment in Animals. After\neuthanizing the rats, the brain specimens were treated with\nparaffin and then sliced.

By contrast, obvious necrotic scars were\nobserved at the ischemic sites of the brain tissue from the rats\nin the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group (Figure 8(a)). Observed under a\nmicroscope and magnified 200 times, the results showed that\nthe brain tissue from the rats in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group was\nas dense as normal brain tissues, whereas numerous cavities\nwere observed in the brain tissue from rats in the i-ADSCs\n(LS\u2212) group (Figure 8(b)).\n\n\n\n8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8: The observation of brain tissue necrosis in rats with ischemic stroke treated with i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) (left) and i-ADSCs (LS+) (right)\ntransplantation: (a) 10x; (b) 200x.\n\nOligodendrocytes, which are glial cells found in normal\nbrains, formmyelin in the central nervous system. Oligoden-\ndrocytes substantially decrease after brain cells are damaged,\nleading to myelin collapse and the loss of neural-signal con-\nduction. Therefore, a western blot was used to analyze the\namount of expression of the oligodendrocyte cell protein,\noligo-2, to confirm the repair of brain tissues after stem-cell\ntransplantation was performed in rats with stroke.The results\nshowed that the amount of oligo-2 protein response in the\nbrain tissues of the i-ADSCs (LS+) group was as high as that\nin the sham group. By contrast, the oligo-2 protein response\nin the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group was substantially lower (\ud835\udc43 <\n0.05). These results indicated that stem-cell transplantation\ntreatments can repair brain tissues damaged by ischemia\n(Figure 9).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nStem cells possess the ability to proliferate, regenerate, differ-\nentiate, and secrete cytokines. Previous studies have proven\nthat stem-cell therapy substantially improves the damage\ncaused by stroke. Stem cells are derived from various sites.\nMost previous studies have used bone marrow mesenchymal\nstem cells; however, we used adipose stem cells in the present\nstudy, which are easily accessible, and abundant and exhibit\nhigh differentiation and proliferation activity. Moreover,\nadipose stem cells do not trigger strong immune reactions\n(resulting in low exclusion) and rarely form teratomas. In\n\nthe literature, it has been demonstrated that adipose stemcells\nare essential adult stem cells that differentiate into various\nmesoderm tissues similarly to bone marrow mesenchymal\nstem cells [21\u201323]. Furthermore, adipose stem cells are more\neasily accessible than mesenchymal stem cells; therefore,\nadipose stem cells can be used as a substitute for bonemarrow\nmesenchymal stem cells for repairing damaged tissues in the\nfuture. Adipose stem cells are generally more practical than\nbonemarrowmesenchymal stem cells for use in research [23\u2013\n26].\n\nIn this study, we used large-area low-level laser irradiation\nto induce ADSCs to differentiate into neuronal cells. The\nMTT assay analysis showed that the cell activity of the i-\nADSCs increased on Days 5 and 7 of culture after large-area\nlow-level laser irradiation [27, 28]. However, although cell\nactivity increased on both Days 5 and 7, the activity was also\nincreased for the group that did not receive laser irradiation\ntreatment. No significant difference was observed between\nthe groups with or without laser treatment (\ud835\udc43 > 0.05). Pre-\nvious studies have shown that, depending on irradiation para-\nmeters, various types of cell respond differently to laser irra-\ndiation [29]. Although the mechanism underlying this phe-\nnomenon remains obscure, several hypotheses have been\nproposed to explain the mechanism of laser action [30]. We\nspeculate that the lack of significant effects might be attri-\nbutable to the short duration of low-level laser irradiation,\nwhich might not provide sufficient energy to the ADSCs for\nthem to facilitate proliferation. Alternatively, using low-level\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9\n\n32\n\n43\n\n34\n\nOligo-2\n\nGAPDH\n\nS LS+ LS\u2212\n(kDa)\n\nS: sham group\nLS+: i-ADSCs (LS+)\nLS\u2212: i-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\n\n(a)\n\nSham\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nRe\nla\n\ntiv\ne i\n\nnt\nen\n\nsit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\nGroups\ni-ADSCs (LS\u2212) i-ADSCs (LS+)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 9: The observation of brain tissue repair in rats with\nischemic stroke treated with i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) and i-ADSCs (LS+)\ntransplantation.

GAPDH served as the internal reference. \u2217Significance (\ud835\udc43 <\n0.05) greater than that of the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group.\n\nlasers on the ADSCs might not sufficiently enhance cell pro-\nliferation. Therefore, future studies should investigate the\nappropriate duration of low-level laser irradiation and deter-\nmine how much energy is required to accelerate cell prolifer-\nation [31, 32].\n\nTo understand if using large-area low-level lasers exerted\na positive effect on cell differentiation, we used immunofluo-\nrescent staining andwestern blot analysis to evaluate whether\nthese lasers were capable of accelerating the induction of cell\ndifferentiation [33]. The immunofluorescent staining results\nshowed that the nestin level in the group with i-ADSCs\ntreated using large-area low-level laser irradiation increased\nsubstantially compared with that of the group that did not\nreceive laser treatment. This result indicated that large-area\nlow-level laser can accelerate the differentiation of ADSCs\ninto neuronal cells [34, 35]. LLLT has been demonstrated to\nregulate neuronal function both in vitro and in vivo. Previous\nstudies have reported that laser treatments accelerated nerve\ncell sprouting and cell migration, which begin within 24 h\nof seeding. During the first week of cultivation, irradiated\ncultures contain a high number of neurons exhibiting large\n\nperikaria and branched neuronal fibers, which interconnect\nto form networks [36]. The possible mechanism of LLLT at\nthe cellular level has been attributed to the acceleration of\nelectron transfer reactions, resulting in the increase of reac-\ntive oxygen species and Ca2+ as versatile second messengers\n[37]. Previous studies have shown that applying LLLT could\ninfluence cellular processes by altering DNA synthesis and\nprotein expression [38], biomodulating cytoskeletal organi-\nzation [39], and stimulating cellular proliferation [38]. Such\nproperties suggest that LLLT, or interventions with similar\nneurobiological effects, can be used to treat neurodegen-\neration, a phenomenon that underlies debilitating clinical\nconditions.\n\nHowever, no obvious differences were observed for GFAP\nand DCX in the test results. This can be explained by the\ndifferentiation agent used in this study, which exerts its effects\nprimarily by inducing ADSCs to differentiate into NSCs.\nTherefore, although the ADSCswere treated using a low-level\nlaser, they still did not differentiate into neural glia cells. The\nDCX protein can only be discovered after neurons have been\nformed from NSCs, which demonstrates that DCX is a late-\nstage protein that cannot be expressed when cells still exhibit\nthe morphology of NSCs. Therefore, the amount of DCX\nexpression is not affected by low-level laser exposure. Wes-\ntern blot analysis was used to determine the amount of\nnestin expression after i-ADSCs were exposed to large-area\nlow-level laser irradiation and culture for 7 days. The res-\nults showed that the amount of nestin was higher with laser\ntreatment. This is similar to the findings from the immu-\nnofluorescent-staining method, indicating that laser irradia-\ntion can accelerate the differentiation ofADSCs into neuronal\ncells. These results indicated that ADSCs can be induced to\ndifferentiate into neuronal cells after treatment by large-area\nlaser irradiation for 10min. Future studies should establish\nthe precise duration of large-area LLLT required to achieve\nimproved results.\n\nIn this study, treadmill and forepaws grip tests were used\nto evaluate motor function recovery after stem cell tran-\nsplantation treatments in rats with stroke. The treadmill test\nresults showed that the running function was weaker for the\nrats in the sham group onDay 7 after treatment.We speculate\nthat this might have been because the brain-tissue lesion area\nfrom ischemia was too large; therefore, the transplanted stem\ncells did not have sufficient time to noticeably repair brain\ntissue. Therefore, the motor functions of the rats remained\nimpaired on Day 7. When tested on Day 14, recoveries in\nmotor functions were observed in both the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\nand i-ADSCs (LS+) groups, with superior recovery in the i-\nADSCs (LS+) group, indicating that the damaged brain tissue\nwas repaired. On Day 21, the recovery of the rats\u2019 running\nfunction was more satisfactory in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nthan in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group, indicating that the brain\ntissue repair capability was superior to that in the i-ADSCs\n(LS+) group.When tested onDay 28, the running function of\nthe rats in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group was close to that of the\nrats in the sham group. However, the motor function of the i-\nADSCs (LS\u2212) group remained impaired, indicating that hind-\npaw motor function recovery was accelerated after i-ADSCs\n(LS+) treatment.\n\n\n\n10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nThe grip test results were similar to the treadmill test\nresults. On Day 7 after stem-cell transplantation treatment\nof the rats with stroke, grip strength was low for both the\ni-ADSCs (LS+) group and i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) groups because\nthe damaged brain tissues were just about to be repaired;\ntherefore, the forepaws of the rats remained weak. When\ntested on Day 14, no major improvement was observed in\nthe grip strength of the rats in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group. By\ncontrast, the grip strength improved considerably in the i-\nADSCs (LS+) group, indicating that the brain tissue repair\ncapability was more satisfactory in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nthan in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group. OnDays 21 and 28, the tests\nshowed that grip strength recovery was more satisfactory in\nthe i-ADSCs (LS+) group than in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) group.\nOn Day 28, the grip strength in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nrecovered to a level close to that of the sham group, indicating\nthat, after i-ADSCs (LS+) treatment, the damaged brain\ntissues of the rats with stroke were repaired quickly, enabling\nthe recovery of forepaw-grip strength. Based on these results,\nwe concluded that damaged brain tissues can be repaired\nfaster and motor function can be recovered efficiently in rats\nwith stroke after i-ADSCs (LS+) treatment.\n\nThe i-ADSCs could differentiate into neuronal cells after\ntransplantation into the brain. As a result, they moved and\nrepaired damaged cerebral tissue selectively and improved\ncerebral functions by enhancing angiogenesis, renewal of\nneurons, and proliferation of nerve cells [40, 41]. In this study,\nwe used the HE-immunostaining method and western blot\nanalysis to evaluate brain tissue repair on Day 28 after stem\ncell transplantation treatment was performed in rats with\nstroke. The results of immunostaining were observed using a\nmicroscope. The structures were magnified 200 times, which\nshowed that the brain tissue in the stroke lesionwas dense and\nsimilar to that of normal brain tissue in the i-ADSCs (LS+)\ngroup. By contrast, numerous cavities were observed in the\nischemic lesions of the brain tissues of the rats in the i-ADSCs\n(LS\u2212) group. These results indicated that necrotizing brain\ntissue after ischemia was quickly repaired when i-ADSCs\n(LS+) was used to treat the rats with stroke.We speculate that\nusing i-ADSCs (LS+) treatment can accelerate the induction\nof ADSCs to differentiate into neuronal cells. Therefore,\nalthough the same number of stem cells was transplanted\nfor treatment, a greater number of NSCs were observed\nin the i-ADSCs (LS+) group than in the i-ADSCs (LS\u2212)\ngroup. Furthermore, because NSCs can protect damaged\nbrain tissues from continuous deterioration, they can also\nhelp brain tissues to repair. Therefore, transplanting a greater\namount of NSCs would likely assist in repairing brain tissues\nmore effectively.\n\nRegarding the results of the western blot analysis, the\noligo-2 amounts after stem-cell transplantation treatment\nwere analyzed. Because oligodendrocytes form myelin in the\ncentral nervous system, myelin levels collapse when oligo-\ndendrocytes die. Nerve conduction is delayed or interrupted\nafter the death of oligodendrocytes, leading to limb disabil-\nities. Therefore, the evaluation of oligo-2 could be a crucial\nreference in assessing the degree of brain tissue recovery\nafter stem-cell transplantation treatments in rats with stroke.\nIn this study, using western blot analysis showed that the\n\namount of expression of oligo-2 in brain tissues treated with\ni-ADSCs (LS+) was similar to that in normal brain tissues.\nBy contrast, brain tissues treated with i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) exhi-\nbited a lower oligo-2 expression, indicating that using i-\nADSCs (LS+) treatment in rats with stroke can repair myelin\nin the central nervous system, leading to the recovery of\nneural-signal conduction and motor function. Based on\nthese experimental results, we concluded that using i-ADSCs\n(LS+) treatment in rats with stroke cannot only accelerate\nthe repair of damaged brain tissues for the partial recovery\nof motor functions, but also enable the central nervous\nsystem to recover the velocity of neural-signal conduction.\nThese results confirm that the transplantation of i-ADSCs\n(LS+) can accelerate repairs in rats with ischemic stroke\nbecause i-ADSCs (LS+) can more efficiently differentiate into\nNSCs.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this study, we used i-ADSCs treated with large-area low-\nlevel laser irradiation to evaluate the effects of a low-level laser\non cell proliferation and differentiation. The results showed\nthat although a low-level laser cannot facilitate cell prolifera-\ntion, it can accelerate the induction of ADSCs differentiating\ninto NSCs. In this study, we successfully created large-area\ncell and tissue damage in rat brains by using an embolic stroke\nanimal model. Stem-cell transplantation with either i-ADSCs\n(LS+) or i-ADSCs (LS\u2212) was performed to evaluate the degree\nof repair after stroke in the animals. Because large-area low-\nlevel laser irradiation can accelerate the differentiation of\nADSCs into NSCs, and NSCs can protect damaged brain tiss-\nues to prevent continuous deterioration from damage and\nto help with repair, the motor function recovery was thus\nsuperior in the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS+) compared\nwith that in the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS\u2212). From the\nbrain tissue slices from each group of rats, we discovered that\ni-ADSCs (LS+) treatment more effectively repaired necrotiz-\ning brain tissues after ischemia in rat brains. Furthermore,\nthe western blot analysis also showed that the amount of\noligo-2 increased in i-ADSCs (LS+)-treated rats with stroke,\nconfirming the repair ofmyelin in cerebral neurons to further\nassist in the recovery of neural-signal conduction in the\ncentral nervous system.\n\nTherefore, in the present study we demonstrated that\nusing large-area low-level lasers exerts positive effects on\ninducing ADSCs differentiation, and it effectively treated\nischemic stroke in rats, regarding motor function recovery.\nIn future studies, the effects of large-area low-level laser irra-\ndiation time and the appropriate dosage for the proliferation\nand differentiation of ADSCs should be evaluated. If the\noptimal irradiation time and dosage for ADSC proliferation\nand differentiation can be discovered in animal experiments\nsimilar to those in this study, we believe that superior\nexperimental results can be obtained. Furthermore, if primate\nor canine experimental animals can be used to conduct\nthe experimental protocols described herein, the concerns\nassociated with individual animal differences and errors\nassociated with motor function assessments can be mini-\nmized to obtain more reliable experimental data. Therefore,\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11\n\nthe findings of this study contribute to the development of\ncell therapy, which can benefit patients with stroke.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThere is no conflict of interests.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Taichung Vete-\nrans General Hospital and Central Taiwan University of Scie-\nnce and Technology (Grant.

Phagocytic activity of naive RAW macro-\nphages was increased either by recombinant mouse (rm) TNF-a or by culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW macro-\nphages. This phagocytic activity was inhibited by addition of anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb). 10t\u201312c CLA also increased\nthe level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW macrophages. When naive RAW macrophages were incubated with the culture super-\nnatant from RAW macrophages treated with 10t\u201312c CLA plus GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist, their phagocytic activity was signifi-\ncantly inhibited. In addition, GW 9662 antagonized the effect of 10t\u201312c CLA in stimulating TNF-a expression. These results suggest\nthat 10t\u201312c CLA modulates the phagocytic activity of RAW macrophages by upregulating TNF-a expression via a PPARc-dependent\npathway.\n\ufffd 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yang).\nas a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid\nmetabolism and is found in various cell types [3,4].\nPPARc is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids\n(PUFAs), the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic\ndrugs, a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nand endogenous ligands such as 15-deoxy-D12,14-PGJ2\n(15d-PGJ2) [5,6]. 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, PPARc\nagonists, inhibit phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA)-induced\nproduction of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and tumor necro-\nsis factor (TNF)-a in peripheral blood monocytes [7].\nHowever, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, also PPARc\nagonists, did not inhibit phorbol ester-induced TNF-a\n\nmailto:mpyang@chungbuk.ac.kr\n\n\n228 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235\nrelease from human monocytic THP-1 cells [8]. This PPARc\nmay regulate inflammatory and immune responses by\nmodulating the activity of monocytes or macrophages.\n\nDietary fatty acids such as linoleic acid and arachidonic\nacid may act as PPARc ligands to modulate lipid metabo-\nlism and suppress carcinogenesis, cytokine production,\nacute inflammation, and lymphocyte proliferation [9\u201311].\nConjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a class of positional\nand geometric isomers of linoleic acid with conjugated\ndouble bonds ranging from 6,8 to 12,14 [12,13]. CLA\nhas shown a wide range of biologically beneficial effects\nsuch as anti-adipogenic activity, including reduction of\nbody fat and lowering cholesterol level, and anti-diabeto-\ngenic, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-atherosclerotic activity\n[14\u201316]. CLA can stimulate or inhibit immune cell func-\ntions. CLA increased TNF-a and IL-6 secretion and\ndecreased IL-4 secretion by splenocytes [17] and reduced\nIL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a production by macrophages [18].\nCLA modulates expression of genes regulated by PPARc\nin muscle and activates PPARc in vitro [19]. In addition,\nexpression of PPARc is enhanced in CLA-fed pigs [20].\nIn contrast, CLA down-regulates expression of PPARc,\nas well as its target genes, fatty acid binding protein and\nliver X receptor a in adipocytes [13]. Murine alveolar mac-\nrophages, which express high levels of PPARc, suppress\noxidative burst activity in response to PMA, expression\nof inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in response to\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-c, and production of\nIL-12 mRNA and protein in response to LPS [21]. These\nreports indicate that the effects of CLA in modulating\nimmune responses are similar to effects induced by ligands\nof PPARc.\n\nTwo CLA isomers, the cis9\u2013trans11 (9c\u201311t) CLA and\ntrans10\u2013cis12 (10t\u201312c) CLA are known to stimulate the\nimmune system [22]. The previous studies [23,24] revealed\nthat 10t\u201312c CLA has directly no effects on phagocytosis\nof peripheral blood phagocytes and on chemotaxis of poly-\nmorphonuclear cells (PMN). However, 10t\u201312c CLA was\nshown to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMC) to secrete soluble factor(s) that increased the che-\nmotactic and phagocytic activity of PMN, which may be an\nimportant mechanism to enhance the innate immune\nresponse. The phagocytic activity of PMN was demon-\nstrated to mediate through TNF-a produced by PBMC\nstimulated with egg white derivatives, one of immunostim-\nulants [25].\n\nWe examined whether TNF-a expression in the phago-\ncytic activity of RAW macrophages by 10t\u201312c CLA is\nassociated with PPARc activation.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. RAW macrophages\n\nThe BALB/c mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7\nwas purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul,\nKorea) and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s\nmedium (Gibco Co., Grand Island, NY, USA) with\n4.5 mg/ml L-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-\nvated fetal calf serum (Gibco Co.) and 100 lg/ml strepto-\nmycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n\n2.2. Reagents\n\n10t\u201312c CLA (98% purity; Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap,\nPA, USA) was purchased commercially. 10t\u201312c CLA\nstock solution was prepared by dissolving 10t\u201312c CLA\nin dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to final 50 mM and passed\nthrough a 0.45 lm-membrane filter (Milipore Co., Bed-\nford, MA, USA) before use. Recombinant mouse (rm)\nTNF-a, goat anti-rmTNF-a polyclonal antibody (pAb),\nrabbit anti-goat IgG alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate,\nGW 9662 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), rmP-\nPARc, rabbit anti-PPARc pAb, goat anti-rabbit IgG\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Santacruz Bio-\ntechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and goat anti-\nrecombinant human (rh) IL-2 pAb (R&D Systems Inc.,\nMinneapolis, MN, USA) were also purchased\ncommercially.\n\n2.3. Culture supernatant\n\n10t\u201312c CLA and/or GW 9662, a PPARc antagonist,\nwere added to RAW 264.7 cells culture media with a min-\nimal volume (<0.1%) of DMSO as the solvent and the same\namount as vehicle DMSO was added to control cells with-\nout 10t\u201312c CLA treatment. The RAW 264.7 cells at a den-\nsity of 5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc\nCo., Naperville, IL, USA) were incubated with 10 lM 10t\u2013\n12c CLA, in the presence or absence of 0.01\u20131 lM GW\n9662 at 37 \ufffdC in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. After\na 24 h-incubation, all culture supernatants were collected\nafter centrifugation at 5000g for 30 min, filtered through\na 0.45 lm-pore size membrane filter and stored at \ufffd70 \ufffdC\nuntil used. The viability of RAW 264.7 cells was consis-\ntently more than 90% at the time of culture supernatant\ncollection, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.\n\n2.4. Protein extraction and Western blot\n\nThe cultured RAW 264.7 cells were lysed in ice-cold\nPRO-PREP\ufffd (iNtRon Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea)\nprotein extraction solution, according to the manufac-\nturer\u2019s protocol. Protein concentrations of RAW 264.7\ncells lysate and culture supernatant were determined using\nthe Bradford assay [26]. Electrophoresis of protein lysates\nwas performed using a 12% polyacrylamide separating\ngel (5% stacking gel) in a Tris\u2013glycine buffer system under\ndenaturing conditions. All samples were mixed with an\nequal volume of sample buffer, boiled, and loaded onto\nthe gel. Proteins were transferred (Trans-Blot\ufffd Cell;\nBio-Rad Lab., Hercules, CA, USA) onto 0.2 lm-nitrocel-\nlulose membranes (Sartorius AG., Gottingen, Germany)\nat 300 mA for 3 h. Non-specific binding sites were blocked\n\n\n\nD.-H.

Membranes\nwere subsequently incubated for 2 h at room temperature\nin 0.5% BSA\u2013TBST containing either a rabbit antipeptide\npAb raised against a synthetic PPARc peptide synthesized\nusing the mouse PPARc sequence, or goat anti-rmTNF-a\npAb. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes\nwere incubated with either anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with\nHRP or anti-goat IgG conjugated with AP in 0.5% BSA/\nTBST for 2 h. The membranes were washed twice with\nTBST and once with TBS. The membranes with HRP con-\njugated antibody were incubated in chemiluminescent sub-\nstrate and exposed to Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak,\nRochester, NY, USA). The membranes with AP conju-\ngated antibody were incubated with nitro blue tetrazolium\nchloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/\nBCIP) (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Ger-\nmany) in alkaline phosphatase buffer containing 0.1 M\nTris\u2013HCl (pH 9.5), 0.1 M NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. The\nreaction was stopped by rinsing membranes with 20 mM\nEDTA in TBS.\n\n2.5. Phagocytic activity analyses\n\nOne hundred microliter of RAW 264.7 cells, adjusted\nto 5 \u00b7 106 cells/ml, was added to each well of a 24-well\nplate. The RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with\nrmTNF-a and culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells\n(5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with either 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA\nalone or in combination with 0.01\u20131 lM GW 9662 for\n12 h at 37 \ufffdC under a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere.\nFor neutralization test, various concentrations of anti-\nrmTNF-a pAb were mixed with 10t\u201312c CLA-stimulated\nRAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant. Goat anti-rhIL-2\npAb was used as a control isotype IgG. The samples were\nmixed and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Ten\nmicroliter of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-latex\nbeads (1 \u00b7 109 beads/ml, latex bead size, 2.0 lm; Poly-\nsciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) were added to each\nwell for the final 2 h. RAW 264.7 cells incubated without\nFITC-latex beads were used as a negative control. The\ncultured cells were harvested gently by slow pipetting,\ncentrifuged at 400g for 3 min and washed three times with\nPBS containing 3 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid\n(EDTA). The supernatant was discarded and replaced\nwith 1 ml PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde to stabi-\nlize the cells. Phagocytic activity was measured by flow\ncytometry (BRYTE HS, Bio-Rad, Microscience Ltd.,\nEngland) and surface-adherent FITC fluorescence on\nRAW 264.7 cells was quenched by addition of 20 ll of\na 0.4% trypan blue solution to each tube before flow\ncytometry analysis. FITC fluorescence was measured\nbetween 520 and 560 nm on 5000 RAW 264.7 cells per\nsample. The cells were gated by forward and side light\nscatter characteristics. The results were expressed as per-\ncentages of absolute phagocytic activities.\n2.6. RNA isolation\n\nTotal RNA was prepared from RAW 264.7 cells using\nthe TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nRAW 264.7 cells were mixed with 1 ml TRIzol reagent.\nChloroform (200 ll per 1 ml TRIzol reagent) was added\nand the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 s. The\nlysate was centrifuged for phase separation at 13,000g for\n10 min. After separation, the aqueous phase was trans-\nferred to a fresh tube, 500 ll of isopropyl alcohol was\nadded and the tube gently inverted to mix. The samples\nwere centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was removed\nand the visible pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol.\nThe RNA pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate\n(DEPC)-treated water, and the concentration of RNA\nwas determined by absorbance at 260 nm.\n2.7. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-\n\nPCR) analysis\n\nTotal RNA (2 lg) was reverse transcribed into first\nstrand complementary DNA (cDNA) using the Moloney-\nmurine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase\n(Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) and a random primer\n(9 mer). To determine the conditions under which PCR\namplification of PPARc, TNF-a, and cytochrome c\noxidase subunit I(1A) mRNA are in the logarithmic phase,\n1 ll samples were amplified using different numbers of\ncycles. The 1A gene was PCR amplified to control for\nRNA degradation and variation in mRNA concentrations\nin the reverse transcription (RT) reaction. PCR products\nand amplification cycles were linearly related in PPARc,\nTNF-a, and 1A mRNAs. Thirty cycles of PCR for PPARc\nand TNF-a and 25 cycles for 1A were used for quantifica-\ntion. The cDNA was amplified in a 20 ll PCR reaction\ncontaining 1 unit Taq polymerase in PCR buffer (Promega\nCo., Madison, WI, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTP,\nand 50 pmol of specific primers. PCR reactions were dena-\ntured at 95 \ufffdC for 1 min, annealed at 50 \ufffdC for 1 min, and\nextended at 72 \ufffdC for 1.5 min. The cDNA sequences for the\ndetection of transcripts of PPARc, TNF-a and 1A were\nobtained by RT using the following primers (Macrogen\nInc., Seoul, Korea). The PPARc primers were based on\nthe deposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.\nNM011146): 5 0-GAA AAG ACC CAG CTC TAC AAC-\n3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTT CAG CTG GTC GAT ATC\nAC-3 0 (reverse). The TNF-a primers were based on the\ndeposited cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No.\nNM013693): 5 0-CCT CCC TCT CAT CAG TTC TAT-3 0\n\n(forward) and 5 0-GAG GTT GAC TTT CTC CTC CTG\nGT-3 0 (reverse). The 1A gene primers (GenBank Accession\nNo. J01420) were: 5 0-CAC CGT AGG AGG TCT AAC G-\n3 0 (forward) and 5 0-GTA TCG TCG AGG TAT TCC G-3 0\n\n(reverse). PCR products (10 ll) were electrophoresed on a\n2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.\nPhotographs of the gels were scanned and analyzed using\n\n\n\n230 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235\na digital analysis program (Gel Doc 1000, version 1.5,\nBio-Rad Lab.).\n\n2.8. Data analyses\n\nThe one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett\u2019s\ntest for each pair for multiple comparisons was used in\norder to determine statistical significance. Comparisons\nof two groups at each GW 9662 concentration were made\nby Student\u2018s t-test. All data expressed as mean \u00b1 standard\nerror of the mean (SEM).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1.

A single protein band with a molecu-\nlar weight of 16\u201318 kDa was present in culture supernatant\nfrom RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA and\nrmTNF-a samples, but not medium alone or culture super-\nnatant from RAW 264.7 cells incubated with vehicle\n(DMSO) instead of 10t\u201312c CLA (Fig. 1A). 10t\u201312c CLA\n(10 lM) stimulation of TNF-a mRNA expression in\nRAW 264.7 cells was also examined. As shown in\nFig. 1B, TNF-a mRNA expression of RAW 264.7 cells\nwas detected by RT-PCR and peaked after 1 h of incuba-\ntion with 10t\u201312c CLA.\n3.2.

Phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells. (A) Effect of culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW 264.7 cells on phagocytic activity of\nnaive RAW 264.7 cells. RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) were incubated for 12 h with the culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml)\nthat had been treated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h. (B) Effect of rmTNF-a on phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells. RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/\nml) were incubated for 12 h with rmTNF-a at the indicated concentrations. Culture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10 lM 10t\u2013\n12c CLA for 24 h was used as the positive control. (C) Neutralization effect of anti-rmTNF-a pAb on phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by\n10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant. Anti-rmTNF-a pAb at the indicated concentrations and goat anti-rhIL-2 pAb as a control\nisotype IgG were added to the culture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h. RAW 264.7\ncell cultures were incubated with these samples for 30 min. All cultures were supplemented with 10 ll of FITC-latex beads (1 \u00b7 109 beads/ml) for the final\n2 h. The phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was measured using flow cytometry. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3, **P < 0.01, compared\nto control (in panel A), vehicle-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatant (in panel B) and 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW264.7 cell culture supernatant\n(12.5%) (in panel C).\n\nD.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235 231\n\n\n\n232 D.-H. Song et al. / Cytokine 37 (2007) 227\u2013235\nthat had been treated with 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h was sig-\nnificantly enhanced (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner\ncompared to controls and showed the highest level of stim-\nulation at 12.5% culture supernatant (Fig. 2A). The phag-\nocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells was also significantly\nincreased (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner by addi-\ntion of 0.01\u201310 ng/ml rmTNF-a compared to the response\nto culture supernatant (12.5%) of RAW 264.7 cells treated\nwith vehicle (DMSO) instead of 10t\u201312c CLA for 24 h and\nwas highest at 1 ng/ml rmTNF-a (Fig. 2B). The effect of\nanti-rmTNF-a pAb on the phagocytic activity of RAW\n264.7 cells in response to the culture supernatant from\nRAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA was examined.\nThe enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells to\nculture supernatant (12.5%) from RAW 264.7 cells\n(5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) treated with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA for\n24 h was inhibited (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner\nby addition of 0.001\u20131 lg/ml anti-rmTNF-a pAb, when\ncompared to the activity induced by the 10t\u201312c CLA-trea-\nted culture supernatant alone (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the\nenhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells in\nresponse to culture supernatant treated with 10t\u201312c\nCLA was not inhibited by addition of anti-rhIL-2 pAb\n(1 lg/ml: control IgG) instead of anti-rmTNF-a pAb.\nFig. 3.

Effect of 10t\u201312c CLA on PPARc expression of RAW\nmacrophages\n\nRAW 264.7 cells were incubated with 10t\u201312c CLA and\nharvested for total protein and RNA isolation. Western\nblot analysis showed that a 24 h-incubation of RAW\n264.7 cells (5 \u00b7 105 cells/ml) with 10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA\ninduced PPARc protein expression (Fig. 3A). A detectable\nPPARc protein was also found in untreated RAW 264.7\nwhen larger amounts of cell lysate (40 lg) were analyzed.\nRT-PCR analysis revealed that PPARc mRNA expression\nin RAW 264.7 cells was induced by 10t\u201312c CLA treatment\nand peaked at 1 h-incubation, although minor expression\nof PPARc was detected in untreated RAW 264.7 cells\n(Fig. 3B).\n\n3.4.

As shown in\nFig. 4A, the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells\ninduced by 10t\u201312c CLA-treated RAW 264.7 cell culture\nsupernatant was inhibited (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent\nmanner by culture supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells\ntreated with 10t\u201312c CLA plus GW 9662, compared to\n10t\u201312c CLA-treated culture supernatant alone. In\naddition, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis showed\nthat 0.01\u20131 lM GW 9662 antagonized the expression of\nTNF-a protein (Fig. 4B) and mRNA (Fig. 4C) of RAW\n264.7 cells induced by 10t\u201312c CLA, in a dose-dependent\nmanner.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nExpression of TNF-a is elevated in undifferentiated\nhuman monocytes or incompletely differentiated macro-\nphage RAW 264.7 cells in comparison to differentiated\nhuman macrophages [27]. High concentrations of the\nPPARc ligands troglitazone (30 lM) and 15d-PGJ2\n(10 lM) inhibited the expression of TNF-a as well as\ndecreased the cell viability in vitro [28]. In contrast,\n10 lM 10t\u201312c CLA, used in this study, up-regulated\nTNF-a expression and maintained a high RAW 264.7 cell\nviability of greater than 90%. The phagocytic activity of\nRAW 264.7 cells was enhanced by either culture superna-\ntant from RAW 264.7 cells treated with 10t\u201312c CLA or\nrmTNF-a. In addition, anti-rmTNF-a pAb neutralized\nthe enhanced phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells stim-\nulated by culture supernatant from 10t\u201312c CLA treated\nRAW 264.7 cells. These findings indicate that 10t\u201312c\nCLA stimulates RAW 264.7 cells to produce TNF-a, which\nenhances the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells.\n\nTNF-a is a natural stimulant which promotes the phag-\nocytic activity of phagocytes [29]. It has beeen reported that\nthe enhanced phagocytic activity of PMN by culture super-\nnatant from PBMC treated with immunostimulating egg\nwhite derivatives, was due to TNF-a, but not IL-1 [25].\nRats fed a diet containing 10t\u201312c CLA have the enhanced\nphagocytic activity of phagocytes, correlated with an\nincrease in plasma TNF-a [30]. The CLA stimulated tumor\ncell killing ability of macrophages has been associated with\ninduction of TNF-a expression [31]. It has been also\nreported that CLA decreases the synthesis of prostaglandin\nE2 (PGE2) [32], and PGE2 has been shown to have\nprofound down-regulatory effects on various inflammatory\ncells [33]. PGE2 has been reported to regulate macrophage\nTNF-a production through negative feedback [34]. There-\nfore, one possible explanation for increased TNF-a\nexpression in porcine PBMC treated with t10c12-CLA\nmay be related to decreased PGE2 regulation of TNF-a.\n\nThe results demonstrated that 10t-12c CLA increased\nthe level of PPARc protein and mRNA in RAW 264.7\ncells. This finding is consistent with reports that the expres-\nsion of PPARc was increased in CLA-fed pigs [20] and\nthat the supplementation of CLA in the diet enhanced\nthe colonic expression of PPARc [35]. Since CLA under-\ngoes elongation and desaturation processes similar to those\nof polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic\nacid, D6 desaturase metabolites of CLA can also activate\nPPARc expression [12]. Thus, the induction of PPARc\nexpression may occur through direct binding of CLA as\nwell as active metabolites of CLA [36]. These results\nsuggest that CLA acts as a ligand of PPARc and activates\nPPARc.\n\nThe present study indicates that 10t\u201312c CLA stimulates\nboth PPARc and TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells.\nWe used a specific and high affinity PPARc antagonist\n(nanomolar IC50, [37]), GW 9662, to elucidate the role of\nPPARc on TNF-a expression in RAW 264.7 cells induced\nby 10t\u201312c CLA. GW 9662 antagonized the effect of\n10t\u201312c CLA on TNF-a expression of RAW 264.7 cells\nas well as their phagocytic activity induced by TNF-a.\nThese results suggest that the effects of 10t\u201312c-CLA on\nTNF-a production in RAW 264.7 cells may be dependent\non the PPARc pathway. High affinity PPARc ligands such\nas the thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic agent AD-5075\nand the non-TZD insulin-sensitizing agent L-796,499 did\nnot inhibit production of TNF-a and IL-6 in RAW 264.7\ncells [38].\n\nIn conclusion, the overall results of this study show that\nthe effect of 10t\u201312c CLA on the phagocytic activity of\nRAW 264.7 macrophages might be mediated by TNF-a\nexpression via a PPARc-dependent pathway.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the National Livestock Re-\nsearch Institute and the ministry of Education and Human\nResources Development (MOE), the Ministry of Com-\nmerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE) and the Ministry\nof Labor (MOLAB) through the fostering project of the\nlab of Excellency.

Electroacupuncture (EA), which derives from traditional Chinesemedicine,may be effective as a complementary\nand alternative method for promoting recovery of neurological function and quality of life. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were\nrandomly divided into 3 groups: (1) sham, (2) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model groups of 2 h MCAO followed\nby 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion, and (3) EA groups of 2 h MCAO followed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion. EA groups received\nEA therapy by needling at GV20 and left ST36. The results show that EA therapy improved the neurological function and reduced\ninfarct volume, confirmed bymodified neurological severity scores and TTC staining. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and\nwestern blot assay verified that EA upregulated the expression of tight junction (TJ) claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occluding-1\nfrom 1 to 7 d after reperfusion. Our findings suggest that EA reduces brain damage and related behavioral deficits via upregulation\nof the TJ proteins.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nStrokes are either ischemic or hemorrhagic, with more than\n80% of stroke cases caused by cerebral ischemia [1]. Although\nmany advances have been made in the treatment of stroke,\ncurrent therapies are lacking in effectiveness. There is a\nsignificant unmet need for developing novel and rational\nstrategies aimed at reducing nervous system impairments\ncaused by cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI). Elec-\ntroacupuncture (EA) was derived 2,500 years ago in ancient\nChina and has been an alternative therapy complement-\ning conventional medicine for stroke. Our previous studies\ndemonstrated that EA at Baihui (GV20) and Zusanli (ST36)\nin rats after CIRI improves the neurological score and reduces\nthe expression of MMP-9 and the inflammatory reaction in\nbrains of rats [2, 3]. EA has recently been shown to accelerate\nrehabilitation of patients with brain ischemia. However, the\npotential mechanism is not fully understood; more evidence\nis needed before EA treatment is accepted clinically.\n\nReperfusion is necessary to restore blood flow and reduce\nneuronal damage caused by ischemia. However, brain dam-\nage even became worse after the blood flow is restored\n[4, 5]. The development of safe and effective agents to\nalleviate cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury will certainly\nimprove the prognosis of ischemic stroke. Many pathological\nmechanisms, like inflammation, increase reactive oxygen\nspecies and brain edema, leading to blood-brain barrier\n(BBB) destruction. Postischemic reperfusion causes edema\nformation by targeting cerebral capillary endothelial cells,\nan important component of neuronal microenvironment\ncalled the neurovascular unit (NVU). Other components\ninclude astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and extracellular\nmatrix around the vessels [6]. These components together\nform the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that protects the brain\nfrom potentially toxic substances and regulates the passage\nof circulating molecules according to size and physical-\nchemical characteristics [7]. Tight junctions (TJs) are located\nbetween adjacent endothelial cells of the BBB and function\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nVolume 2014, Article ID 989340, 10 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/989340\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nas gates for molecular transportation through paracellular\nclefts [8]. TJ is a complex network of proteins including the\ntransmembrane proteins occludins, claudins, and peripheral\nmembrane protein family of zonula occludins (ZOs) and\nother molecules. TJs respond to cellular stimuli dynamically\nvia disassembly, redistribution, degradation, and remodeling\ntomaintain the structural and functional integrity of the BBB\n[9, 10]. ZO-1 acts as a crucial central regulator of the structural\norganization of the TJ. It is expressed around the vessels,\nespecially at sites of endothelial cell-cell contact, suggesting\nthat ZO-1 preserves the integrity of the BBB [11]. In fact,\na decrease in ZO-1 increases brain edema [12]. Claudin-5\nand occludin are localized at the leading edge of the brain\nmicrovascular cells and are the major protein components of\nthe transmembrane. TJs act as significant roles in regulating\nthe permeability of BBB [8, 13]. Studies show changes in ZO-\n1 and occludin expression which are consistent with BBB\npermeability changes and are related to BBB opening [14,\n15]. Decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of ZO-\n1, claudin-5, and occludin are closely associated with BBB\nbreakdown and edema in the ischemic brain [16] and also the\nneuroprotective effects of chemical agents against ischemic\ninjury through the prevention of TJ protein downregulation\n[17].\n\nIn the present study, we evaluated how EA at GV20\nand ST36 changed infarct volumes, neurological deficits, and\nexpression levels of TJ-associated proteins ZO-1, claudin-5,\nand occludin following cerebral ischemia reperfusion within\n7 d in Sprague-Dawley rats.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Animals. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (\ud835\udc5b =\n90) weighing 230\u2013250 g (Peking Union Medical College\nHospital, Beijing, China) were housed in an environmentally\ncontrolled room at 22 \u00b1 2\u2218C, with a 12 h/12 h light/dark\ncycle, and the rats were allowed free access to food and\nwater throughout the whole study. The study was approved\nby the Ethics Committees of Peking Union Medical College\nHospital and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for the\nCare and Use of Laboratory Animals, and we made all efforts\nto minimize the animal suffering in the study.\n\n2.2. Rat Model of Cerebral Ischemia Reperfusion. Focal cere-\nbral ischemia was established in the rats based on the\nmethods described by Longa et al. [18]. Briefly, rats were anes-\nthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (100 g/0.3mL, intraperi-\ntoneal injection). The right common carotid artery (CCA),\nexternal carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery\n(ICA) were exposed. A 4\u20130 suture (diameter 0.26mm) with\na blunted tip coated with poly-L-lysine was gently advanced\ninto the ICA through the ECA. The suture was advanced\n18\u201320mm (reaching the origin of the right middle cerebral\nartery) beyond the carotid artery bifurcation. To allow the\nreperfusion, the suture was slowly withdrawn after 2 h of\nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).\n\n2.3. Grouping and Treatment. Rats were randomly divided\ninto the following 3 groups: (1) sham, (2) middle cerebral\n\nartery occlusion (MCAO) model group of 2 h MCAO fol-\nlowed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion, and (3) EA groups of\n2 hMCAO followed by 1, 3, 5, or 7 d of reperfusion.The sham\ngroup rats received all surgical procedures, but the suture was\nnot advanced into the ICA. No treatments were conducted in\nthe sham and the MCAOmodel groups.\n\nRats in the EA groups received the first EA treatment after\nthe withdrawal of the suture after 2 h of MCAO and then\nreceived EA treatment 20min session once daily. GV20 is\nlocated on the top of the head at the intersection of themiddle\nsagittal line and the connection of two ear apexes. ST36 is\nlocated 3 individual cun below genu and one fingerbreadth\nbefore the anterior crest of the tibia. The rats in the EA\ngroups were needled at GV20 and ST36 with disposable,\nsterile acupuncture needles. Two electrodes (Changzhou\nWujin Great Wall Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) were\nattached for acupuncture and continuous-wave stimulation\nat a frequency of 2Hz (intensity 1mA) for 20min. The 20-\nminute session once daily EA regiment for the intervention\ngroup was chosen based on our previously described reports\n[2, 19] and from stroke patients in clinical practice [20].\n\n2.4. Neurological Functional Evaluation. We evaluated neu-\nrological function in the rats (\ud835\udc5b = 9) at 1, 3, 5, and\n7 d postreperfusion using the modified neurological severity\nscores (mNSS) [21] by an observer with no prior knowledge\nof the groups and treatments. The mNSS was composed of\nmotor, sensory, balance beam test, and reflex tests and graded\nfrom0 to 18. AhighermNSS score correlateswithmore severe\ninjury (Table 1).\n\n2.5. Infarct Volume Assessment. Rats (\ud835\udc5b = 3) were narco-\ntized by an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate\n(100 g/0.3mL) and sacrificed by decapitation 7 d after reper-\nfusion to evaluate the volume of cerebral infarction. Brains\nwere quickly removed and chilled in \u221220\u2218C refrigerator for\n10min, and five 2mm consecutive coronal slices were made\nbeginning from the anterior pole. The slices were put into\na solution of 0.1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;\nSigma, USA) in PBS for 30min at 37\u2218C in darkness before\nbeing transferred into 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The\ninfarct region appeared white, and the normal tissue was red.\nTo account for edema and differential shrinkage resulting\nfrom tissue processing, the percentage of infarct volume was\ncalculated as follows: [(VC\u2212VL)/VC] \u00d7100%; VC represents\nthe volume of the control hemisphere, and VL is the volume\nof the noninfarct tissue in the lesion hemisphere [22]. The\nsections were photographed and infarct size measured using\nimage analysis software (ImageJ, NIH) by an observer with\nno prior knowledge of the experiment.\n\n2.6. Immunohistochemistry. We used immunohistochemi-\ncal staining to detect distribution and expression of ZO-\n1, claudin-5, and occludin in rats after cerebral ischemia\nreperfusion. At 1, 3, 5, and 7 d post-MCAO reperfusion, rats\n(\ud835\udc5b = 6) were narcotized and perfused transcardially with\n250mL of saline followed by 250mL of 4%paraformaldehyde\nsolution. Brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformalde-\nhyde solution at 4\u2218C for 72 h and then dehydrated and\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nTable 1: Description of the mNSS [21].\n\nPoints\nMotor tests\n\nRaising the tail of rat 3\n1 forelimb flexion\n1 hindlimb flexion\n1 head moved >10\u2218 to vertical axis within 30 s\n\nPlacing rat on floor 3\n0 walking normally\n1 unable to walk straight\n2 circling toward paretic side\n3 falling down to paretic side\n\nSensory tests 2\n1 placing test\n2 proprioceptive test\n\nBeam balance tests 6\n0 balance with steady posture\n1 grasp the side of beam\n2 hug beam with 1 limb falls down from beam\n3 on the basis of 2, but 2 limbs fall down from beam (>60 s)\n4 attempt to balance on beam but falls off (>40 s)\n5 on the basis of 4, but (>20 s)\n6 drop from the beam or with no action (<20 s)\n\nReflex absence and abnormal movements 4\n1 pinna reflex\n1 corneal reflex\n1 startle reflex\n1 seizures, myoclonus, and myodystony\n\nMaximum 18\n\nembedded in paraffin blocks. Coronal sections at the level\nof optic chiasma in the infarct region were cut into 3 \ud835\udf07m\nthick pieces. Briefly, brain sections were deparaffinized and\nhydrated with decreasing concentrations of alcohol and then\nincubated for 15min in 1% Triton X-100 to disrupt the cell\nmembrane. The sections were incubated with 3% H\n\n2\nO\n2\n\nand 5% normal goat serum at room temperature for 30min\neach. Brain sections were incubated overnight at 4\u2218C with\nrabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 antibody (diluted 1 : 150; Zymed,\nUSA), goat polyclonal anti-claudin-5 antibody (diluted 1 : 50;\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-\noccludin antibody (diluted 1 : 150; Abcam, UK) and then the\nremaining procedures accorded with the standard proce-\ndures. Brain sections were photographed (Leica DM4000,\nGermany) and analyzed using image analysis software (Image\nJ, NIH) for semiquantitative tests of MMP-2, AQP4, and\nAQP9 integrated optical density (IOD).\n\n2.7. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Anal-\nyses (qPCR). Expression levels of mRNA for ZO-1, claudin-\n5, and occludin in the rats (\ud835\udc5b = 3) were determined by\nqPCR. Total RNAs were extracted from the ischemic hemi-\nsphere using the RNeasy mini kit (Omega, USA) and\nreverse transcribed to cDNA. The reverse transcription (RT)\nreaction was amplified on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Detection\nSystem (Applied Biosystems, USA) using the Plexor One-\nStep qRT-PCR System (Promega A4021, USA). For ZO-1,\n\nclaudin-5, and occludin, the following primers were used:\nZO-1 forward: 5\udba0\udc20-GATGAGCGGGCTACCTTATTGA-3\udba0\udc20,\nreverse 5\udba0\udc20-TTGGTCGGGAGATCGTGACTG-3\udba0\udc20; claudin-\n5 forward: 5\udba0\udc20-GGTGAGCATTCGGTCTTTAGC-3\udba0\udc20, reverse\n5\udba0\udc20-TTGTGGTCCAGGAAGGCAGT-3\udba0\udc20; occludin forward:\n5\udba0\udc20-TGGGACAGAGCCTATGGAACG-3\udba0\udc20, reverse 5\udba0\udc20-TTG-\nGTCGGGAGATCGTGACTG-3\udba0\udc20.The fold change of relative\nmRNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct [23]\nmethod and using GADPH as an endogenous reference:\nGADPH forward: 5\udba0\udc20-CACAGCAAGTTCAACGGCACAG-\n3\udba0\udc20, reverse 5\udba0\udc20-GACGCCAGTAGACTCCACGACA-3.\n\n2.8. Western Blot Analysis. The ischemic hemispheres of the\nrats (\ud835\udc5b = 3) were homogenized in Radio-Immunoprecipita-\ntion Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology,\nChina); proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 g\nfor 15min at 4\u2218C. Supernatants were harvested and the\nprotein concentration of each sample was determined by\nbicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Beyotime Biotechnology,\nChina). For gel electrophoresis, samples were separated\non 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; separated proteins were\nelectrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mem-\nbranes (Millipore, USA). Membranes were blocked for 2 h\nwith 5% nonfat milk (BD, USA) at room temperature and\nthen were incubated overnight at 4\u2218C with primary antibod-\nies: rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 antibodies (diluted 1 : 500;\nZymed, USA), goat polyclonal anti-claudin-5 antibodies\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n(diluted 1 : 200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), and rabbit\npolyclonal anti-occludin antibodies (diluted 1 : 300; Abcam,\nUK).After threewashes,membraneswere incubated for 2 h at\nroom temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody\n(1 : 5000; Jackson, USA). Detection was performed using an\nECL kit (Millipore, USA). Blots were subsequently probed\nfor \ud835\udefd-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) as an internal\ncontrol for normalization of protein loading. The intensities\nof the bands were measured using image analysis software\n(Labworks 4.6, China).\n\n2.9. Statistical Analysis. All data were analyzed with the\nstatistical analysis software SPSS (Statistical Package for the\nSocial Sciences) 17.0 and are presented as themean\u00b1 standard\ndeviation (SD). Differences among multiple groups were\nanalyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by LSD t-test.\nStatistical significance was assumed in all cases if \ud835\udc43 < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. EA Improved the Neurological Function in Focal Cerebral\nIschemia Rats. We performed a neurological functional test\nto determine whether acupuncture treatment of CIRI rats\nregulates functional outcome.We assessed neurological func-\ntion of the rats at 1, 3, 5, and 7 d after reperfusion using\nthe mNSS. Rats receiving EA treatment showed significant\nimprovement in neurological function compared to the\nMCAO model groups at the same time points (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05,\n\ud835\udc5b = 9) (Figure 1).\n\n3.2. EA Reduced Infarct Volume in Focal Cerebral Ischemia\nRats. TTC assay results show that the infarct regions\nremained white while the normal brain tissues were red\n(Figure 2). In the ischemic hemisphere, the cerebral infarc-\ntion areas included frontoparietal cortex, temporal cortex,\nand lateral portion of neostriatum. EA treatment significantly\ndecreased the volume of infarct regions at days 1 and 7\ncompared with untreated animals (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05, \ud835\udc5b = 3, Figure 3).\nThese results support the neuroprotective effect of EA treat-\nment against cerebral ischemic injury.\n\n3.3. EA Changed the Distribution and Expression of mRNA\nand Protein of Tight-Junction Proteins ZO-1, Claudin-5, and\nOccludin in Focal Cerebral Ischemia Rats. We explored\nwhether EA treatment maintains the BBB permeability via\nmodulation of TJ proteins. We evaluated the distribution\nof ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin by immunohistochemical\nstaining, gene expression by qPCR, and protein expression\nwestern blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry staining results\nrevealed that the expressions of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin\nwere localized continuously on the cerebral microvessels\nin the sham group. In contrast, the expression of ZO-\n1, claudin-5, and occludin in the cerebral vascular struc-\ntures in both MCAO and EA groups following reperfusion\nshowed discontinuous staining and significant disruptions.\nExpression of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin decreased at\ndays 1 to 5 d and then increased at day 7. The integrated\noptical density values of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin were\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nN\neu\n\nro\nlo\n\ngi\nca\n\nl f\nun\n\nct\nio\n\nn \n(m\n\nN\nSS\n\n )\n\nSham\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394 \u2217\u0394 \u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\u0394\n\u0394 \u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u22c6 \u22c6 \u22c6\n\n\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\nFigure 1: Neurological functional outcome.

Rats receiving EA treatment\nshowed significant improvement in neurological function compared\nwith theMCAOmodel groups at the same time points. Data (\ud835\udc5b = 9)\nis represented as mean \u00b1 SD. \u0394\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 versus the sham group,\n\udb8c\udc05\n\n\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 versus the MCAO group at the same time points, and\n\u2217\n\n\ud835\udc43 < 0.05 versus the EA groups at the same time points.\n\nincreased significantly after EA treatment at 1, 3, 5, and 7 d\nafter reperfusion compared to the MCAO groups (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05,\nFigure 4). qPCR results showmRNA expression levels of ZO-\n1 and occludin in MCAO groups and EA groups significantly\ndeclined compared to the sham group, but expression was\nsignificantly strengthened after EA treatment (\ud835\udc43 < 0.01,\nFigure 5).\n\nWe analyzed changes in TJ protein expression induced\nby EA via western blot. Results show protein levels of ZO-1,\nclaudin-5, and occludin in ischemic cerebral areawere consis-\ntent with findings obtained from the immunohistochemical\nstaining and qPCR (Figure 5). The protein expression levels\nof ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin were significantly improved\nin the EA groups as compared with the MCAO groups at 1, 3,\n5, and 7 d (\ud835\udc43 < 0.05, Figure 6). These data show EA therapy\nwas effective on CIRI.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we provide evidence showing EA at GV20\nand ST36 in rats after CIRI reduced the ischemic brain\ndamage in models of focal cerebral ischemia within 7 d\nof reperfusion. EA therapy was proved to reduce infarct\nvolume and improve neurological functional outcome in\nacute ischemic stroke rats. We show that EA promotes\nBBB tightness by alleviating the disruption of the TJ-related\nproteins ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin during the process of\ncerebral ischemia reperfusion. We argue that EA ameliorates\nfocal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury via modulation of\nTJ protein expression. Our findings suggest that EA should\nbe considered complementary and alternative medicine for\nalleviating cerebral ischemia.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\n\nSham MCAO\n\nafter 2hr MCAO\n7d postreperfusion\n\nEA\n\nafter 2 hr MCAO\n7d postreperfusion\n\nFigure 2: TTC staining of brain slices.

However, reperfusion damage to the\nbrain acts a crucial role in the pathophysiology of cerebral\nischemic stroke [4, 5]. Clinically, ischemia reperfusion injury\nhas become a challenge in ischemic cerebrovascular disease.\nMany pathological mechanisms are associated with reper-\nfusion injury including inflammation, increase in reactive\n\noxygen species, brain edema, BBB destruction, necrosis, and\napoptosis.\n\nThe BBB consists of brain microvascular endothelial\ncells and astroglial cell end-feet that protect the brain from\npotentially toxic substances. It also regulates the passage\nof circulating molecules on the basis of size and physical-\nchemical characteristics. BBB disruption and brain edema\nformation both act important roles in the development\nof neurological dysfunction in acute and chronic cerebral\nischemia. The structural and functional integrity of the\nBBB is maintained by interendothelial cell TJs. The BBB is\nconstructed of TJs, including occludin and claudin-5, which\nform the endothelial barrier. TJs are a complex network\nof proteins and consisted of the transmembrane proteins\n(occludins, claudins, and junctional adhesionmolecules) and\nperipheral membrane protein family of ZOs (ZO-1, ZO-2,\nandZO-3). At themolecular level, the proteins ZO-1, claudin-\n5, and occludin are highly enriched at the TJ [8]. The TJs\nrestrict the paracellular movement of solutes (water soluble\nand polar compounds) and small ions. ZO-1 is expressed\naround the vessels, especially at sites of endothelial cell-\ncell contact. ZO-1 acts as a crucial central regulator of the\nstructural organization of the TJ and preserves the integrity\nof the BBB [11]. In fact, a decrease in ZO-1 coincides with\nan increase in cerebral edema [12]. The claudin family,\nspecifically claudin-5, which is localized at the leading edge of\nbrain microvascular cells, is important intercellular junction\nproteins and essential for the modulation of endothelial\npermeability. Previous reports prove that downregulation of\nclaudin-5 is closely related to cerebral ischemia [8, 13, 24]. TJ\nprotein occludin is critically involved in sealing the TJ [25],\nand its disruption alone is enough to cause functional changes\nof the TJ [26]. It also has been demonstrated that occludin\nis significantly reduced in CIRI rats [27]. Some chemical\nagents are neuroprotective against ischemic injury via the\nprevention of TJ protein downregulation [17]. Decreased\nexpression of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin mRNA and\nprotein is associated with BBB breakdown and edema in the\nischemic brain [14, 16].\n\nTJ protein downregulation, translocation, or phospho-\nrylation is closely related with the BBB breakdown in focal\ncerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. However, there is lim-\nited data describing the relationship between TJ protein\nand recovery of ischemic stroke. Growing research on other\ncentral nervous system diseases, like multiple sclerosis, brain\ntumors, Parkinson\u2019s, and Alzheimer\u2019s, suggests that disrup-\ntion of TJ integrity is associated with BBB dysfunctions.\nVarious molecular mechanisms including downregulation,\nphosphorylation, degradation, or translocation of TJ proteins\nmay work in the pathological process of these diseases [28\u2013\n32].\n\nWe are in need of effective neuroprotective methods and\nrational strategies aimed at preventing CIRI and reducing\nimpairments caused by it. Acupuncture is one of the major\ncomplementary and alternative therapies for stroke, and it\nhas gained public support. According to traditional Chinese\nmedicine, the body is an interconnected and self-contained\nsystem, relying on many factors to maintain a balanced and\nhealthy state. Qi, blood, ying, and yang are vital matters\n\n\n\n6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nZO-1\nSham M1 M3 M5 M7 E1 E3 E5 E7\n\nOccludin\n\nClaudin-5\n\n(a)\n\nIn\nte\n\ngr\nat\n\ned\n o\n\npt\nic\n\nal\n d\n\nen\nsit\n\ny \nof\n\nZO\n-1\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(b)\n\nIn\nte\n\ngr\nat\n\ned\n o\n\npt\nic\n\nal\n d\n\nen\nsit\n\ny \nof\n\ncla\nud\n\nin\n-5\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6\n\u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(c)\n\nIn\nte\n\ngr\nat\n\ned\n o\n\npt\nic\n\nal\n d\n\nen\nsit\n\ny \nof\n\noc\nclu\n\ndi\nn\n\nSham\nMCAO\nEA\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394\n\n\u2217\u0394 \u2217\u0394\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1,000\n\n1,200\n\n1,400\n\nSham\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\n\u0394\u22c6 \u0394\u22c6\n\n1d 3d 5d 7d\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 4: Effects of EA on the distribution and expression of ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin on ischemic cerebral microvessels.

Qi flows in a system of meridians\nand functions to warm the body and protect it from illness.\nBlood and qi are closely related. Blood nourishes the qi\nand offers a material foundation keeping qi in the correct\nlocation. Blood contains the spirit, which is significant for\nthe mental state. Yin and yang are two opposite sides of\nthe substance in traditional Chinese, and they will not exist\nwithout each other. When yin and yang are functioning\nharmoniously they maintain a dynamic balance, with no\nclinical symptoms. However, in pathological conditions, the\nbalance is interrupted.\n\nGV20 belongs to the governor vessel, which may connect\nall yang vessels in the whole body. GV20 functions to regulate\n\nlocal qi and blood and modulates the balance between yin\nand yang. After being stimulated, GV20 makes the normal\nfunction of the body active, dispersing local yang. ST36\nbelongs to the stomach meridian, which is rich in both qi\nand blood. Thus, it is supposed as an acupoint for its role\nin the recovery of paralysis. The combined use of the two\nacupoints is effective in dredging the channels and collaterals,\nmodifying the blood and qi and balancing yin and yang.\nEA therapy developed from traditional acupuncture, and\ncompared with traditional acupuncture EA adds electrical\nstimulation to acupoints.

To date, however, pharmacokinetic reports on cobra venoms and\ntheir toxins are still relatively limited. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of Naja sumatrana\n(Equatorial spitting cobra) venom and its major toxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin), following\nintravenous and intramuscular administration into rabbits.\n\nPrincipal findings: The serum antigen concentration-time profile of the N. sumatrana venom and its major toxins injected\nintravenously fitted a two-compartment model of pharmacokinetics. The systemic clearance (91.3 ml/h), terminal phase\nhalf-life (13.6 h) and systemic bioavailability (41.9%) of N. sumatrana venom injected intramuscularly were similar to those of\nN. sputatrix venom determined in an earlier study. The venom neurotoxin and cardiotoxin reached their peak concentrations\nwithin 30 min following intramuscular injection, relatively faster than the phospholipase A2 and whole venom (Tmax = 2 h\nand 1 h, respectively). Rapid absorption of the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin from the injection site into systemic circulation\nindicates fast onsets of action of these principal toxins that are responsible for the early systemic manifestation of\nenvenoming. The more prominent role of the neurotoxin in N. sumatrana systemic envenoming is further supported by its\nsignificantly higher intramuscular bioavailability (Fi.m. = 81.5%) compared to that of the phospholipase A2 (Fi.m. = 68.6%) or\ncardiotoxin (Fi.m. = 45.6%). The incomplete absorption of the phospholipase A2 and cardiotoxin may infer the toxins\u2019\naffinities for tissues at the injection site and their pathological roles in local tissue damages through synergistic interactions.\n\nConclusion/Significance: Our results suggest that the venom neurotoxin is absorbed very rapidly and has the highest\nbioavailability following intramuscular injection, supporting its role as the principal toxin in systemic envenoming.\n\nCitation: Yap MKK, Tan NH, Sim SM, Fung SY, Tan CH (2014) Pharmacokinetics of Naja sumatrana (Equatorial Spitting Cobra) Venom and Its Major Toxins in\nExperimentally Envenomed Rabbits.

In\n\nMalaysia, cobra bites appears to be one of the commonest causes\n\nof snake envenomation [4\u20136]. There are two species of common\n\ncobras in Malaysia: Naja kaouthia and Naja sumatrana, both classified\n\nas Category 1 medically important venomous snake [2]. Of these\n\ntwo Naja cobras, N. sumatrana is widely distributed in the Peninsula\n\nMalaysia (including Singapore), and is also known as the\n\nEquatorial spitting cobra [8], one of the venom-spitting species\n\nin Southeast Asia that are able to cause venom ophthalmia.\n\nClinically, cobra bites produce systemic envenomation syndrome\n\nwith the characteristic neuromuscular paralysis, and local toxicity\n\nmanifested as severe tissue necrosis [2,6,9]. The characterizations\n\nof different cobra venoms, however, are necessary for the better\n\nunderstanding of cobra envenomation pathophysiology as the\n\ntoxin compositions in cobra venoms vary from species to species\n\n[10]. Recent venom profiling with the use of ion-exchange high\n\nperformance liquid chromatography has shown that the major\n\ntoxins of N. sumatrana venom comprise high abundance of\n\nphospholipase A2 and three-finger toxins such as polypeptides of\n\nneurotoxins and cardiotoxins [10]. These are toxins with varied\n\nbiological and physicochemical properties which make the\n\ncharacterizations of individual toxins warranted in order to gain\n\nbetter insights into the toxic effects of the whole venom. The\n\noptimization of snakebite management and the use of antivenom\n\ndepend greatly on the knowledge of the venom\u2019s composition,\n\npharmacological activities, as well as its disposition in the body (i.e.\n\npharmacokinetics). The pathophysiological and pharmacological\n\neffects of snake envenomation are related to the absorption and\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002890&domain=pdf\n\n\ndistribution kinetics of venom toxins into the systemic circulation.\n\nIndeed, it has been reported that the serum concentrations of\n\nvenom antigens in snakebite victims are well correlated with the\n\nseverity of systemic and local symptoms during the course of\n\nenvenomation [11]. Although there have been some studies on the\n\npharmacokinetics of snake venoms or toxins in animals [12\u201322], the\n\nhighly varied snake venom compositions, inconsistent animal\n\nmodels, different pharmacokinetic modelling make the convergence\n\nof the data equivocal to have the pharmacokinetic parameters\n\ngeneralized across all snake species. To date, even within the Naja\n\ngenus of cobras, the pharmacokinetic studies on their venoms were\n\nlimited to isolated toxins of Formosan cobra [12,21], a few African\n\ncobra venoms and their alpha toxins [15] and N. sputatrix venom\n\n[22]. Information on the systemic bioavailability of cobra venoms\n\nand their toxins following envenomation is even scarcer in the\n\nliterature. There is therefore a need to define the pharmacokinetic\n\nparameters of specific cobra venom and its toxins more meticulously\n\nfor better clinical correlation.\n\nIn the present study, the pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana\n\nvenom and its three major types of toxins (neurotoxin, cardiotoxin\n\nand phospholipase A2) were investigated using double-sandwich\n\nELISA. This is the first report where the pharmacokinetics of a\n\ncobra venom was investigated alongside the pharmacokinetics of\n\nall its major types of toxins. The results will make it possible to\n\ninterpret the pharmacokinetics of the whole venom in the light of\n\nthat of its major toxins, and to enable better understanding of the\n\npathophysiological effects of the venom.\n\nMethods\n\nEthical statements\nAll experimental animals were handled in accordance to\n\nCIOMS guidelines on animal experimentation [23]. The exper-\n\nimental protocol on the animal study (2013-06-07/MOL/R/FSY)\n\nwas approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use\n\nCommittee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.\n\nVenom, reagents and separation media\nThe venom was a pooled sample obtained from three adult N.\n\nsumatrana captured in central Malaysia (Negeri Sembilan) and was\n\nsupplied by Snake Valley (Seremban, Malaysia).\n\nResource S ion exchange column and HiTrap Protein A HP\n\naffinity column were purchased from GE Healthcare (New Jersey,\n\nUSA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conju-\n\ngate was obtained from Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan. Lichrosphere\n\nWP 300 C18 reverse-phase column cartridge was purchased from\n\nMerck, New Jersey, USA. iBlot Gel Transfer stacks and iBlot\n\nblotting system were supplied by Invitrogen. Sephadex G-25 gel\n\nbeads and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma \u2013 Aldrich\n\n(St. Louis, USA) or as stated in the methods.\n\nAnimals\nThe animals used in this study (New Zealand white rabbits)\n\nwere supplied by Chenur Supplier (Selangor, Malaysia). The\n\nanimals were housed in Laboratory Animal Centre, Faculty of\n\nMedicine, University of Malaya, and received water and food ad\n\nlibitum.\n\nPurification of N. sumatrana toxins\nThe major N. sumatrana venom toxins (phospholipase A2,\n\nneurotoxin and cardiotoxin) were isolated from the venom by\n\nResource S ion-exchange chromatography as described by Yap et\n\nal., 2011 [10]. The isolated phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin (corresponds to peak 5, peak 7 and peak 8, respectively\n\nas reported in Yap et al., 2011 [10]) were further purified by C18\nreverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to\n\nhomogeneity on 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel\n\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel bands were subjected to in-\n\ngel tryptic digestion followed by protein identification using matrix\n\nassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/\n\nTOF) mass spectrometry, as described by Yap et al., 2011 [10].\n\nProduction of IgG antibodies against N. sumatrana\nvenom, venom phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and\ncardiotoxin\n\nPre-immune serum was collected and used as the control in\n\nELISA. In the first immunization, N. sumatrana venom (10 mg) or\nvenom toxins (neurotoxin, cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2,\n\nrespectively at 5 mg) dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2) and mixed with an\nequal volume of Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant, was injected\n\nintramuscularly into the thigh of the rabbits (n = 3 for each group).\n\nFor the subsequent immunizations, 20 mg of the venom or 10 mg\nof venom toxins were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2), respectively,\n\nmixed with an equal volume of Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant and\n\ninjected intramuscularly at multiple sites at the back of the rabbit\n\nfortnightly for 8 weeks. The immunogenicity and antibody titers of\n\ninocula were monitored using indirect ELISA as described by Yap\n\net al., 2011 [10]. The rabbits were bled by cardiac puncture 9 days\n\nafter the final immunization as indicated by plateauing of antibody\n\ntiter on indirect ELISA.\n\nPurification of IgG and preparation of horseradish\nperoxidase (HRP) conjugate\n\nAnti - N. sumatrana venom IgG and three anti-toxins IgG were\n\nisolated from rabbit sera (upon completion of immunization\n\nscheme) by Sephadex G-25 gel chromatography, followed by\n\nProtein A affinity chromatography [24]. The IgG-HRP conjugate\n\nwas prepared as described by Wisdom, 1996 [25].\n\nInvestigation of immunological cross-reactivity of N.\nsumatrana major venom toxins (phospholipase A2, PLA2;\nneurotoxin, NTX; cardiotoxin, CTX)\n\nIndirect ELISA for investigation of immunological cross-\n\nreactivity. ELISA immunoplate was coated with 100 ng/ml of\n\nvenom toxin (phospholipase A2, PLA2; neurotoxin, NTX or\n\ncardiotoxin, CTX) respectively and incubated overnight at 4uC.\nThe plates were washed with PBS-Tween and subsequently anti-\n\nPLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG or anti-CTX IgG (dilutions 1:200) was\n\nadded and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. This\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nNaja sumatrana is a medically important cobra species in\nSoutheast Asia. The optimization of snakebite manage-\nment and the use of antivenom depend greatly on the\nknowledge of the venom\u2019s composition, its biological\nactivities, as well as its pharmacokinetics. The present\nstudy on the pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom\nshows that the systemic bioavailability of this venom in\nexperimental envenomation is similar to N. sputatrix\nvenom determined in an earlier study. The neurotoxin\nand cardiotoxin exhibited a more rapid absorption and\nelimination compared to the phospholipase A2 and the\nwhole venom. The venom neurotoxin produced a higher\nsystemic bioavailability than the cardiotoxin and phos-\npholipase A2, suggesting that the neurotoxin plays the\nmajor toxic role in cobra bites.\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\nwas followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish\n\nperoxidase conjugate (dilutions of 1:6000) and 100 ml of substrate\no-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.4 mg/ml) for 1 h. The\n\nreaction was terminated by adding 50 ml sulfuric acid (12.5%).\nThe absorbance at 492 nm was then determined using Bio-Rad\n\nModel 690 microplate reader. The degree of cross-reactivity was\n\nexpressed in percentage (%) of absorbance.\n\nDouble-sandwich ELISA for investigation of immunological\n\ncross-reactivity. ELISA immunoplate was coated overnight at\n\n4uC with 100 ml of anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG, anti-CTX IgG\n(4 mg/ml), respectively. Plates were then incubated with 100 ml of the\nrespective venom toxins as antigens (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin,\n\ncardiotoxin) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. This was followed by\n\nincubation with 100 ml of anti-toxins IgG-HRP conjugate (1:400) for\n2 h, and 100 ml of substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride\n(0.4 mg/ml) was then added. The reaction was terminated after 1 h by\n\nadding 50 ml of 12.5% sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 492 nm\nwere then determined using Bio-Rad Model 690 microplate reader.\n\nThe degree of cross-reactivity was expressed in percentage (%) of\n\nabsorbance.\n\nSDS-PAGE and western blotting (immunoblotting). SDS-\n\nPAGE was conducted in an electrophoresis (slab) system according\n\nto the method described by Studier, 1973 [26] and a Fermentas\n\nSpectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder broad range SDS-\n\nPAGE standard was used for calibration. Ten micrograms of venom\n\ntoxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin or cardiotoxin) was electro-\n\nphoresed (15% gel) under reducing condition.\n\nThe proteins on the polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a\n\npolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (iBlot Gel Transfer\n\nstacks, PVDF, mini, Invitrogen) using iBlot blotting system\n\n(Invitrogen). The PVDF membrane was subsequently blocked wit\n\n2% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20. Anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-\n\nNTX IgG or anti-CTX IgG (dilution of 1:500 in TBS-Tween) was\n\nadded to the PVDF membrane followed by incubation with Goat\n\nanti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (dilutions of\n\n1:1000) for 1 h. The chromogenic detection of the protein bands on\n\nthe PVDF membrane was carried out by addition of the substrate\n\nsolution (Novex HRP Chromogenic Substrate (TMB), Invitrogen).\n\nDetermination of serum venom antigen and venom toxin\nantigen levels using double-sandwich ELISA\n\nDouble-sandwich ELISA was conducted as described previously\n\n[27]. It was used to monitor the serum venom antigen levels\n\nfollowing experimental envenomation in rabbits (n = 3) during\n\npharmacokinetic studies. Briefly, ELISA immunoplates were\n\ncoated overnight at 4uC with optimal coating concentration for\nvenom and venom toxins, which has been optimized as stated\n\nabove in the previous section (double-sandwich ELISA for\n\ninvestigation of immunological cross-reactivity). This was followed\n\nby subsequent incubation with 100 ml of diluted rabbit serum\nsamples (1:20) collected at different time intervals, 100 ml of anti-N.\nsumatrana venom IgG-HRP conjugate and anti-toxins IgG-HRP\n\nconjugate (dilution of 1:400) for 2 h. Substrate o-phenylenedi-\n\namine dihydrochloride (0.4 mg/ml) was added for colorimetric\n\ndevelopment and the absorbance at 492 nm was then determined\n\nusing Bio-Rad Model 690 microplate reader. A standard curve\n\nwas constructed using varying dilutions of venom or the respective\n\ntoxins in the spiked pre-envenomed sera.\n\nPharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom or toxins after\nintravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administrations\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom or toxins was\n\nstudied using rabbits (n = 3). A sub-lethal dose of the venom or\n\ntoxins was administered intravenously (i.v., marginal ear vein) or\n\nintramuscularly (i.m., quadriceps) into rabbits. Doses administered\n\nwere as follow: venom 0.5 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.);\n\nphospholipase A2 0.1 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.); neurotoxin\n\n0.07 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.); cardiotoxin 0.15 mg/kg\n\n(i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.). Blood samples were collected from\n\ncentral ear artery before experimental envenomation and at\n\nspecific time points (5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h and\n\n24 h) after venom injection. The collected blood samples were\n\ncentrifuged at 3,500 g for 20 min to obtain the sera, which were\n\nkept at -20uC until further analysis. The serum antigen concen-\ntrations were measured by double-sandwich ELISA as described\n\nabove using the pre-envenomed serum sample taken from the\n\nsame animal as the control for baseline reading.\n\nA parallel series of experiments were conducted to investigate\n\nthe pharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin in the whole venom when N.\n\nsumatrana venom was injected intravenously or intramuscularly\n\ninto the rabbits (n = 3). The serum concentrations of cardiotoxin\n\n(in the whole venom) at specified sampling times were estimated\n\nusing anti-CTX IgG on a double-sandwich ELISA, as described\n\nabove. The equivalent amounts of cardiotoxin in the injected\n\nwhole venom (0.1 mg/kg, i.v. or 0.5 mg/kg, i.m.) were estimated to\n\nbe 0.04 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, based on a 40% (by dry\n\nmass) composition of the whole venom [10]. This additional study\n\naimed to verify if the pharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin when\n\ninjected alone would be significantly different from that when\n\ninjected in its native environment (the whole venom).\n\nPharmacokinetic analysis\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of N. sumatrana venom and\n\nvenom toxins were determined using the method of feathering\n\n[28]. The initial phase rate constant (a) and terminal phase rate\nconstant (b) were determined from the slopes of the best-fit lines\nobtained for the initial phase and terminal phase, respectively, of\n\nthe log plasma concentration versus time plot. The initial phase\n\nhalf-life (T1/2a) and terminal phase half-life (T1/2 b) were\n\ndetermined by formula T1/2a or T1/2b = 0.693/a or b. The area\nunder the curve (AUC) was calculated from zero time to the last\n\nexperimental time point by trapezoidal rule and extrapolated to\n\ninfinity (AUC0-\u2018) according to the formula: AUC0-\u2018 = AUC0-t+\nCt/b, where t is the last experimental time point and Ct represents\nthe last serum venom concentration determined at time t.\n\nThe distribution rate constants for the transfer between central\n\ncompartment (designated as 1) and peripheral compartment\n\n(designated as 2) were calculated from the equations: k21 = (Ab\n+ Ba)/(A+B) and k12 = a+ b 2 k212 (ab/k21).\n\nThe other important pharmacokinetic parameters were deter-\n\nmined as follows:\n\nSystemic clearance, CL = dose (F)/AUC0-\u2018\nVolume of distribution by area, Vd,area = CL/b\nVolume of central compartment, Vc = Dosei.v./(A + B)\nVolume of peripheral compartment, Vp = k12/k21 (Vc)\n\nFi.v. is the intravenous bioavailability which is 1.\n\nFi.m. is the intramuscular bioavailability, and was calculated as\n\nfollows:\n\nFi:m~\nAUCi:m:\n\nAUCi:v:\n|\n\nDosei:v:\n\nDosei:m:\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are reported as the mean 6 S.D. or mean (95% C.I.).\n\nMann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences between\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 3 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\ntwo independent groups. Kruskal-Wallis H Test is the nonpara-\n\nmetric test for the comparison of more than two independent\n\ngroups. The level of significance was set at p,0.05. The statistical\n\nanalysis was conducted using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\n\nUSA).\n\nResults\n\nPharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom following\nintravenous administration\n\nThe serum concentration-time profiles of whole N. sumatrana\n\nvenom antigen following a single i.v. and i.m. administrations of\n\nvenom into rabbits (n = 3) are shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe i.v. serum concentration-time profile of N. sumatrana venom\n\n(0.1 mg/kg) (Figure 1, dotted line) showed a bi-exponential pattern\n\nwhich was best fitted to a two-compartment model of pharmaco-\n\nkinetics described by the equation Ct = Ae\n2at + Be2bt: where Ct\n\nrepresents the concentration at time, t; A and B represent the\n\nvenom concentrations at the zero time intercepts of the initial fast\n\nphase and terminal slow phase, respectively; while a and b\nrepresent the first-order disposition rate constants for the initial\n\nfast phase and the terminal phase, respectively.\n\nThe venom antigen level declined rapidly within the first 1 h\n\n(T1/2a = 0.8 6 0.3 h) during the initial phase followed by a much\n\nslower decline at the terminal phase (T1/2b = 13.661.1 h). The\n\nvolume of distribution by area (Vd,area) of the venom antigens in\n\nrabbits was 1.860.03 L, and the systemic clearance (CL) was\n\n91.367.8 ml/h, and the AUC0-\u2018 was 2201.26185.5 ng/ml.h.\n\nThe distribution rate constant for transfer from central to\n\nperipheral compartment (k12 = 0.460.2 h\n21) was comparable to\n\nthat from peripheral to central compartment (k21 = 0.560.2 h\n21;\n\np.0.05). Consequently, the volume of peripheral compartment\n\n(0.860.2 L) calculated based on the ratio of k constants was\n\ncomparable to that of central compartment (1.060.1 L).\n\nPharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom following\nintramuscular administration\n\nThe intramuscular administration of whole N. sumatrana venom\n\nin rabbits yielded a serum concentration-time profile (Figure 1,\n\nsolid line) with the absorption and distribution phase appeared\n\nindistinguishable. The venom antigen level peaked within 1 h at a\n\nconcentration (Cmax) of 391.7648.5 ng/ml. The terminal half-life\n\n(T1/2b = 12.560.9 h), volume of distribution by area (Vd,area\n= 1.760.1 L) and the systemic clearance (CL = 94.8612.7 ml/h) of\n\nthe venom antigen following i.m. injection were not significantly\n\ndifferent from that of i.v. pharmacokinetic parameters (p.0.05)\n\n(Table 1).\n\nThe AUC0-\u2018 of N. sumatrana venom when injected intramuscu-\n\nlarly (0.5 mg/kg) was 4617.86583.8 ng/ml.h. However, when\n\nadjusted to the intravenous venom dose (0.1 mg/kg), the\n\nnormalized AUC0-\u2018 of the venom antigens following i.m.\n\nadministration was 923.66116.8 ng/ml.h, which was significantly\n\nlower than the i.v. AUC0-\u2018 value (2201.26185.5 ng/ml.h;\n\np,0.05). The i.m. bioavailability (Fi.m.) calculated from the two\n\nAUC0-\u2018 values were 41.960.2%.\n\nImmunological cross-reactions of N. sumatrana venom\ntoxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin)\n\nThe phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin were\n\nisolated and purified from N. sumatrana venom.

These findings were supported by Western blot results\n\n(Figure 2): the anti-PLA2 IgG only reacted with the phospholipase\n\nA2 and neurotoxin, but not with cardiotoxin; and similarly, the\n\nanti-NTX IgG only reacted with the neurotoxin and phospholi-\n\npase A2, but not with cardiotoxin. Anti-CTX IgG reacted\n\nonly with cardiotoxin, but neither with phospholipase A2 nor\n\nneurotoxin. The neurotoxin appears to migrate to a higher\n\nposition than it should (i.e. in the same position as phospholipase\n\nA2) (Figure 2). To further examine this phenomenon, we\n\nperformed protein mass analysis and confirmed that the neuro-\n\ntoxin isolated is indeed short neurotoxin with a molecular mass of\n\n6.5 kDa (unpublished data).

Most of the pharmacoki-\n\nnetic parameters of the in-venom cardiotoxin were comparable\n\nwith values obtained when only purified cardiotoxin was\n\nadministered, with the major exceptions of a longer elimination\n\nhalf-life (T1/2b) and a lower clearance (CL) for the in-venom\n\ncardiotoxin (Table 5).\n\nDiscussion\n\nGenerally, the serum concentration-time profile of the venom/\n\ntoxin injected intravenously can be described by an open two-\n\ncompartment pharmacokinetic model where the venom or toxin is\n\ndistributed between the central and peripheral compartments. The\n\ndistribution half-life of N. sumatrana venom (T1/2a = 0.77 h) is\n\ncomparable to the value obtained for N. sputatrix venom in an\n\nearlier study (T1/2a = 0.5 h) [22], and to that for the African cobra\n\nvenoms (T1/2a = 22.2\u201330.5 min) [15] although a three\u2013compart-\n\nment pharmacokinetic model was applied in the latter case. The\n\nterminal half-life (T1/2b = 13.6 h) of N. sumatrana venom was not\n\nsignificantly different to that of N. sputatrix venom (T1/2b = 15.4 h)\n\n[22], indicating that the elimination of the venom antigens of these\n\ntwo Southeast Asian spitting cobras occurred at similar rate.\n\nThe volume of central compartment approximated 1 L for N.\n\nsumatrana venom, indicating that on intravenous administration,\n\nthe venom distributes rapidly and uniformly not only in the plasma\n\nof the animal (28\u201350 ml/kg for rabbit) but also in highly perfused\n\ntissues and interstitial fluids as well in view of its major content\n\nbeing water-soluble low molecular mass toxins (,10 kDa) which\n\nmay readily permeate the vascular endothelium [10]. As the ratio\n\nof the inter-compartmental transfer rate constants k12 and k21 for\n\nthe venom approximates unity (k12/k21 = 0.78), this means that at\n\nequilibrium (when inter-compartmental transfer rates are equal),\n\nthe amount of venom antigens in both the compartments do not\n\nvary significantly. This finding corroborates with that obtained in\n\nour earlier pharmacokinetic study of N. sputatrix venom (k12/\n\nk21 = 1) [22]. On the other hand, the large Vd,area of the venom\n\n(1.8 L, more than 10-fold of the total blood volume of a 2-kg\n\nrabbit) suggests that this cobra venom antigens distribute\n\nextensively to the peripheral or extra-vascular tissues. This seems\n\nto be a general phenomenon for venom antigens distribution in\n\nexperimentally envenomed animals [12,13,15]. Venom toxins that\n\nare distributed widely into the peripheral compartment may be\n\nassociated with the rebound phenomenon that sometimes occur\n\nduring antivenom therapy as rapid immunodepletion of venom\n\ntoxins in the blood favors the redistribution of venom antigens\n\nfrom the peripheral back into the central compartment [31,32].\n\nTo study the absorption of venom from the non-vascular\n\nparenteral administration site, the pharmacokinetics of N. suma-\n\ntrana venom was studied following an intramuscular administration\n\nof the venom (sub-lethal dose) into rabbits. The resulting serum\n\nvenom antigen concentration-time profile showed a relatively fast\n\nabsorption of some venom antigens within the first few minutes. A\n\nsubsequent short lag observed during the absorption phase of the\n\nvenom was probably due to the absorption of some venom\n\nantigens via the lymphatic route from the injection site into blood\n\ncirculation [20]. However, the serum concentration-time profile of\n\nthe intramuscularly injected whole venom yields apparently\n\nindistinguishable absorption and distribution phases of the various\n\ntoxins. The indistinguishable absorption and distribution phase\n\nreflects the continuous absorption of various antigenic venom\n\ncomponents that occur simultaneously with their respective\n\ndistribution phases. There was only one major serum concentra-\n\ntion peak seen at 1 h, presumably caused by the summated\n\nabsorption of a bulk of phospholipase A2 (Tmax,2 h) and the\nthree-finger toxins, i.e. neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (Tmax,K h)\ninto the systemic circulation occurring at a rate in close proximity\n\nwith each other. Rapid absorption of the venom with a short Tmax\ncorrelates with the fast onset of neurotoxic effect in cobra\n\nenvenoming, where the venom is known to exert direct inhibitory\n\naction on the neuromuscular junction via a postsynaptic blockade\n\n[33]. Administration of the venom by intramuscular route did not\n\nalter T1/2b, Vd,area and CL of the venom antigens. This indicates\n\nthat the elimination (and not the absorption) process is likely the\n\nrate-limiting step for the terminal phase of the pharmacokinetic\n\nprofile of intramuscularly injected venom.\n\nAs demonstrated from ion-exchange HPLC studies [10], N.\n\nsumatrana venom contains more neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (17%\n\nand 40%, respectively) compared to N. sputatrix venom (consists of\n\n8% neurotoxin and 35% cardiotoxin). However, N. sputatrix venom\n\nhas substantially greater amount (35%) of phospholipase A2 than\n\nN. sumatrana venom (28%). This may account for the somewhat\n\ngreater plasma clearance of N. sumatrana venom (91.3 ml/h)\n\ncompared to that of N. sputatrix venom (68.7 ml/h), since the\n\nsmaller three-finger toxins (more abundant in N. sumatrana venom)\n\nare cleared faster than the larger phospholipase A2 (more\n\nabundant in N. sputatrix venom), especially via the renal excretion\n\nroute.\n\nThe bioavailability of N. sumatrana venom following i.m. injection\n\nwas 41.9%, indicating incomplete absorption of the antigenic\n\nvenom components from the injection site into the systemic\n\ncirculation. This may be due to strong affinities of the cobra\n\nvenom toxins at the injection site [12,21], and this hypothesis\n\ncorrelates well with cobra venom\u2019s prominent toxic effect on local\n\ntissues that lasts for days to weeks [9,34\u201336]. The bioavailability of\n\nN. sumatrana venom (Fi.m.) was similar to that of N. sputatrix venom\n\n(Fi.m = 41.7%), which is a reflection of the fact that the cardiotoxin\n\nrepresents the bulk of both venoms (Fi.m. of cardiotoxin was 46%,\n\ndiscussed below).\n\nPharmacokinetics of the individual major toxins of N.\nsumatrana venom\n\nSince snake venom is a mixture of hundreds of proteins and\n\npeptides, it is therefore virtually impossible to investigate the\n\npharmacokinetics of each individual toxin when the whole venom\n\nwas administered into rabbits. As such, in this study, we only\n\nselected three representative toxins of N. sumatrana venom\n\n(neurotoxin, cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2) for pharmacoki-\n\nnetic investigations. These three toxins also represent the major\n\ntypes of toxins in the venom.\n\nIt should be noted that accurate quantitative measurement of\n\nindividual toxins in the serum of experimentally envenomed\n\nanimal using ELISA assay is not always feasible because of the\n\nimmunological cross-reactivities observed among the snake venom\n\ntoxins [37]. Indeed, our immunological cross-reaction studies\n\nrevealed extensive cross-reactivity between the phospholipase A2\nand polypeptide neurotoxin purified from N. sumatrana venom,\n\ndemonstrating that unrelated venom proteins of distinctive\n\nprimary structures and biological functions may share common\n\nantigenic domains [27,38]. As such, in the present report the\n\npharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom purified phospholipase\n\nA2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin was studied after intravenous or\n\nintramuscular injection of a sub-lethal dose of each toxin into\n\nrabbits. Double-sandwich ELISA was developed in which specific\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 9 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\nanti-toxin IgG\u2019s (i.e. anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG, anti-CTX\n\nIgG) were used to measure the serum toxin antigen levels following\n\ninjections of the individual toxins into rabbits.\n\nThe individual serum concentration-time profiles of the toxins,\n\nas with the whole venom, injected intravenously were also best\n\nfitted to an open two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, where\n\nthe toxins distributed between central and peripheral compart-\n\nments. Following intravenous administration, the individual toxins\n\ni.e. phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin demonstrated\n\nshorter distribution half-lives (0.56\u20130.66 h) compared to the whole\n\nvenom (0.93 h), reflecting a more rapid distribution of the purified\n\ntoxins on entering the systemic circulation.\n\nOn the other hand, unlike that observed for the whole venom,\n\nthere was no fluctuation pattern during the absorption and/or\n\ndistribution phase in the serum concentration-time profile of\n\nindividual toxins administered intramuscularly. The significant\n\ndifferences in the absorption of the whole venom and toxins were\n\nalso reflected by the time to reach peak concentration (Tmax). The\n\nneurotoxin and cardiotoxin antigens reached their respective peak\n\nconcentrations much faster than phospholipase A2, indicating fast\n\nabsorption of these two low molecular mass toxin molecules\n\n(approx. 8 kDa) from the injection site into the systemic\n\ncirculation. These principal cobra toxins are known to directly\n\ntarget receptors and cellular membranes, inducing rather rapid\n\ntissue responses compared to some viperid toxins the actions of\n\nwhich involve intermediate steps to accomplish the toxic effect, for\n\ninstance, coagulopathy secondary to defribrinogenation induced\n\nby thrombin-like enzymes [32]. The fast absorption of neurotoxin\n\nand cardiotoxin likely accounts for the rapid onset of the systemic\n\neffects upon cobra envenomation i.e. neuromuscular paralysis and\n\ncardiac complications [7,9,39]. In view of the rapid absorption of\n\nthese major toxins, meticulous monitoring for early institution of\n\nantivenom when indicated becomes crucial in order to alleviate\n\nthe severity of syndrome and to preempt fatal outcome.\n\nFurthermore, all the three toxins exhibited a large Vd,area (1.6\u2013\n\n2.2 L) which are .10 fold of the total blood volume of a rabbit,\n\nsuggesting that the toxin antigens distributed extensively into the\n\nperipheral tissues. This finding is congruent with the large volume\n\nof distribution of the whole venom in rabbits as described above.\n\nBoth the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (2.0\u20132.2 L) showed a larger\n\nVd,area compared to the phospholipase A2 (1.4 L), and this may be\n\nbecause low molecular mass proteins like neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin (with molecular mass of approximately 7\u20138 kDa) cross\n\nthe capillary endothelium more easily than do the larger proteins\n\n[13] such as phospholipase A2 (16 kDa).\n\nIn this study, the terminal half-lives (T1/2b) of neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin were similar (8.6\u20138.8 h) but shorter than that of\n\nphospholipases A2 (11.7 h). This finding is consistently reflected in\n\nthe systemic clearance of the three toxins, where the clearance\n\nvalues of neurotoxin and cardiotoxin were significantly larger\n\n(indicative of faster elimination) than that of phospholipase A2.\n\nAssuming that the elimination takes place primarily from the\n\ncentral compartment and probably via the renal excretion route,\n\nthe faster clearance of neurotoxin and cardiotoxin can be\n\nexplained by the higher vascular permeability of the two toxins\n\nas both are low molecular mass peptides. However, the T1/2b\nvalues for the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin determined in this study\n\nare substantially different from the terminal half-lives of African\n\ncobras\u2019 a-neurotoxin (15\u201329 h, in rabbits) [15] and that of\ncytotoxin from Chinese cobra, Naja naja atra (3.5 h, in rabbits)\n\n[12], suggesting intrageneric variations in the pharmacokinetics of\n\nthese cobra three-finger toxins.\n\nAmong the three major toxins, N. sumatrana neurotoxin has the\n\nmost complete systemic absorption from the injection site, as\n\nevidenced by its higher intramuscular bioavailability\n\n(Fi.m. = 81.5%) than that of phospholipase A2 (68.6%) and\n\ncardiotoxin (45.6%). This is in agreement with the finding of\n\nIsmail et al. (1998) [16], who reported a bioavailability of 88% for\n\nWalterinnesia aegyptia a-neurotoxin. Interestingly, the Fi.m. of\ncardiotoxin was only 45.6%, presumably due to the strong\n\nbinding affinity of cardiotoxin to the tissues at the injection site\n\nresulting in a poor absorption of cardiotoxin into the systemic\n\ncirculation. On the other hand, the Fi.m. of the phospholipase A2\nwas 68.6%, indicating that a substantial amount of the toxin\n\nremained at the injection site. Indeed, bites from N. sumatrana (and\n\nmost Naja cobras) can produce local envenomation characterized\n\nby local tissue necrosis involving the cutaneous, muscular and\n\nconnective tissue layers [2,9,34,40,41]. Cardiotoxin and phospho-\n\nlipase A2 have been reported to interact synergistically and possess\n\npotent cytolytic activity [42,43], and their substantial unabsorbed\n\namount at the injection site seem to suggest that their toxic effects\n\nplay an important role in local envenoming, which consequences\n\ninclude tissue necrosis following cobra bites, as well as venom\n\nophthalmia in venom-spitted victims [44].\n\nAlthough the i.v. pharmacokinetic behavior of neurotoxin is\n\nsimilar to that of cardiotoxin (particularly in having a rapid\n\nabsorption with a short Tmax), their intramuscular bioavailabilities\n\ndiffered markedly. The relatively low bioavailability of cardiotoxin\n\nwould suggest that the systemic effects of cardiotoxin may not be\n\nthat prominent in cobra envenomation, even though the venom\n\ncontains relatively large amount of cardiotoxins (40% of venom\n\ncontent [10]). Furthermore, the neurotoxin is known to be much\n\nmore lethal than both the cardiotoxin and phospholipases A2, with\n\nan approximate 10-fold lower LD50 in mice (0.1 mg/g, [34]). It\nbelongs to a-neurotoxins with high intrinsic activity of inhibiting\nthe motor endplate nicotinic receptors vis-a\u0300-vis that of cardiotoxins\n\nand phospolipases A2, the target receptors of which are primarily\n\ndifferent and their actions are not crucial in mediating neuromus-\n\ncular paralysis - the central cobra envenoming feature that leads to\n\nrapid death [34]. This is consistent with clinical reports where\n\nrapid onset of neuromuscular paralysis (caused by neurotoxins) is\n\nthe most common fatal manifestation of systemic cobra enven-\n\nomation, where victims may succumb to respiratory failure and\n\ndeath ensues within minutes to hours [9,36,45]. The pharmaco-\n\nkinetic result in addition to the neuromuscular blockade activity of\n\nneurotoxin generally supports the hypothesis that the neurotoxin\n\nplays the principal role in systemic envenomation of N. sumatrana,\n\nand should be one of the most crucial toxins to be targeted by\n\nantivenom. Nevertheless, variations of neurotoxins across cobra\n\nspecies have been reported on their structures and activities, and\n\nthe phenomenon is likely the clue to varied efficacies of\n\ncommercially available antivenoms in the cross-neutralization of\n\ncobra venoms in the region [46]. The pharmacokinetic profiling\n\nmethod hence appears useful in validating the toxin\u2019s role from the\n\npharmacokinetic aspect, and may be further utilized as a tool in\n\nassessing antivenom efficacy on the targeted toxin derived from\n\ndifferent cobras.\n\nPharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin following intravenous or\nintramuscular administrations of whole N. sumatrana\nvenom\n\nIn view of the negligible immunological cross-reactivity between\n\ncardiotoxin with phospholipase A2 and neurotoxin, it is possible to\n\naccurately determine the serum concentration of cardiotoxin\n\nfollowing intravenous or intramuscular administration of the\n\nwhole N. sumatrana venom using the same double-sandwich ELISA\n\ndeveloped. This study would help to shed light on whether the\n\npharmacokinetics of an individual toxin could be altered by other\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 10 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\nvenom constituents, and whether the information gathered from\n\nthe pharmacokinetic study of individual toxins can be applied in\n\nsituations where the whole venom was injected.\n\nThe serum concentration-time profile of cardiotoxin when whole\n\nvenom was injected was found to be similar to that when only\n\npurified cardiotoxin was injected (Figure 3C and 3D). It is however\n\nnoted that when whole venom was injected, cardiotoxin exhibited a\n\nlonger T1/2b and a lower CL than when only cardiotoxin was\n\ninjected. The results therefore suggest that the rate of elimination of\n\ncardiotoxin in the whole venom is likely affected by the presence of\n\nother venom components in the venom due to competition among\n\nvarious venom components for the elimination processes. The\n\nresults reflect that in N. sumatrana envenomation, pharmacokinetic\n\ncharacteristics of individual major toxins can be largely applied to\n\nsituations where the whole venom is injected, with the possible\n\nexception that the rate of elimination of the toxins determined may\n\nbe higher than that of the whole venom. On the other hand, the\n\nintramuscular bioavailability (Fi.m) of cardiotoxin injected with\n\nwhole venom (39.5%) was similarly low, if not even lower,\n\ncompared to the Fi.m. of cardiotoxin when only the toxin was\n\nadministered (45.6%), consistent with the indication that cardio-\n\ntoxin remained substantially unabsorbed at the injection tissue site.\n\nConclusions\nIn general, the elimination half-life of the whole venom is\n\ndetermined by the toxic components with the longest T1/2b\n\n(phospholipase A2 in the case of N. sumatrana venom), while its\n\nintramuscular bioavailability is influenced more by the toxic\n\ncomponents that is present most abundantly in the venom\n\n(cardiotoxin, in this case). In the present pharmacokinetic study\n\nof N. sumatrana venom and toxins, both the neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin were rapidly absorbed intramuscularly in the rabbits,\n\nwith neurotoxin achieving the highest systemic bioavailability,\n\nwhile the cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2 possess relatively\n\nlower bioavailabilities. These pharmacokinetic findings therefore\n\nsuggest that the neurotoxin is the principal toxin in systemic\n\nenvenomation (fatal neuromuscular paralysis), while significant\n\namounts of the cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2 remain bound to\n\nthe injection site, causing local tissue destruction. Using toxin-\n\nspecific ELISA, the study also shows that the cobra venom\n\npharmacokinetics is likely an approximation of the pharmacoki-\n\nnetics of individual toxins except for parameters relating to\n\nelimination rate due to possible competition of various toxins for\n\nthe process in vivo.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: NHT SMS SYF.

The conformational state of the translocated substrates within the bacterial cell is\nunknown, so we sought to determine if folded substrates could be translocated via this system. Fusions of L. pneumophila Icm/\nDot-translocated substrates (IDTS) to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or ubiquitin (Ub), small proteins known to fold rapidly,\nresulted in proteins with low translocation efficiencies. The folded moieties did not cause increased aggregation of the IDTS and\ndid not impede interaction with the adaptor protein complex IcmS/IcmW, which is thought to form a soluble complex that pro-\nmotes translocation. The translocation defect was alleviated with a Ub moiety harboring mutations known to destabilize its\nstructure, indicating that unfolded proteins are preferred substrates. Real-time analysis of translocation, following movement\nduring the first 30 min after bacterial contact with host cells, revealed that the folded moiety caused a kinetic defect in IDTS\ntranslocation. Expression of an IDTS fused to a folded moiety interfered with the translocation of other IDTS, consistent with it\ncausing a blockage of the translocation channel. Furthermore, the folded protein fusions also interfered with intracellular\ngrowth, consistent with inefficient or impaired translocation of proteins critical for L. pneumophila intracellular growth. These\nstudies indicate that substrates of the Icm/Dot T4SS are translocated to the host cytosol in an unfolded conformation and that\nfolded proteins are stalled within the translocation channel, impairing the function of the secretion system.\n\nLegionella pneumophila is a pathogen of amoebae that grows inan intravacuolar niche in these cells (1\u20134). Upon aerosol-\nization of contaminated water supplies, inhalation of L. pneu-\nmophila and subsequent internalization by alveolar macro-\nphages lead to disease (2, 5, 6). The bacterium replicates within\na membrane-bound vacuole in macrophages that is identical to\nthe replication compartment found in amoebae (7). Formation\nof the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) requires a func-\ntional type IV secretion system (T4SS) known as the Icm/Dot\ncomplex (8, 9), which transports a massive collection of effec-\ntors into the host cytosol. To date, over 275 of these protein\nsubstrates have been identified (10\u201319). Shortly after internal-\nization of the bacteria into either macrophages or amoebae,\nmitochondria and markers of the endoplasmic reticulum are\nrecruited to the LCV to establish a vacuole that allows replica-\ntion before the cell lyses, releasing bacteria into the extracellu-\nlar milieu for a second round of infection (20\u201322).\n\nType IV secretion systems (T4SS) are utilized by a wide variety\nof Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to translocate effec-\ntor molecules across the bacterial membrane. This diverse group\nof secretion complexes is defined by ancestral relatedness to bac-\nterial conjugation machines that are able to translocate nucleic\nacids, proteins, and nucleoprotein complexes (23\u201326). T4SS can\nbe broadly classified into two subgroups based on similarity to the\narchetypal Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 (VirB/D4)\ncomplex (24). Type IVA systems (T4ASS) share significant simi-\nlarity to the VirB/D4 system and can be found in pathogens such\nas Helicobacter pylori and Brucella abortus (24, 25). The type IVB\nsystems (T4BSS) are distinct from the VirB/D4 system and are best\nrepresented by Legionella species and Coxiella burnetii (24, 25, 27,\n28). Although sequence similarities may be limited between the\nT4ASS and T4BSS members, there is evidence for functional con-\nservation between these two subclasses as both appear to have core\n\nprotein components that form a complex spanning the inner and\nouter membranes of Gram-negative organisms (29\u201331). In addi-\ntion, each has a coupling ATPase complex, which is thought to act\nas a receptor for translocated substrates, transferring them to\nother components of the secretion system as a first step in transit\nto target cells (32).\n\nIn L. pneumophila, the earliest steps in the translocation pro-\ncess involve interactions between the Icm/Dot-translocated sub-\nstrate (IDTS) and the IcmS/IcmW chaperone (33, 34), which is a\nsoluble heteromeric component of the (IcmS/W) apparatus. As\nIcmS/W associates with the coupling ATPase complex DotL/\nDotM/DotN, it is likely that this five-member multiprotein com-\nplex presents translocated substrates to core secretion system\ncomponents that span the bacterial envelope. Inactivating muta-\ntions in IcmS or IcmW result in highly reduced efficiencies of\ntranslocation of most IDTSs although a subset appears to translo-\ncate into host cells independently of this chaperone. It is likely that\nstructural determinants control the dependence on IcmS/W for\ntranslocation of a protein and that IDTSs are capable of interact-\ning directly with the secretion system in the absence of the chap-\nerone. The critical components of the translocated substrates that\nallow Icm/Dot recognition are still somewhat obscure although it\nis clear that each IDTS contains a carboxyl-terminal signal of less\n\nReceived 2 May 2013 Returned for modification 2 June 2013\nAccepted 13 June 2013\n\nPublished ahead of print 24 June 2013\n\nEditor: A.

Both short polar amino acids and a glutamate-rich\nregion appear to be common sequence determinants for this sig-\nnal (13, 19, 35). The proteins that recognize this signal and target\nthe protein to the complex are not known.\n\nIn many secretion systems, there are determinants other than\nthe recognition signal that are required for successful movement\nthrough the membrane. In Escherichia coli, chimeric proteins that\nfused secretion signal sequences onto normally cytoplasmic pro-\nteins resulted in \u201cjamming\u201d of the secretion apparatus, presum-\nably by entry of an impassable substrate into the secretion channel\n(36). Similarly, translocation of proteins from the cytosol into\nmitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes can all be blocked by\nintroduction of tightly folded protein moieties into coding se-\nquences, consistent with there being a secretion-competent con-\nformation required for translocation (37\u201339). The necessity of a\nsecretion-competent conformation, however, does not appear ev-\nident in many systems, such as the bacterial twin-arginine trans-\nlocation (Tat) pathway and the eukaryotic peroxisomal import\npathway, in which the insertion of folded domains has no effect on\ntranslocation (40\u201342).\n\nSpecialized bacterial secretion systems that deliver proteins to\ntarget cells provide a very special problem for maintaining a secre-\ntion-competent conformation. The translocated substrates of\nthese systems are often synthesized and stored prior to contact of\nbacteria with their secretion targets, and a large bolus of protein\nmust be injected via these systems quickly. In spite of these issues,\nthere is evidence that a tightly folded moiety interferes with trans-\nlocation of type III secretion substrates, either because it is rejected\nby the complex or jams the apparatus (43, 44). There is also some\nevidence that in the case of some proteins, the secretion apparatus\nitself can unfold a substrate, converting a nontranslocatable form\ninto a secretion-competent conformation (45, 46). In contrast,\nlittle is known regarding the tertiary structure of T4SS substrates,\nand structural analysis of the T4ASS core complex does not nec-\nessarily demand that substrates be unfolded prior to entering into\nthe channel (30, 47). In this study, we investigate whether the L.\npneumophila Icm/Dot system can tolerate substrates containing\ndomains known to poison secretion by other translocation appa-\nratuses. The results obtained are consistent with the presence of\nconformational states that interfere with efficient translocation.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains, plasmids, and cell culture. All bacterial strains and\nplasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. All PCR primers used in\nthis work are available from the authors. Growth medium for L. pneumo-\nphila was as described previously (8, 48). For L. pneumophila, chloram-\nphenicol was used at a concentration of 20 \ufffdg/ml. For E. coli strains,\nantibiotics were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 40 \ufffdg/\nml; ampicillin, 100 \ufffdg/ml; and chloramphenicol, 30 \ufffdg/ml.\n\nL. pneumophila strain Lp02 (thyA-hsdR rpsL) (49), a thymine (Thy)-\nauxotrophic derivative of the Philadelphia-1 isolate, was used as the wild\ntype in experiments. Lp03 (Lp02 dotA03) was used as a translocation-\ndeficient control where indicated (49). The icmS deletion mutant (Lp02\n\ufffdicmS) was generated as previously described (50).\n\nAll CyaA fusions were constructed by cloning IDTS open reading frames\n(ORFs) into pJB2581 (51). Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusions were\nconstructed by inserting the coding sequence of Mus musculus dhfr (GenBank\nNM_010049.3) into pJB2581, in between the cyaA and IDTS sequences unless\notherwise indicated. Fusions were generated using splicing by overlap exten-\nsion PCR (SOE-PCR). Ubiquitin fusions were constructed similarly to those\n\nwith DHFR, using the 67-amino-acid monomer of ubi4p from Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae S288c (NM_001181859.1). FLAG-tagged fusions were constructed\nby adding FLAG sequence (ATG-GATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG)\nto the amino terminus of IDTS ORFs by PCR and cloning into pJB908.\nThe glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IcmS/IcmW plasmid (pJB5809) was\na generous gift of J. Vogel, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.\n\nThe U937 cell line (ATCC CRL-1593.2) was passaged and differenti-\nated as described previously (8). HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-11268) were\ngrown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 4.5g/\nliter D-glucose (catalog number 11995; Invitrogen-Gibco) supplemented\nwith 10% heat-inactivated HyClone fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo\nScientific). Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were\nprepared from the femurs of female A/J mice (Jackson Laboratories) ac-\ncording to a previously published protocol (52) and cultivated in RPMI\n1640 medium supplemented with glutamate (Invitrogen-Gibco) and 10%\nheat-inactivated FBS (Gibco). All manipulations with animals were ap-\nproved by the Tufts University IACUC, and the research approach was\napproved the Tufts University Institutional Biosafety Review Board.\n\nCyaA translocation assay. Translocation assays using CyaA protein\nfusions were adapted from previous protocols (51). Unless otherwise in-\ndicated, L. pneumophila was grown overnight in AYE [N-(2-acetamido)-\n2-aminoethanesulfonic acid-buffered yeast extract] broth with appropri-\nate additives to exponential phase (A600 of \ufffd2.2 to 2.4, with less than 10%\nof the bacteria motile). CyaA protein expression was induced with 200\n\ufffdM isopropyl-\ufffd-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated for an\nadditional 3 to 5 h until late exponential phase (A600 \ufffd3.2 to 3.6 with more\nthan 50% motility). A total of 2.5 \ufffd 106 phorbol ester-differentiated U937\ncells were incubated in 24-well plates and challenged with L. pneumophila\nstrains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After a 1-h incubation\nwith bacteria (unless otherwise indicated), U937 cells were washed three\ntimes with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and extracts were pre-\npared by the addition of 200 \ufffdl of lysis buffer (50 mM HCl, 0.1% Triton\nX-100) and incubation on ice for 10 min. Lysates were collected, boiled for\n5 min, and then neutralized by the addition of 12 \ufffdl of 0.5 M NaOH.\nProtein was precipitated by adding 400 \ufffdl of cold 95% ethanol (EtOH)\nand incubated at \ufffd20\u00b0C for at least 5 min. Insoluble material was removed\nby centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were dried and\nresuspended in assay buffer, and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration\nwas measured in extracts diluted 1:500 using a GE Healthcare Life Sci-\nences Biotrak cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit\n(RPN225). Data were normalized to the amount of the housekeeping\nprotein isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) or the Icm/Dot system protein\nDotF to determine bacterial load, and data were expressed as a ratio of the\ncyclase reaction rate relative to the steady-state levels of CyaA reporter\nfusions in each well, as determined by Western blotting of bacterial ly-\nsates. Data are presented as fmol/well/[fusion protein].\n\nAntibodies used in this work. For detection of cyclase fusions by\nWestern blotting probing, anti-CyaA (3D1) mouse monoclonal IgG\n(Santa Cruz) was used at a concentration of 1:15,000 diluted in 5% milk\nwith a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\nsecondary antibody used at a concentration of 1:10,000. For detection\nusing the FLA-9000 developer, anti-CyaA was used at a concentration of\n1:5,000 diluted in NAP (non-animal protein) Blocker (GBiosciences)\nwith a Cy5-goat anti-mouse IgG at a concentration of 1:10,000 or Cy3-\ngoat anti-mouse IgG at a concentration of 1:5,000 (Invitrogen). Serum\nspecific for Bacillus subtilis isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) was gener-\nously provided by A. L. Sonenshein, Tufts University Medical School,\nBoston, MA.\n\nReal-time assay of translocation rate. A GloSensor cAMP assay\n(TM076; Promega) was adapted for the real-time analysis of translocation\nusing L. pneumophila harboring CyaA fusions. Two days prior to infec-\ntion, 293T cells were resuspended at a density of 1.5 \ufffd 105 cells/ml in a\nsolid white 96-well plate (Costar 3917) and incubated overnight. The next\nday, cells were transfected with pGloSensor20F cAMP plasmid (E1171;\nPromega) at a concentration of 12.5 ng/\ufffdl, as well as with a plasmid\n\nAmyot et al.\n\n3240 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nexpressing Fc\ufffdRIIA at a concentration of 18.75 ng/\ufffdl, using FuGENE HD,\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 24 h of incubation, the\nmedium was carefully removed from the 293T cells and replaced with 200\n\ufffdl of GloSensor cAMP reagent (E1290; Promega) equilibration medium\n(88% CO2-independent medium [Invitrogen 18045], 10% FBS, 2 to 3%\n[vol/vol] freshly thawed cAMP reagent) supplemented with 100 \ufffdg/ml\nthymidine and 200 \ufffdM IPTG, as necessary. The cells were incubated for 1\nh further at 37\u00b0C prior to challenge at an MOI of 10 with bacteria that were\ndiluted in opsonizing medium (CO2-independent medium, 10% FBS, 100\n\ufffdg/ml Thy, 200 \ufffdM IPTG, and anti-Legionella antibody [1:1,000]). The\nwells containing the opsonized bacteria were subjected to 5 min of cen-\ntrifugation at 1,000 rpm and immediately placed in a luminescence plate\nreader preheated to 37\u00b0C. Luminescence measurements were taken every\n\n2 min for up to 1 h. As a positive control, forskolin, an activator of adenylyl\ncyclase, was added at a concentration of 10 \ufffdM. Data were recorded as\nrelative light units, after the subtraction of background from wells that\nwere not incubated with the cAMP reagent.\n\nDetermination of DHFR enzymatic activity. DHFR activity of the\nCyaA-IDTS fusions was measured with a colorimetric assay based on the\nNADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic\nacid. For measurement of DHFR activity, 100-ml overnight cultures of L.\npneumophila expressing IDTS fusions to murine DHFR were pelleted,\nresuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM\nEDTA, 50 \ufffdg/ml DNase, 200 \ufffdg/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitor cocktail\n[Roche]), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were lysed by three\nfreeze-thaw cycles, alternating 1- to 2-min incubations in liquid nitrogen,\n\nTABLE 1 Strains and plasmids used in this study\n\nStrain or plasmid Genotype or relevant characteristic(s)a Oligonucleotide(s)\nReference\nor source\n\nStrains\nL. pneumophila\n\nLp01 Philadelphia-1 rpsL hsdR 8\nLp02 Philadelphia-1 rpsL hsdR thyA mutant 8\nLp03 Lp02 dotA03 8\nLp02 \ufffdicmS 62\n\nE. coli\nDH5\ufffd \t\ufffd \n80dlacZ\ufffdM15 \ufffd(lacZYA-argF)U169 recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rK\n\n\ufffd mK\n\ufffd)\n\nsupE44 thi-1 gyrA relA1\nPlasmids\n\npJB908 pMMB66EH oriRSF1010 oriT bla td\ufffdi 66\npJB2581 cyaA in pJB908-td\ufffdi, Cmr 49\npCyaA-DHFR pJB2581 dhfr\ufffd 35, 36 This study\npCyaA-MavU pJB2581 mavU 63, 58 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU pCyaA dhfr mavU 63, 64, 65, 58 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C50) pJB2581 mavU(348-end) 44, 45 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C50) pCyaA dhfr mavU(348-end) 44, 45 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C186) pJB2581 mavU(212-end) This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C186) pCyaA dhfr mavU(212-end) 63, 58, 71, 72 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C118) pJB2581 mavU(280-end) This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C118) pCyaA dhfr mavU(280-end) 63, 58, 73, 74 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C78) pJB2581 mavU(320-end) This study\npCyaA-DHFR-Mavu(C78) pCyaA dhfr mavU(320-end) 64, 58, 75, 76 This study\npMavU pJB908 mavU 99, 58 This study\npCyaA-SidG pJB2581 sidG 60, 54b This study\npCyaA-DHFR-SidG pCyaA dhfr sidG 60, 54b This study\npJB-CyaA-RalF pJB2581 ralF 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-RalF pCyaA dhfr ralF 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-LidA pJB2581 lidA 25, 31 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-LidA pCyaA dhfr lidA 25, 31, 17, 18, 20, 21 This study\npCyaA-SidC pJB2581 sidC 7, 10 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-SidC pCyaA dhfr sidC 7, 10 This study\npCyaA-VIpD pJB2581 vipD 22, 24 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-VipD pCyaA dhfr vipD 22, 24 This study\npCyaA-Ub pJB2581 ubi4p 93, 95 This study\npCyaA-Ub(G3,13) pJB2581 ubi4p(G3,13) 94, 95 This study\npCyaA-Ub-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p ralF 93, 95, 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-Ub(G3,13)-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p(G3,13) ralF 94, 95, 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-Ub(V76)-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p(V76) ralF 108, 95 This study\npFLAG-SidG pJB908 FLAG-sidG 104b, 43 This study\npFLAG-SidG(Cterm) pJB908 FLAG-sidG(936-end) 43 This study\npFLAG-MavU pJB908 FLAG-mavU 110 This study\npFLAG-RalF pJB908 FLAG-ralF 109 This study\npJB5809 pGST-IcmS/W J.

Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at\n15,000 \ufffd g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Total protein in the extracts was quantified\nusing a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to standard protocols.\n\nFor each reaction, 100 \ufffdl of protein extracts (0.5 to 1.0 mg of total\nprotein) was incubated in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM\nNaCl, 5 mM \ufffd-mercaptoethanol) containing 100 \ufffdM \ufffd-2=-NADPH\n(Sigma) and 100 \ufffdM dihydrofolic acid (Sigma).

Samples were lysed by three freeze-thaw\ncycles, alternating 1 to 2 min incubations in liquid nitrogen, and a 37\u00b0C\nwater bath. In both lysed and unlysed samples, cell debris was cleared by\ncentrifugation at 15,000 \ufffd g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. For the reaction mixture,\n100 \ufffdl of supernatant was mixed with 1 mM ATP in 50 mM Tris and 50\n\ufffdM CaCl2; 10 \ufffdM calmodulin (CaM) was added to each tube, and reac-\ntion mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 to 30 min before reactions were\nstopped with 2\ufffd stop buffer (100 \ufffdM HCl\u2013 0.2% Triton X-100) and\nboiling for 5 min, followed by neutralization with 12 \ufffdl of 0.5 M NaOH.\nProtein was precipitated with 400 \ufffdl of ice-cold 95% EtOH and incubated\nat \ufffd20\u00b0C for at least 5 min. Extracts were dried under vacuum and mixed\nwith assay buffer, and cAMP concentration was measured as for all cyclase\nassays. Data were normalized to the expression of CyaA fusions as deter-\nmined by steady-state levels of lysates on a Western blot and displayed as\nfmol/[fusion protein].\n\nQuantification of protein aggregation. Overnight cultures of L. pneu-\nmophila harboring fusion proteins were grown as for cyclase assays. A\ntotal of 2.5 \ufffd 109 bacteria were pelleted at 10,000 \ufffd g for 5 min, resus-\npended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA [pH\n8.0], 50 \ufffdg/ml DNase, 200 \ufffdg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitor cock-\ntail [Roche]), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were lysed as\ndescribed for bacterial cyclase assays. Cellular debris was separated by a\nslow centrifugation at 3,000 \ufffd g for 1 min. The pellets were resuspended in\n500 \ufffdl 2\ufffd sample buffer and saved. Total protein samples were obtained\nby mixing 80 \ufffdl of supernatant with 20 \ufffdl of 5\ufffd sample buffer. To pre-\ncipitate proteins, 800 \ufffdl of supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at\n\ufffd100,000 \ufffd g for 1 h. Pellets (aggregated proteins) were resuspended in\n400 \ufffdl of 2\ufffd sample buffer, and 160 \ufffdl of supernatant was mixed with 40\n\ufffdl of 5\ufffd sample buffer. All samples were boiled, and the equivalent of\n2.5 \ufffd 107 cells for each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE. CyaA-IDTS\nprotein in each sample was detected using antibody against CyaA and\nquantified by densitometry. Percent aggregation was expressed as the\namount of protein in the pellet fractions relative to the total protein.\n\nCopurification of the IDTS and IcmS/W complex. E. coli DH5\ufffd was\ntransformed with the plasmid pJB5809, encoding GST-IcmS-IcmW (J.\nVogel, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and a second plasmid that\nencodes a FLAG-tagged IDTS. A plasmid expressing GST without IcmS/\nIcmW was used as a control. Overnight cultures (500 ml) were grown in\nLB medium supplemented with kanamycin and carbenicillin. Protein ex-\npression was induced by the addition of 0.5 M IPTG, and cells were incu-\n\nbated at 30\u00b0C for 3 h with slow shaking. Cultures were harvested by cen-\ntrifugation at 10,000 \ufffd g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended\nin 10 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 50 \ufffdg/ml DNase, 1 mM dithio-\nthreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), followed by lys-\ning with a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at\n15,000 \ufffd g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, and cleared lysates were incubated with 0.5\nml of glutathione beads for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Columns were washed three times\nwith cold wash buffer (PBS [pH 7.4], 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and\nprotease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Bound GST-IcmS/IcmW and asso-\nciated proteins were eluted with four 0.75-ml aliquots of 10 mM reduced\nglutathione in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). Elutions were combined and con-\ncentrated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. All fractions were\nmixed with 2\ufffd sample buffer and probed after Western blotting, with\neluate fractions enriched 20\ufffd.\n\nTranslocation assayed by bacterial fractionation. Differentiated\nU937 cells were plated in a six-well tissue culture dish at a density of 1.5 \ufffd\n107 cells/well. L. pneumophila strains were cultured as for other transloca-\ntion assays and used to challenge U937 cells at an MOI of 5. After 1.5 h,\nwells were washed three times with warm medium to remove nonassoci-\nated bacteria. Cells were lifted by pipetting up and down in 2 to 3 ml of\nPBS, pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 rpm, resuspended in 200\n\ufffdl of PBS containing 0.5% digitonin and protease inhibitor cocktail\n(Roche), and incubated for 20 min with rotation at room temperature.\nThe detergent lysate was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15\nmin at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant, representing the detergent soluble fraction, was\nmixed with 5\ufffd sample buffer and boiled. Pellets were further solubilized\nin 2% SDS and mixed with 2\ufffd sample buffer.\n\nIntracellular growth assay. Bone marrow-derived macrophages\n(BMDM) from A/J mice were replated on glass coverslips in a 24-well\nplate at 2 \ufffd 105 cells per well. Postexponential phase L. pneumophila was\nused to challenge cells at an MOI of 1, and plates were subjected to cen-\ntrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 rpm to promote bacterial association with\ncells. After 2 h, cells were washed with RPMI medium, and growth was\nallowed to proceed for an additional 12 h. Coverslips were washed in PBS,\nfixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and blocked in 4% goat serum\nin PBS. After samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, bac-\nteria were stained by anti-L. pneumophila rat serum and secondary anti-\nrat Texas Red (1:500) (Invitrogen). The number of intracellular bacteria\nin individual phagosomes was counted by visual inspection under a mi-\ncroscope for 150 to 300 cells.\n\nRESULTS\nFusion of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to Icm/Dot-translo-\ncated substrates interferes with translocation. The fusion of se-\ncreted proteins to DHFR, a rapidly folding enzyme that can be\nstabilized in its folded conformation with folate analogs, is com-\nmonly used to monitor whether proteins can be secreted or trans-\nlocated in a folded state (33, 37\u201339, 43, 53). To analyze if translo-\ncation via the Legionella pneumophila Icm/Dot type IVB secretion\nsystem can occur in the presence of folded substrates, fusions of\nseveral Icm/Dot-translocated substrates (IDTSs) to the carboxyl\nterminus of the murine DHFR were constructed. We chose four\ndifferent substrates to analyze. RalF and SidG were interrogated\nbecause there is considerable information regarding the nature of\nthe C-terminal translocation signals of these proteins as well as the\neffects of the mature protein sequences on translocation efficiency\n(34, 54). MavU was chosen because in a previous study we found\nthat its C-terminal signal was one of the most effective targeting\nsequences identified among the IDTSs, so we wanted to determine\nif a high-efficiency signal could overcome deficits caused by the\npresence of a folded domain (13). Finally, we wanted to investigate\nwhether the introduction of a folded domain internal to an IDTS\ncould have different effects from placing the domain upstream\n\nAmyot et al.\n\n3242 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\nttp\n\ns:\n//j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\ns.\n\nas\nm\n\n.o\nrg\n\n/jo\nur\n\nna\nl/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n19\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 7\n\n2.\n20\n\n3.\n11\n\n9.\n18\n\n.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nfrom the complete coding sequence. For this reason, we used\nLidA, because in previous studies we had identified important\njunctions between domains in the protein that we thought would\nlikely tolerate added sequences (55).\n\nTo detect translocation, each construction was tagged with the\ncalmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase enzymatic domain en-\ncoded by the Bordetella pertussis cyaA gene (Fig. 1A; Table 1).\nProduction of cAMP by these constructions requires transloca-\ntion into eukaryotic cells as bacteria do not express calmodulin\n(56). Expression of these CyaA constructs was induced by the\naddition of IPTG to cultures of the wild-type L. pneumophila\nstrain Lp02, and the bacteria were used to challenge the human\nmacrophage-like cell line U937. The translocation efficiency of\neach protein fusion into target U937 cells was quantified as intra-\ncellular cAMP produced by the CyaA-IDTS fusions, normalized\nto relative steady-state levels of the fusion within each strain (see\nMaterials and Methods) (13).\n\nEach of the IDTSs tested exhibited translocation defects when\nfused to DHFR (Fig. 1B), with each DHFR fusion showing trans-\nlocation levels that were between 8-fold (for DHFR-MavU) and\n40-fold (for DHFR-LidA) lower than the comparable fusions lack-\n\ning the DHFR moiety. In the case of DHFR-LidA, it appeared that\nDHFR totally blocked translocation; its translocation efficiency\nwas no greater than that observed with a mutant strain (dotA)\ncontaining a defective type IV system unable to translocate IDTS\n(Fig. 1B).\n\nInterestingly, the CyaA protein that was not fused to any IDTS\nstill translocated at levels \ufffd5-fold higher in a wild-type strain than\nin a dotA mutant background (Fig. 1B), and this level was higher\nthan what we observed with wild-type strains harboring the\nDHFR-LidA fusion. The CyaA construction had a short tail added\nto its carboxyl-terminal end to facilitate construction of the fu-\nsions, and this may have acted as a cryptic signal since the identical\nconstruction lacking this short carboxyl-terminal sequence\nshowed translocation levels as low as those of the dotA control (J.\nVogel, personal communication). This leakage through the Icm/\nDot complex was abolished when CyaA was fused to DHFR, indi-\ncating that the DHFR moiety alone is inhibitory to translocation\nthrough the Icm/Dot complex even when a cryptic translocation\nsignal is present in a protein (Fig. 1B).\n\nThere was considerable translocation of the protein having a\nDHFR fusion to MavU, presumably due to the extremely effective\nC-terminal signal, so we tested whether the relatively high levels of\ntranslocation were due to protein structure or the nature of the\nsignal. To this end, serial amino-terminal deletions of the L. pneu-\nmophila IDTS MavU (Lpg1798) were constructed to selectively\nremove domains in the protein. MavU is a 398-amino-acid pro-\ntein predicted to contain a Rho-GTPase-activating protein\n(RhoGAP) domain and a coiled-coil region (Fig. 2A). Therefore,\ntruncations were made immediately downstream of the RhoGAP\ndomain (Fig. 2, C186), flanking the predicted coiled-coil domain\n(C118 and C78), and just upstream of the predicted disordered\ncarboxyl terminus (C50) (Fig. 2A; Table 1). CyaA fusions to these\ntruncated proteins were all similarly expressed, and all exhibited\ntranslocation efficiencies that were similar to the translocation\nefficiency of the full-length MavU (Fig. 2B and C, black bars).\nTranslocation of each of the truncated proteins fused to DHFR\nwas then determined relative to the amount of full-length steady-\nstate protein found on gels (see Materials and Methods). All of\nthese DHFR fusion proteins were translocated at similar levels and\nshowed similar levels of defects, consistent with the idea that a\nspecific protein structure cannot ameliorate DHFR-mediated\ntranslocation defects (Fig. 2C). The observation that translocation\nof CyaA-DHFR-MavU(C50), encoding only the C-terminal 50\namino acids of MavU, was similar to that of the full-length MavU-\nDHFR fusion indicates that the sensitivity of an IDTS to translo-\ncation inhibition resulting from insertion of the DHFR moiety\ndoes not depend on the size of the hybrid protein but may be\nconnected to the efficiency at which the C-terminal signal can\nallow recognition by the Icm/Dot translocation system.\n\nThe DHFR moiety in IDTS fusions is enzymatically active. In\nmany of the previous studies examining the effects of protein fold-\ning on secretion, a DHFR inhibitor such as methotrexate (MTX),\nwhich inhibits both mammalian and bacterial proteins, was nec-\nessary to stabilize the DHFR in a folded conformation (37). As\nDHFR blocked IDTS translocation in the absence of MTX, we\ntested whether the inhibitor would cause further depression of\ntranslocation and whether the enzyme was folded in an active\nconfirmation, consistent with its ability to block translocation. As\nexpected, MTX had no effect on the growth in culture of the thy\nmutant strain used in these studies (data not shown). Further-\n\nFIG 1 Insertion of DHFR interferes with translocation.

For fu-\nsions containing the DHFR moiety, DHFR was fused to the carboxyl terminus\nof CyaA immediately upstream of an IDTS or translocation signal. (B) The\npresence of DHFR inhibits translocation. Translocation levels of the IDTS\nwere quantified by measuring intracellular cAMP levels resulting from CyaA.\nThe wild-type L. pneumophila strain Lp02 (black and gray bars) or the trans-\nlocation-defective dotA strain (striped bar) expressing the indicated CyaA pro-\ntein fusions was used to challenge U937 cells. After 1 h, intracellular cAMP\nlevels were determined by ELISA in cell lysates (see Materials and Methods).\nThe values represent the mean cAMP determined in seven separate experi-\nments (21 independent infections), normalized to the amount of the T4SS\nprotein DotF and steady-state levels of CyaA in the vector-alone control absent\nthe IDTS, as determined by immunoblotting of bacterial lysates.

This raised the possibility that the DHFR moiety was not\nassuming the conformation of the native active protein in these\nprotein fusions. Therefore, to determine whether DHFR placed\nwithin the chimeric proteins was in its native folded form, we\ntested if the derivatives were enzymatically active.\n\nDHFR activity of the CyaA-IDTS fusions was measured using a\ncolorimetric assay that detects the NADPH-dependent reduction\nof dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid (Fig. 3A) (see Materials\nand Methods). Cell lysates of L. pneumophila expressing CyaA-\n\nDHFR-IDTS fusions were incubated with NADPH and dihydro-\nfolic acid, and the accumulation of tetrahydrofolate was measured\n(see Materials and Methods). To determine the specific activity,\nthe rate of hydrolysis as a function of protein concentration was\ndetermined by quantitating the amount of fusion protein ex-\npressed for each sample (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 3B).\nTrimethoprim was added to eliminate the endogenous L. pneu-\nmophila DHFR activity as, unlike MTX (57), this antibiotic inhib-\nits the prokaryotic protein specifically and has no effect on the\nmammalian DHFR present in the fusions (Fig. 2C). The specific\nactivities of DHFR in the protein fusions were comparable to\nthose of purified DHFR, consistent with proper folding of this\nmoiety (Fig. 2C). As expected, no activity was seen in a CyaA-\nIDTS fusion that did not have DHFR, and the enzymatic activity in\n\nFIG 2 Serial truncations of MavU fused to DHFR exhibit equivalent defects in\ntranslocation competence.

The data are con-\nsistent with a folded protein moiety causing defective substrate\ntranslocation.\n\nDHFR does not interfere with cyclase activity or increase ag-\ngregation of the chimeric proteins. One complication of using\nCyaA fusions is that the assay is contingent on the enzymatic ac-\ntivity of the CyaA moiety being unaffected by the IDTS sequence.\nTherefore, it was necessary to exclude the possibility that the pres-\nence of DHFR inhibits adenylate cyclase activity. A modified, in\nvitro version of the CyaA translocation assay was established to\nquantify the enzymatic activity of CyaA-DHFR-IDTS fusions rel-\native to the respective CyaA-IDTS. L. pneumophila cultures were\ngrown to late exponential phase, induced to express the CyaA\nconstructs, and lysed. The supernatants of the bacterial lysates\nwere incubated for 30 min in the presence of calmodulin and the\nadenylate cyclase substrate ATP, and the resulting cAMP produc-\ntion was measured via ELISA (see Materials and Methods). No\nsignificant difference was observed in the CyaA activities of any of\nthe protein fusions, regardless of DHFR, confirming that DHFR is\nnot inhibiting the activity of the marker enzyme (Fig. 4A). Similar\ndata were seen when the incubation period was shortened to 5\nmin, indicating that the longer reaction time did not overload the\nsystem (data not shown). Background levels of cAMP produced\nby L. pneumophila not expressing any CyaA fusion and a reaction\nmixture lacking calmodulin confirmed that adenylate cyclase ac-\ntivity was due to the B. pertussis CyaA. The culture supernatant\nfrom a strain that was not lysed also did not produce significant\nlevels of cAMP, consistent with previous research showing that\nIcm/Dot secretion occurs only after contact with a host cell (58).\nThese data are consistent with the DHFR moiety having no effect\non cyclase activity, with the caveat that it is possible that after\ntranslocation into host cells, the folding properties of the translo-\ncated substrate may differ significantly from that observed in bac-\nterial extracts.\n\nWe next determined if DHFR hinders translocation by causing\naggregation of the fusions. To compare aggregation of DHFR fu-\nsions and IDTS alone, we lysed cells and compared the relative\namounts of soluble and pelleted protein after high-speed centrif-\nugation. The presence of substrate proteins in postcentrifugation\nfractions was visualized via immunoblots probed with anti-CyaA\n(Fig. 4B) (see Materials and Methods). The percentage of aggre-\ngation was determined as the amount of CyaA fusion protein that\nprecipitated after high-speed centrifugation relative to the total\nprotein retrieved, as quantified by densitometry of the immuno-\nblots. In all strains tested, no significant difference in aggregation\nwas seen between the IDTS fusions in the presence or absence of\nDHFR, demonstrating that DHFR does not cause protein aggre-\ngation (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, a majority of the protein remained\nsoluble after centrifugation in the strains expressing RalF and\nMavU fusions, but in the strains expressing SidG fusions, nearly all\nprotein recovered from the high-speed centrifugation was seen in\nthe pellets. Although a relatively small amount of soluble SidG\nprotein appears to be available, our results show that SidG is still\nreadily translocated. These results are consistent with the model\nthat the DHFR moiety does not cause aggregation and that aggre-\ngation does not correlate with decreased translocation.\n\nInterference of IDTS translocation by ubiquitin requires\nfolding of the interfering moiety. Although the data presented\nargue that the DHFR moiety was folded and did not interfere with\nthe reporter readout, we could not analyze the consequences of\n\nconditional folding of an interfering moiety. Therefore, we ana-\nlyzed ubiquitin (Ub) fusions to IDTSs as mutant Ub derivatives\nexist that are poorly folded, allowing us to compare folded and\nunfolded internal domains. As with DHFR, ubiquitin (Ub) is a\ncompact, rapidly folding protein that can serve as a disruptive\ndomain for secreted substrates in multiple systems (43, 59, 60).\nFurthermore, simple mutations can be used to destabilize the pro-\ntein and yield an unfolded control for secretion assays (43, 59). To\nthis end, we constructed a fusion of RalF tagged with CyaA to a Ub\nprotein in which two residues in the hydrophobic core (Ile3 and\nIle13) are replaced with Gly (UbG3,13) to destabilize the protein\nconformation (Fig. 5A) (59).\n\nInterestingly, we found that the CyaA-RalF fusion to wild-type\nUb was cleaved in the cytosol of L. pneumophila (Fig. 5B). This\nmay be due to a deubiquitinating protease (DUB) that was pre-\ndicted bioinformatically to be encoded by L. pneumophila\n(Lpg2907; MavW) (13, 61). In contrast, the UbG3,13 protein was\nnot cleaved, consistent with the interpretation that these muta-\ntions prevent folding of the Ub domain. As cleaved Ub fusion\nproteins would be uninformative in our experiments, we con-\nstructed an additional Ub construct by replacing the terminal res-\nidue (Gly76) with a Val residue (UbV76). This mutation alters the\nsite of proteolytic cleavage by DUBs without perturbing the fold-\ning of Ub (62).\n\nCyaA-RalF fused to the folded, uncleavable UbV76 demon-\nstrated very low translocation efficiency (Fig. 5C), resulting in\ncAMP levels similar to those of the dotA strain. In contrast, the\nfusion protein having the unfolded UbG3,13 derivative was trans-\nlocated at a small but significantly (P \ufffd 0.02) higher efficiency\nthan CyaA-RalF alone. Taking these results together with the\nDHFR data, we conclude that the extent to which an IDTS main-\ntains a region with a folded conformation inversely correlates with\nits translocation efficiency.\n\nThe DHFR-MavU fusion protein exhibits a kinetic defect in\ntranslocation. The above analysis shows that accumulation of the\nfusion proteins is lowered by the presence of a poison domain but\ndoes not investigate whether there is premature termination of secre-\ntion or whether the domain slows the rate of translocation. To carry\nout real-time, kinetic analysis of translocation to answer this ques-\ntion, we adapted the GloSensor cAMP assay (see Materials and Meth-\nods). The system uses a modified Photinus pyralis luciferase that con-\ntains a cAMP-binding domain. Binding of cAMP causes a\nconformational change that allows the luciferase to interact with its\nsubstrate to produce light. For our purposes, monolayers of 293T\ncells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the modified\nluciferase and the Fc\ufffdRIIA receptor (to facilitate uptake of IgG-op-\nsonized L. pneumophila) were preincubated with the luciferase sub-\nstrate and then challenged with L. pneumophila strains harboring\nIDTSs fused to CyaA. Intracellular cAMP resulting from transloca-\ntion of the adenylate cyclase was monitored by the luminescent out-\nput over the course of the infection (see Materials and Methods). The\nkinetic analysis agreed strongly with the endpoint cAMP assay.\nDHFR fusions to RalF and SidG, as well as the CyaA gene itself, re-\nsulted in a substantial kinetic delay in luminescence signal (decreased\nrate of transfer as represented by depressed slope and increased time-\nto-half-maximal signal). (Fig. 6A and B). In each case, the time to\nhalf-maximal luminescence for the wild-type proteins fused to Cya\nwas approximately 5 min (Fig. 6A to C). In contrast, for the DHFR\nfusions to RalF and SidG, the time to half-maximal luminescence was\nat least 30 min (Fig. 6A and B).

Both assays are consis-\ntent with an initial kinetic delay caused by DHFR fusion to\nMavU of about 15 to 20 min. This indicates that for at least\n\nFIG 4 Translocation deficiency is not due to loss of adenylate cyclase activity or aggregation of fusion proteins. (A) Adenylate cyclase activity is unaffected by\nDHFR. Bacterial lysates were incubated in the presence of ATP and calmodulin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C to allow for the production of cAMP. Samples were harvested and\nassayed as described in Materials and Methods. (B) Aggregation of IDTS protein fusions does not correlate with translocation defects of DHFR-IDTS fusions. L.\npneumophila wild-type strains expressing the fusions were lysed, and cell debris was cleared by low-speed centrifugation. The resulting supernatant fraction was subjected\nto centrifugation at 90,000 \ufffd g for 1 h to precipitate any aggregated protein. Supernatant and pellet fractions after centrifugation were analyzed by Western blotting with\nanti-CyaA and anti-ICDH antibody probes.

The\n\nIcmS/W adaptor complex is necessary for translocation of a large\nsubset of L. pneumophila effectors (63, 64). Previous work indi-\ncated that the IcmS/W complex binds to several different IDTSs,\nand in the case of SidG, this appears to alter the conformational\nstate of the protein (34). Furthermore, IcmS is necessary for the\nstability of the T4BSS coupling protein DotL and binds directly to\nDotL (32, 64). Therefore, if folded DHFR precludes IcmS from\nbinding the IDTS fusions, the folded moiety could restrict the\nsubstrate from forming a translocation-competent conformation\nwith IcmS/W.\n\nTo investigate whether the presence of DHFR precludes IcmS\nfrom facilitating translocation, we first compared translocation of\nDHFR-MavU in the wild type (Lp02) to an icmS deletion mutant\nof L. pneumophila. The translocation efficiency of DHFR-MavU\nwas more than 10-fold lower in the \ufffdicmS strain than in the wild\ntype, similar to the magnitude of defect found with the parental\nMavU fusion (Fig. 7A). This indicates that the IcmS/IcmW com-\nplex is still necessary and capable of facilitating translocation of\nthe DHFR fusion and is consistent with DHFR interfering with\ntranslocation at some level other than IcmS/W interactions.\n\nTo further determine if DHFR prevented association of the\nIcmS/W complex with IDTSs, we determined the relative fraction\nof fusions that coassociate with the chaperone in the presence or\nabsence of the DHFR moiety (Fig. 7B). Either CyaA-MavU or\nCyaA-DHFR-MavU was coexpressed in E. coli with a GST-IcmS/\nIcmW complex (see Materials and Methods) (Table 1). Lysates\nwere incubated with immobilized glutathione resin, bound pro-\nteins were eluted with reduced glutathione, and CyaA-tagged\nproteins bound to GST-IcmS/IcmW were detected by immuno-\nblotting. There was no significant difference in binding to GST-\nIcmS/W between CyaA-MavU and CyaA-DHFR-MavU (Fig. 7B).\nIn contrast, little fusion protein was associated with the resin in\nthe absence of coexpression of the GST-IcmS/W complex or if\nGST alone was coexpressed with the fusions (Fig. 7B). We thus\nconfirm that the folded DHFR moiety does not interfere with the\ninteraction of IcmS/W with IDTSs.\n\nIDTS fused to folded DHFR or Ub interferes with Icm/Dot\nsecretion channel function. It is well documented that secretion\nsignals fused to secretion-incompetent proteins often result in\nblockage of the translocation channel, resulting in a severe atten-\nuation of channel function (36). Most relevant to this study, in-\ntroduction of DHFR and Ub to type III secretion system-translo-\ncated substrates in Yersinia enterocolitica has been shown to\ninterfere with transport of other proteins through this channel\n(43, 65). As the DHFR and Ub fusions interfered with transloca-\ntion in the Icm/Dot T4SS, we tested whether these constructions\ncould occlude translocation of other IDTSs or slow the rate of\ntranslocation to the extent that there would be defective intracel-\nlular growth due to a blockage the Icm/Dot system, which is\nknown to be essential for intracellular growth.\n\nTo determine if introducing a folded moiety into RalF causes\ntranslocation inhibition, we monitored export of an endoge-\nnously expressed IDTS, SidC, in strains overproducing RalF fu-\nsions having either folded or unfolded domains inserted. U937\ncells were challenged for 1.5 h with L. pneumophila that expresses\neither RalF or one of the RalF fusions (Fig. 8A and B), and cells\nwere lysed with digitonin. The detergent-soluble and -insoluble\nfractions were then analyzed by immunoblotting to identify ex-\nported and bacterium-associated SidC, respectively (55) (see Ma-\nterials and Methods). Strains expressing either the UbV76 or\n\nFIG 5 Folded ubiquitin inhibits translocation of fused Icm/Dot substrates.\nU937 cells were challenged with the wild-type L. pneumophila strain Lp02 or a\ntranslocation-defective dotA strain expressing CyaA-tagged RalF fused to ei-\nther ubiquitin, a nonfolding variant of ubiquitin (UbG3,13), or a variant that\ncannot be cleaved by DUBs (UbV76).

Therefore,\noverproduction of the translocation-incompetent proteins inter-\nferes with function of the Icm/Dot translocon.\n\nTo determine if interference with translocation also inhibits\nintracellular bacterial replication, an intracellular growth assay of\nL. pneumophila overexpressing RalF fused to DHFR, UbG3,13, or\nUbV76 was performed. Monolayers of bone marrow-derived mac-\nrophages from A/J mice were challenged with wild-type L. pneu-\nmophila expressing the reporter protein fusions for 14 h, which is\napproximately one round of infection. Cells were fixed, and the\nnumber of bacteria in individual Legionella-containing vacuoles\n(LCVs) was determined by microscopy. In strains harboring RalF\nalone or RalF fused to the unfolded UbG3,13 variant, approxi-\nmately 60% of LCVs were large vacuoles with 11 or more bacteria,\nconsistent with efficient growth in the presence of these proteins.\nIn the strain expressing the DHFR fusion, the presence of DHFR\nrestricted growth, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of\nvacuoles that had small numbers of bacteria (1\u20133), with a corre-\nsponding decrease in vacuoles having more than 11 bacteria (Fig.\n8C). The growth defect was most pronounced in the strain ex-\npressing the folded ubiquitin (UbV76), with the percentage of large\nvacuoles of 11 or more bacteria decreasing approximately 4-fold\ncompared to the strain expressing the unfolded Ub fusion (Fig.\n8C). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the percent-\nage of small and medium-sized vacuoles, consistent with de-\ncreased growth in the presence of this fusion. This phenotype is\nindicative of a partial blockage of the translocon by folded pro-\nteins, reducing the rate of translocation of IDTSs needed for bac-\nterial replication. Therefore, occlusion of the channel by the in-\ntroduction of a folded domain interferes with the ability of L.\npneumophila to grow intracellularly.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we show that translocation of substrates of the Icm/\nDot T4SS into host cells is depressed by the presence of moieties\nthat assume folded conformations. Fusion proteins of DHFR and\nUb to IDTSs demonstrate a defect in translocation compared to\ntheir unfolded counterparts (Fig. 1 and 5). Furthermore, there was\na small but significant increase in translocation of the IDTS RalF\nfused to a destabilized variant of ubiquitin (UbG3,13) relative to\nRalF alone, consistent with an unfolded region stimulating trans-\nlocation (Fig. 5). If the unstructured moiety increases the amount\nof unfolding of the entire IDTS, translocation competence may be\ndefined by the ability of the IDTS to maintain an unfolded con-\nformation.\n\nMany IDTSs are translated prior to infection, as indicated by\nthe fact that protein synthesis inhibitors do not affect transloca-\ntion rates (58). If we consider this in context with our data, the\n\nFIG 6 The DHFR-IDTS fusion proteins exhibit kinetic defects in transloca-\ntion. Results of real-time translocation assays of CyaA and Cya-DHFR moi-\neties fused to IDTS RalF (A), SidG (B), and MavU (C) are shown. HEK293 cells\ntransiently transfected with the pGloSensor cAMP biosensor plasmid and\nFc\ufffdRIIA were incubated with the pGloSensor luciferase substrate reagent for\n\n1 h (see Materials and Methods). Cells were challenged with bacterial strains\nexpressing the indicated proteins that had been opsonized with anti-Legionella\nIgG.

These may be heat shock proteins or uncharacterized\nchaperones but also could include the adapter protein complexes\nof IcmS/W and IcmS/LvgA (64). These small proteins are hypoth-\nesized to resemble the type III secretion system chaperones which\nact to hold proteins in a partially unfolded conformation for de-\nlivery to the translocon ATPase for subsequent unfolding and se-\ncretion (45, 46, 66). Consistent with a role for these proteins form-\ning a pretranslocation complex, IcmS/W can associate with\n\nFIG 7 DHFR does not preclude interaction of the IcmS adapter protein with\nthe IDTS protein fusions. (A) Lowered translocation of DHFR-MavU fusions\nto MavU in the absence of IcmS. CyaA-MavU and CyaA-DHFR-MavU were\nexpressed in the wild-type strain (Lp02) and an IcmS-deficient strain (\ufffdicmS\nstrain) and used to challenge U937 cells. A CyaA translocation assay was per-\nformed as described in the legend of Fig. 2. The values represent the average\namount of cAMP determined by ELISA in five independent experiments (15\nindependent infections) normalized to the amount of the T4SS protein DotF\nexpressed and then normalized to the amount of CyaA in the vector.

Bound GST-IcmS and complexed proteins were eluted by reduced glutathi-\none and concentrated by TCA precipitation. Protein samples were analyzed via\nWestern blotting using anti-CyaA. Shown are the clarified lysate (IN) and the\neluate concentrated 20-fold (E). The experiment was performed twice. The IN\nand E lanes from each sample were analyzed on a single blot but were loaded on\nnoncontiguous lanes, as noted by gaps between lanes.\n\nFIG 8 Folded protein fusions cause a partial blockage of the Icm/Dot translocon.\n(A) Translocation of SidC is decreased in strains harboring folded fusions.

The number of intracellular bacteria in individual vacuoles was\ndetermined for 100 cells each on three individual replicates for each sample.

This\npretranslocation complex appears to be the form that is presented\nto the secretion channel as IcmS binds directly to DotL, the secre-\ntion ATPase in the Icm/Dot system (32). Although insertion of\nDHFR interfered with translocation, IcmS/W was still able to in-\nteract with MavU- and SidG-DHFR fusions, and IcmS was neces-\nsary to facilitate the translocation of the DHFR-MavU fusion (Fig.\n7). These results indicate that the defect in translocation observed\nin this work is independent of IcmS/W action.\n\nUsing two different assays, we were able to demonstrate that\nthe DHFR moiety decreases the rate of protein transport (Fig. 6).\nTwo models can explain this result. The first possibility is that a\nfolded domain does not cause an absolute block in translocation,\neither because the Icm/Dot system has some intrinsic ability to\ntranslocate folded proteins or because the secretion system is able\nto convert translocation-incompetent substrates into transferra-\nble conformations. The second possibility is that there is a small\nsubpopulation of proteins that are partially unfolded. In either\nmodel, the extent to which a protein is in a translocation-compe-\ntent conformation directly correlates with the rate that it can be\ntransported through the Icm/Dot translocon.\n\nIn addition to the translocation defect of a tightly folded pro-\ntein, the effector fusions interfere with translocation of other\nIDTSs (Fig. 8), consistent with at least partial occlusion of the\ntranslocon. In the case of the Yersinia T3SS, the presence of folded\ndomains in translocated substrates interferes with the assembly of\nspecific components necessary for the function of the translocon\n(65). Although we cannot exclude this possibility, the fact that the\nDHFR fusions are very poorly translocated but cause only partial\ninterference with intracellular growth (Fig. 8) is consistent with\nthe Icm/Dot complex being largely intact. We propose two models\nfor the mechanism of this blockage. First, the interfering protein\nfusion could disrupt transport of only a subset of translocated\neffectors that are critical for intracellular growth. The second\nmodel is that the fusion protein is stalled within the secretion\nchannel, causing a global decrease in the rate of all IDTSs. The low\nrate of transport of the fusion proteins could generate a situation\nakin to a traffic jam, in which a group of slow-moving individuals\ncauses a general reduction in the rate of movement of all individ-\nuals moving through the secretion channel.\n\nIf stalled or slow-moving substrates cause the generalized\ntranslocation defect, then there must be some explanation for why\nsuch interference occurs. Although the structure of the T4BSS has\nnot been fully elucidated, cryo-electron microscopic and crystal\nstructures of core components of a T4SS from plasmid pKM101\nhave been solved. While the Icm/Dot system constitutes a differ-\nent class of secretion apparatus (T4BSS), some insight can be\ngained from considering the known structure. Cryo-electron mi-\ncroscopy of the T4SS reveals a unique structure in which the core\nforms a large, bulbous chamber between the inner and outer\nmembranes (47). Importantly, the channel is constricted at the\ncapped outer membrane face, which the crystal structure suggests\nundergoes a conformational change that could restrict the chan-\nnel at the outer membrane, allowing opening or closing of the\nsecretion pore (30, 47). At the base of the structure is a large\nentryway of 55 nm although it is believed that other components\nof the secretion system could fit within this entryway and make for\na much narrower passage site (47). Based upon this configuration,\nat the very least, the transport of folded proteins through the Icm/\nDot system may be hindered while exiting the translocon. This\n\nsituation would likely lead to the accumulation of proteins within\nthe secretion system core.\n\nBlocks could also occur at the entry site of the secretion com-\nplex. In this scenario, initiation of movement into the secretion\ncomplex would result in a frustrated intermediate in which there is\na physical block at the entrance. Furthermore, occlusion of IDTSs\ncould occur at a step that is prior to entry into the complex. In the\nT3SS, folded effector fusions prevent translocation of other IDTSs\nby binding to and inhibiting the ATPase associated with the secre-\ntion system (65). Normally, chaperones carry their cognate sub-\nstrates to the T3SS in a partially unfolded conformation, thus\n\u201cpriming\u201d them for complete unfolding by the ATPase before\ntranslocation (45, 46). In the Icm/Dot system it has been proposed\nthat DotL, as part of a subcomplex with the ATPases DotM and\nDotN, acts as a regulator of IDTS entry (67). DotL has sequence\nsimilarity to type IV secretion system coupling proteins, which are\nproposed to link substrates to the rest of the secretion complex\n(68). The fact that DotL associates with IcmS could be key to\nlinking the substrate to the secretion system. Folded proteins may\nbe blocked from entry by an inappropriate interaction with DotL,\nthus inhibiting further translocation of effectors.\n\nThese studies demonstrate that small folded domains can gen-\nerate impassable substrates through the L. pneumophila T4SS,\nconsistent with a strong selection against such moieties being\npresent in IDTSs. Therefore, it would appear that most IDTSs are\neither easily unfolded, maintained with chaperones in an unfolded\nconformation, or have determinants that allow recognition by un-\nfoldases associated with the Icm/Dot complex. Future work will\nrequire identifying the features of the substrates that allow them to\nbe secretion competent and determining which bacterial proteins\ncontribute to generating structures that maintain this conforma-\ntion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nR.R.I. is an investigator of HHMI, while W.M.A. and D.D. were supported\nby NIH training grant T32AI00742.

Here, we report that ERRc directly regulates CREBH gene expression in\nresponse to ER stress. ERRc bound to the ERRc response element (ERRE) in the CREBH promoter. Overexpression of ERRc by\nadenovirus significantly increased expression of CREBH as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas either knockdown of\nERRc or inhibition of ERRc by ERRc specific inverse agonist, GSK5182, substantially inhibited ER stress-mediated induction of\nCREBH and CRP. The transcriptional coactivator PGC1a was required for ERRc mediated induction of the CREBH gene as\ndemonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showing binding of both ERRc and PGC1a on the CREBH\npromoter. The ChIP assay also revealed that histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurred at the ERRc and PGC1a binding site.\nMoreover, chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis, as well as the diabetic obese condition significantly increased CRP gene\nexpression, and this increase was significantly attenuated by GSK5182 treatment. We suggest that orphan nuclear receptor\nERRc directly regulates the ER-bound transcription factor CREBH in response to ER stress and other metabolic conditions.\n\nCitation: Misra J, Chanda D, Kim D-K, Cho S-R, Koo S-H, et al.

These orphan nuclear receptors regulate transcription via\nERREs but do not bind endogenous estrogen [1]. The ERRs are\n\nnamed due to the conservation in the structure of their DNA-\n\nbinding domains/DBDs with the highly homologous Estrogen\n\nReceptor [2]. Crystallographic studies indicate that the ERRs\n\nalong with ERRc are constitutively active without a natural\nligand, while several synthetic ligands either stimulate or repress\n\nthe activity of ERRc by promoting or disrupting ERR\u2013coactivator\ninteractions [3]. Among them GSK5182, a 4-hydroxy tamoxifen\n\nanalogue, is a selective inverse agonist of ERRc and directly binds\nto the ligand binding domain and inhibits transactivation by\n\nERRc [4\u20138]. ERRc is primarily expressed in heart, brain, kidney,\npancreas and liver tissues [3]. We previously reported that hepatic\n\nERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by directly binding to the\nPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose 6-\n\nphosphatase (G6Pase) promoters along with coactivator PGC-1a\n\n[5]. Previous results from our laboratory also demonstrated that\n\nERRc directly binds to the LIPIN1 promoter along with\ncoactivator PGC-1a to regulate LIPIN1 gene expression, and\ninhibits hepatic insulin signaling [6]. ERRc also controls hepatic\nCB1 receptor-mediated CYP2E1 expression at the transcriptional\n\nlevel and thus contributes to the oxidative liver injury by alcohol\n\n[7]. Finally, hypoxia induces PDK4 gene expression through\n\ninduction of ERRc [8]. The transcriptional activity of the ERR\nfamily is dependent on interactions with coactivators, in particular\n\nPGC-1a and PGC-1b [9]. ERRa and ERRc regulate mitochon-\ndrial programs involved in oxidative phosphorylation and a\n\nnuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinates\n\nthe postnatal metabolic transition in the heart [9]. Though all\n\nthese reports clearly suggest a key role of ERRc in different\ncellular processes, its role in ER stress is yet to be determined.\n\nER stress is a state associated with perturbation of ER\n\nhomeostasis and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins\n\nin the ER [10]. CREBH, an ER-stress-activated liver enriched\n\ntranscription factor, has been previously reported to transcrip-\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342\n\n\n\ntionally activate acute phase response genes in the liver in response\n\nto lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines\n\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) [11].\nRecently, CREBH has been demonstrated to play a critical role in\n\nER-stress-mediated regulation of iron metabolism via induction of\n\nhepcidin (Hamp) gene expression, in triglyceride metabolism and\n\nhepatic lipogenesis, and in the mediation of the hormonal\n\nregulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis under fasting or insulin-\n\nresistant conditions [12\u201315], thereby underlining the importance\n\nof CREBH in various hepatic metabolic pathways. Recent studies\n\nfrom our group have demonstrated that activation of Cb1r leads to\n\nphosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling\n\npathway which in turn activates CREBH. This Cb1r-JNK-\n\nCREBH pathway was further demonstrated to regulate hepatic\n\ngluconeogenesis by regulating key gluconeogenic genes (PEPCK,\n\nand G6Pase) and lipid metabolism by regulating Lipin1 [16\u201317].\n\nOur group has also reported that hepatic cannabinoid receptor\n\ntype 1 mediates alcohol-induced regulation of bile acid enzyme\n\ngenes (CYP7A1, and CYP27A1) expression via CREBH [18].\n\nPGC-1a, a member of a small family of coactivators, was\nidentified using yeast two hybrid assays for PPARc-interacting\nproteins [19] and is implicated in mitochondrial metabolism,\n\nthermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, adipocyte differentia-\n\ntion, gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake [20\u201321]. PGC-1a targets\npromoters by interacting directly with numerous DNA binding\n\ntranscription factors and then coordinating several biochemical\n\nevents, including recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes\n\nsuch as p300/CBP and SRC-1, interaction with the basal\n\ntranscription machinery and linking of transcription to RNA\n\nsplicing [22].\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP) in comparison to other inflammation\n\nmarkers is a relatively stable, robust and an exquisitely sensitive\n\nserum protein. In some studies, CRP level in plasma predicts\n\ncardiovascular events even better than low-density lipoprotein\n\ncholesterol level [23]. Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic\n\nstudies have shown that CRP is not just a marker but rather an\n\nactive mediator for endothelial dysfunction, arterial thrombosis\n\nand atherogenesis [24\u201325]. CRP, as an inflammatory cytokine, is\n\nprimarily synthesized in liver and regulated in response to\n\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b) [26\u201328]. Hepato-\ncytes are believed to be the major contributor of circulating CRP\n\nin plasma. Therefore, hepatic CRP is able to cause liver per se\n\ndamage and inflammation, and plays a key role in the\n\ndevelopment of atherosclerosis when entering into the blood\n\ncirculation. In hepatoma cell lines, the endogenous CRP gene is\n\neither dysregulated or weakly active [29]. However, plasma levels\n\nof CRP may rise rapidly and markedly (.1000 fold) after an acute\n\ninflammation in human [30].\n\nHere, we examined the mechanism of how nuclear receptor,\n\nERRc regulates ER bound bZIP transcription factor, CREBH\nunder the conditions of ER stress.

Differences were\n\nconsidered statistically significant at p,0.05.\n\nResults\n\nERRc Induces CREBH Gene Expression\nPrevious reports suggest various nuclear receptors and tran-\n\nscription factors cross talk to regulate the mammalian ER stress\n\nresponse [35\u201336]. In addition, the nuclear receptors GR, PPARa,\nand HNF4a regulate transcription of the ER bound transcription\nfactor CREBH [15,36\u201337]. We demonstrated previously that\n\nERRc regulates ATF6a in response to ER stress [38]. To\ninvestigate whether ERRc regulates CREBH, which belongs to\nthe same CREB3 family as ATF6 and is structurally related to it,\n\nERRc was overexpressed by Ad-ERRc in AML12 cells. Interest-\ningly, CREBH mRNA level, as determined by qPCR, increased\n\nmore than six-fold after ERRc overexpression (Fig. 1A). CREBH\nprotein level, as determined by Western blot, also increased under\n\nthe same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). Next, to check\n\nwhether CREBH gene induction was ERRc specific, ERRa was\noverexpressed in AML12 cells by adenovirus. No significant\n\nchange in CREBH protein level was observed after ERRa\noverexpression, suggesting that CREBH gene induction is ERRc\nspecific (Fig. 1C). To verify these in vitro results, mice were infected\n\nwith Ad-ERRc by tail vein injection. Consistent with the in vitro\nresults, an almost fivefold increase in CREBH mRNA level was\n\nobserved. A significant increase in CREBH-N (active form) protein\n\nlevel was also observed in vivo (Fig. 1D and 1E). As observed in the\n\nmouse cell lines, we noticed a similar effect of ERRc overexpres-\nsion in HepG2 cells. ERRc overexpression significantly increased\nCREBH mRNA, and protein levels (Fig. 1F and G), indicating\n\nFigure 4. ERRc regulates CREBH target gene.

Collectively these\n\nresults demonstrate that ERRc positively regulates CREBH gene\nexpression.\n\nER Stress Induces CREBH Gene Expression via ERRc\nNext, we ascertained the molecular mechanism of ERRc-\n\nmediated CREBH gene induction. A transient transfection assay\n\nwas performed with the ERRc expression vector and the mouse\nand human CREBH promoter- driven luciferase reporter gene\n\n(Fig. 2A, and B). ERRc significantly enhanced both mouse and\nhuman CREBH promoter activity. It was reported previously that\n\ntunicamycin (Tm) induces CREBH and ERRc gene expression\n[11,38]. To investigate whether Tm mediated activation of the\n\nCREBH promoter depends on ERRc, a transient transfection\nassay was performed with the mouse CREBH promoter-driven\n\nluciferase reporter gene. Tm treatment significantly increased\n\nCREBH promoter activity but activation was severely compro-\n\nmised when endogenous ERRc was knocked down (Fig. 2C).\nNext, AML12 cells were treated with Tm or infected with Ad-\n\nshERRc to knockdown endogenous ERRc to observe the effect of\nERRc knockdown on CREBH gene expression. As expected,\n\nknockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly suppressed the Tm-\nmediated increase in CREBH mRNA level (Fig. 2D). Next, we\n\nperformed Western blot analyses to check the CREBH-N protein\n\nlevel under the same experimental conditions. In agreement with\n\nthe mRNA level, CREBH-N protein level also decreased\n\nsignificantly in response to Ad-shERRc infection (Fig. 2E) in\nAML12 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that\n\nERRc mediates the induction of CREBH gene expression by ER\nstress.\n\nERRc Activates CREBH Gene Promoter via an ERRE\nPGC1a acts as an ERRc coactivator [6]. To test whether\n\nPGC1a and ERRc together play any role in the induction of\nCREBH, transient transfection assays were performed with the\n\nmouse CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene and\n\nERRc and PGC1a expression vectors. ERRc significantly\nincreased CREBH promoter activity, and this activity was further\n\naugmented in the presence of PGC1a (Fig. 3A). A series of\ndeletion constructs was analyzed to identify the DNA sequence\n\nconferring the ERRc-mediated ER stress effect on the CREBH\npromoter. Deletion of the CREBH promoter sequence from\n\n0.2 kb to 0.1 kb drastically decreased the promoter activity\n\nconferred by ERRc, suggesting that the region from 0.2 kb to\n0.1 kb confers activation of the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3B). It was\n\nreported previously that ERRc binds to a consensus sequence\nAGGTCA [38]. We aligned this sequence with the CREBH\n\npromoter region from 0.2 kb to 0.1 kb and found a perfect match\n\nto the consensus sequence, AGGTCA, spanning the 0.2 kb to\n\n0.1 kb region. Transient transfection assays were performed using\n\nwild-type and AGGTCA mutant CREBH promoters with the\n\nERRc expression vector to test whether AGGTCA is critical for\nERRc binding. This mutant reporter did not show any significant\nresponse to ERRc cotransfection (Fig. 3C). Next, the ChIP assay\nwas performed to monitor the effect of Tm on ERRc and PGC1a\nrecruitment to the endogenous CREBH gene promoter. Under\n\nbasal conditions, both ERRc and PGC1a occupied the CREBH\npromoter. However, Tm treatment significantly augmented ERRc\nand PGC1a occupancy on the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3D). The\nChIP assay results provide critical in vivo evidence that the ER-\n\nstress-ERRc-PGC1a signaling pathway increases CREBH gene\ntranscription. Gene activation is often associated with increased\n\nhistone acetylation [39], and the ChIP assay was performed to\n\ndetermine whether Tm treatment results in increased template-\n\nassociated histone (H3 and/or H4) acetylation of the CREBH\n\ngene promoter in AML12 cells (Fig. 3E). Tm treatment and\n\nadenoviral overexpression of ERRc and/or PGC1a increased\nacetylation of H3 (Ac\u2013H3) and H4 (Ac\u2013H4) on the ERRc-\nresponsive region of the CREBH promoter, whereas knockdown\n\nof endogenous ERRc or PGC1a significantly reduced histone (H3\nand/or H4) acetylation. We observed a synergistic effect of ERRc\nand PGC1a overexpression on acetylation of H3 (Ac\u2013H3) and H4\n(Ac\u2013H4) (Fig. 3E) which was in accordance with our previous\n\nresults (Fig. 3A) where, synergistic effect on CREBH promoter\n\nactivation was clearly observed by cotransfection of ERRc and\nPGC1a with CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene.\nOverall, these results demonstrate that ER stress augments the\n\nbinding of ERRc and PGC1a to the CREBH promoter and\nincreases template-associated histone (H3 and H4) acetylation to\n\nfacilitate CREBH gene transcription.\n\nEffect of ERRc Knockdown on CREBH-mediated\nRegulation of CRP Gene Expression\nNext, we examined regulation of CREBH target genes. Our\n\nresults (Figs. 1\u20133) demonstrate that ERRc regulates CREBH gene\n\nFigure 5.

CRP is a well-known marker\n\nof various human diseases and is regulated by CREBH in response\n\nto ER stress [11]. We examined the effect of ERRc knockdown on\nTm mediated CRP promoter activation by transient transfection\n\nassay in 293T cells to verify the effect of ERRc on CREBH target\ngene (Fig. 4A). Both Tm treatment and ERRc overexpression\nsignificantly increased CRP promoter activation. However,\n\nknockdown of endogenous ERRc or CREBH significantly blunted\nthe increase in CRP promoter activation by Tm. These results\n\ndemonstrate that Tm-induced CRP promoter activation is\n\nmediated through ERRc. Next, ERRc was overexpressed in\nAML12 cells to confirm the effect of ERRc on CRP gene\nexpression (Fig. 4B). As expected, ERRc overexpression signifi-\ncantly increased both CRP mRNA and protein levels, and this\n\nincrease was significantly attenuated upon endogenous CREBH\n\nknockdown. This result indicates that ERRc regulates CRP gene\nexpression through CREBH. Endogenous ERRc was knocked\ndown in AML12 cells for further verification. In agreement with\n\nthe previous results, we observed that the Tm-mediated increase in\n\nCRP mRNA and protein was substantially reduced after ERRc\nknockdown (Fig. 4C). Taken together, we demonstrated that\n\nERRc induces CREBH target genes by regulating CREBH itself.\n\nAlcohol Feeding and Diabetic Obesity Induce Hepatic\nCREBH and CRP Gene Expression via Hepatic ERRc\nOur results (Figs. 1\u20134) demonstrate that ER stress induces\n\nCREBH and CRP gene expression through ERRc in vitro.\nGSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERRc [4\u20138] that specifically\nbinds to ERRc and inhibits ERRc transcriptional activity, was\nused to verify this effect in vivo. As expected from previous results,\n\nwe noticed that GSK5182 treatment substantially reduced Tm-\n\ninduced CREBH-N and CRP protein levels in mouse liver\n\n(Fig. 5A). Moreover, ERRc protein levels were decreased upon\nTm+GSK treatment as compared to Tm alone. This might be due\nto the mechanism of autoregulatory feed forward loop that\n\nregulates ERRc gene expression [38]. Previous reports from our\nlaboratory demonstrated that acute alcohol consumption induces\n\nhepatic ERRc gene expression [8]. Mice were treated with EtOH\nto investigate whether ERRc induces CREBH-N and CRP gene\nexpression. The EtOH treatment significantly increased CREBH-\n\nN and CRP gene expression, along with ERRc. However,\nGSK5182 strongly inhibited both basal and alcohol-induced\n\nhepatic CREBH-N, and CRP protein expression in mice liver\n\n(Fig. 5B). Our laboratory reported previously that the diabetic\n\nobese condition (db/db mice), induces ERRc gene expression [6].\nA significant induction in CREBH-N and CRP protein levels were\n\nobserved under the same conditions. However, we observed that\n\nGSK5182 treatment substantially suppressed both CREBHN, and\n\nCRP protein levels in db/db mice liver in accordance with previous\n\nresults (Fig. 5C). Overall, we demonstrated that ERRc regulates\nCREBH gene expression in vitro and in vivo.\n\nDiscussion\n\nER stress activates the unfolded protein response to generate\n\nmultiple transcription factors that function in different cellular\n\nphenomena including chromatin remodeling [40\u201344]. Our results\n\nprovide direct evidence for a newly recognized function of ERRc\nduring transcriptional regulation of CREBH in response to ER\n\nstress, as well as in diabetic obese condition [38,11]. The\n\ncoactivator PGC1a plays a crucial role in this regulation.\nMoreover, chromatin remodeling during subsequent transcription\n\nevents was observed and provided a mechanistic basis for the\n\nERRc-mediated induction of CREBH under different physiolog-\nical conditions.\n\nWe reported previously that ERRc directly regulates ATF6a,\nan ER membrane-bound bZIP transcription factor, in response to\n\nER stress [38]. CREBH is also an ER membrane-bound bZIP\n\ntranscription factor that belongs to the same CREB3 family as\n\nATF6a [11]. Moreover, we reported an increase in CREBH\nmRNA level following ERRc overexpression, although not as\nmuch as that of ATF6a [38]. Hence, we investigated the role of\nERRc in the regulation of ER-bound transcription factor CREBH\nunder different physiological conditions including ER stress. We\n\nobserved significant enhancement of CREBH gene expression by\n\noverexpressing ERRc in vitro and in vivo. A six-fold increase in\nCREBH mRNA level was noticed along with a significant increase\n\nin the CREBH-N form in response to ERRc overexpression\n(Fig. 1). CREBH is regulated by nuclear receptor PPARa,\nHNF4a, and GR [36\u201337,15]; hence, our current findings further\nestablish the interconnection between nuclear receptors and ER\n\nmembrane-bound transcription factors.\n\nAccording to previous reports, ER stress activates both CREBH\n\nand ERRc gene expression [11,38]. As we observed CREBH gene\ninduction by ERRc (Fig. 1), we speculated that ERRc might be\ninvolved in ER stressmediated induction of CREBH. In fact,\n\nknockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly reduced ER stress-\ninduced CREBH mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2), further\n\nsupporting the ER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. It has been\nreported that ERRc activates target genes by directly binding to\nthe ERRE on the promoter of the target gene [38]. This led us to\n\nspeculate the presence of ERRE on the CREBH promoter, and\n\nwe identified a potential site (AGGTCA) on the CREBH promoter\n\nfor ERRc binding. The ChIP assay provided further crucial\nevidence and confirmed ERRc binding on the CREBH promoter\nunder ER stress. PGC1a is closely associated with ERRc\ntranscriptional activity [3]. Several lines of evidence have shown\n\nthat the transcriptional regulation of PDK4 expression by PGC1a\nis mediated by ERRa or ERRc [45]. In accordance with these\nprevious reports, occupancy of PGC1a on ERRE of the CREBH\npromoter was observed during ER stress, providing critical in vivo\n\nevidence indicating that PGC1a is a coactivator for ERRc. Gene\nrepression is often associated with decreased histone acetylation\n\n[39]. Chromatin remodeling also occurs during coactivator gene\n\ntranscription [46]. In agreement with previous reports, a\n\nsignificant increase in template-associated histone, H3, and H4\n\nacetylation was noticed (H3 and H4) at the ERRE on CREBH\n\npromoter following Tm treatment or ERRc overexpression,\nshowing the importance of chromatin remodeling during gene\n\ntranscription (Fig. 3). Overall, our findings reveal a novel\n\nmolecular mechanism employed by ERRc linking transactivation\nof ERRc [38] to CREBH gene expression. Along with past\nindications of a probable nuclear receptor/ER membrane-bound\n\ntranscription factor interconnection, these data raise the possibility\n\n(discussed further below) that ERRc may serve as a key mediator\nin ER stress-induced CREBH gene expression.\n\nCRP, a known marker for several pathological conditions\n\nincluding ER stress, is regulated by CREBH [11]. Besides being a\n\nmarker, CRP is an active mediator of endothelial dysfunction,\n\narterial thrombosis, and atherogenesis [24\u201325]. Numerous groups\n\nhave shown pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of CRP\n\nin vitro [25,47\u201348]. Transgenic expression of human CRP\n\nsuppresses endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and\n\nbioactivity following vascular injury [49]. Several lines of evidence\n\nsuggest that CRP is a modulator that drives direct biological effects\n\non vascular cells. CRP, at concentrations known to predict adverse\n\nvascular events, directly quenches the production of the NO, in\n\nRegulation of CREBH by ERRc\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342\n\n\n\npart, through a post-transcriptional effect on endothelial NO\n\nsynthase mRNA stability. Diminished NO bioactivity, in turn,\n\ninhibits angiogenesis, an important compensatory mechanism\n\nduring chronic ischemia [50]. CRP has also been implicated in\n\nglucose metabolism. CRP infusion induces an inflammatory\n\nresponse followed by increased norepinephrine and cortisol levels,\n\nwhich result in increased gluconeogenesis [51]. Our initial results\n\n(Figs. 1\u20133) linking ER stress to ERRc-mediated induction of\nCREBH, raise the possibility that ERRc might regulate CREBH\ntarget genes by regulating CREBH itself. ERRc significantly\ninduced CRP gene expression (Fig. 4), which further verifies the\n\nER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. Alcohol consumption induces\nhepatic ERRc expression [8]. ERRc gene expression increases in\nthe liver of db/db mice [6]. Moreover, ERRc along with CREBH\nare positive regulators of gluconeogenesis [6,15]. In agreement\n\nwith these previous reports, alcohol treatment significantly induced\n\nboth CREBH and CRP gene expression, and this augmentation\n\nwas substantially compromised upon ERRc inhibition in vivo\n(Fig. 5B). Regulation of CREBH by ERRc was further established\nwhen GSK5182 treatment significantly reduced CREBH and its\n\ntarget gene, CRP, expression in db/db mice liver tissue (Fig. 5C).\n\nERRc, CREBH, and CRP are implicated in numerous\nbiological events. ERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis [6]\nand hepatic lipid metabolism [7]. CREBH positively regulates\n\nhepatic gluconeogenesis [15]. In addition, CREBH is a master\n\nregulator of the lipin 1 gene, a key regulator of lipid metabolism\n\n[17]. Both CREBH and ERRc gene expression is enhanced in a\n\ndiabetic mouse model to increase blood glucose level [15,6].\n\nRegulation of both factors is important to regulate gluconeogenesis\n\nin response to ER stress, and diabetes. Because the regulation of\n\nCRP is also very critical to maintain glucose homeostasis as well as\n\nother cellular phenomena including angiogenesis, inhibiting\n\nCREBH transactivity and CRP gene expression by inhibiting\n\nERRc through GSK5182 could be important to relieve disease\nsymptoms. As depicted in Fig. 5D, we hypothesize that ERRc\ndirectly binds to the CREBH promoter along with coactivator\n\nPGC1a to regulate CREBH at the transcriptional level in response\nto ER stress and other physiological conditions, and that CREBH,\n\nin turn, regulates its target genes. Overall, our current findings\n\nprovide insight into a novel chromatin remodeling strategy utilized\n\nby ERRc, and it may be helpful to understand the complex link\nbetween nuclear receptors, ER membrane-bound transcription\n\nfactors, and glucose homeostasis.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank our lab members for technical assistance, Kezhong\n\nZhang for providing us with CRP promoter.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: JM HSC.

It is known that autoantibodies can enter viable cells and this\nphenomenon has functional consequences including activation of apoptotic process. The objective of this work was to explore whether autoan-\ntibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera trigger apoptotic process in an experimental model represented by the human salivary gland\ncell line A-253. To define if the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways are activated, we examined which caspases are critical for inducing cell death.\nThe results have demonstrated that morphological changes and DNA laddering, consistent with apoptotic cell death, occurred in A-253 cells\ntreated with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren sera. Sjo\u0308gren IgG induced cleavage and activation of the effector caspase-3 and degradation of the caspase-3\nsubstrate poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated, since both caspase-8 and caspase-9\ncleavages occurred. In conclusion, autoantibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera mediate apoptosis of the A-253 cell line in a\ncaspase-dependent manner.\n\ufffd 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

S syndrome is an autoimmune rheumatic disease\nthat targets salivary and lachrymal glands, leading to glandu-\nlar atrophy characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and\nxerostomia [7e9]. SS may occur alone, defined as primary\nSS, or in association with other autoimmune diseases, such\nas rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\nor scleroderma, when it is defined as secondary SS [10].\n\nAlthough there is a high correlation between the pres-\nence of serum autoantibodies and the development of SS,\nit is still unclear why cellular components, participating\n\nmailto:m.sisto@anatomia.uniba.it\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/08968411\n\n\n39M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nin important biosynthetic and structural functions, are tar-\ngeted for autoimmune reactions, and the exact role of these\nantibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain.\n\nThe association of apoptosis with autoantibodies produc-\ntion is of recent interest, in fact numerous diseases of definite\nor possible autoimmune aetiology have lately been shown to\ndisplay abnormalities in apoptosis [11]. Apoptosis or pro-\ngrammed cell death (PCD) is a physiological process that as-\nsures cellular exchange; this natural machinery eliminates the\napoptotic material present in blebs and apoptotic bodies [12].\nStudies performed over the last years have demonstrated that\nthe caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent, aspartate-\ndirected proteases, play a critical role in the initiation and\nexecution of apoptosis [13]. Caspases are synthesized as\ninactive zymogens that become activated by cleavage via\nupstream proteases and, once activated, lead to cell death\nvia two distinct caspase-dependent pathways. The first\ninvolves the death receptor, or extrinsic pathway, which is\ninitiated by TNF-receptor family members and involves the\nactivation of initiator caspase-8 and/or caspase-10. The alter-\nnative intrinsic pathway, dependent on Fas and various cell\nstress stimuli, triggers the cell death process via mitochon-\ndrial release of Cytochrome c and the activation of initiator\ncaspase-9. The active forms of caspase-8 and caspase-9\ncleave and activate the downstream effectors caspase-3,\ncaspase-6, and caspase-7 [14e16]. Once activated, caspases\ncleave a variety of intracellular polypeptides of cytoplasmic\nand nuclear localization, such as poly(ADP-ribose)polymer-\nase (PARP) and these scissions disrupt survival pathways\nand disassemble architectural components of the cell, contrib-\nuting to the morphological and biochemical changes that\ncharacterize apoptotic cell death. Data in literature have dem-\nonstrated that in autoimmune conditions the caspases are over\nactivated [17] and the tolerance is broken by different factors,\nincluding an inappropriate removal of apoptotic material.\nThis impairment promotes an antigen-driven response against\nintracellular antigens [18]. In the past few years, the expres-\nsion of the apoptosis-regulating protein in the salivary glands\nof SS patients has been reported, suggesting a role for apo-\nptotic cell death in the pathogenesis of glandular damage in\nthis autoimmune disease [19]. Several authors have demon-\nstrated that in SS there is an increased apoptosis of salivary\ngland epithelium, together with the expression of Fas and\nFasL, suggesting the induction of PCD through a classic\nFaseFasL interaction [17]. In addition, in SS the glandular\nepithelium is increasingly sensitive to apoptosis, in contrast\nto the resistance to PCD exhibited by the infiltrating glandu-\nlar lymphocytes [17,20]. At present, the mechanisms underly-\ning the glandular tissue destruction observed in SS patients\nare not fully understood. Our goal in this research was to\ndemonstrate that, in an experimental model represented by\nthe human salivary gland cell line A-253, autoantibodies con-\ntained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera directed against cel-\nlular antigens trigger the apoptotic process. In addition, by\nexamining which caspases are critical for inducing cell death,\nwe show that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic path-\nways are activated.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. A-253 cell culture\n\nA-253 cells from human epidermoid carcinoma of the sub-\nmaxillary gland (American Type Culture Collection, number:\nHTB-41) were cultured in McCoy\u2019s 5a modified medium\n(GIBCO, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bo-\nvine serum (FBS; SIGMA, MO, USA), 1% (v/v) antibiotic so-\nlution (100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin)\n(SIGMA), 2 mM L-glutamine (SIGMA) and incubated in a\nhumidified 5% CO2e95% air incubator at 37\n\n\ufffdC.\n\n2.2. Patients and controls\n\nSera were obtained from nine healthy volunteers and nine\npatients with primary Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome, all fulfilling the\nAmericaneEuropean Consensus Group Classification criteria\nfor SS [1]. None of the patients examined met the clinical or\nserological criteria for additional connective tissue disease.\nNone of the patients suffered from acute viral or bacterial in-\nfections at the time of the study. Informed consent for studies\ninvolving human subjects was obtained and the studies were\nconducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\n\n2.3. Preparation and purification of human IgG\n\nIgG was obtained from Sjo\u0308gren and healthy sera by precip-\nitation with ammonium sulphate at 50% (w/v), followed by\nthree washes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and repreci-\npitation with 33% (w/v) ammonium sulphate. The resulting\nprecipitate was submitted to dialysis against phosphate buffer,\npH 7.4, at 4 \ufffdC overnight. Subsequently, IgG was purified on\nprotein G Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden)\nas recommended by the manufacturer. The IgG containing\neluates, spectrophotometrically evaluated (l\u00bc 280), were\nconcentrated to 20 mg/ml.\n\n2.4. ELISA autoantibodies\u2019 tests\n\nThe nine Sjo\u0308gren and healthy sera, processed to obtain IgG\nfractions, were chosen submitting them to indirect solid phase\nenzyme immunoassays to detect autoantibodies against nu-\nclear protein SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La) (ENA combi, ELISA\nkit, DIAMEDIX, FL, USA), autoantibodies against nuclear\nantigens SSA-52 (Ro 52), SSA-60 (Ro 60), SSB (La), RNP/\nSm, RNP-70 Kd, RNP-A, RNP-C, Sm-BB0, Sm-D, Sm-E,\nSm-F, Sm-G, Scl-70, Jo-1, dsDNA, ssDNA, poly-nucleosome,\nmono-nucleosome, histone-complex, Histone H1, Histone\nH2A, Histone H2B, Histone H3, Histone H4, PM-Scl-100,\nCentromere B (ANA Detect ELISA kit, DIAMEDIX, FL,\nUSA), and autoantibodies directed against the cytoskeletal\nprotein a-fodrin (Anti-Alpha Fodrin detection kit, DIAME-\nDIX). Briefly, prediluted controls and patient samples were\nplaced in microtiter plates precoated with the above-\nmentioned antigens. After 30 min incubation at room\n\n\n\n40 M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\ntemperature, an HRP-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin\nG was added to each well to detect specific autoantibodies con-\ntained in the control and patient sera. The same bioassay was\nused for the detection of autoantibodies in the control and patient\nIgG fractions. The colorimetric reaction was performed using\ntetramethylbenzidine, a chromogenic substrate oxidised by\nHRP. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the\noptical density was measured at 450 nm with an automated\nmicroplate reader. The amount of colour was directly propor-\ntional to the concentration of autoantibodies present in samples.\n\n2.5. Internalization of autoantibody by\nimmunofluorescence\n\nThe internalization of SS IgG by A-253 cells was studied\nby fluorescence microscopy. The A-253 cells (1\ufffd 106 cells/\nwell) were distributed in well microculture plates (Nunc, Den-\nmark) in which a 175-mm cellocate glass (Eppendorf, Ger-\nmany) had been previously placed. The cells were incubated\nwith SS IgG (200 mg/ml) at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h. After washing\nwith PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformalde-\nhyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v)\nTriton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The fixed cells were then in-\ncubated with goat anti-human IgG-FITC antibody (sc-2456;\n1:200; from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) at room\ntemperature for 40 min. Intracellular IgG were observed under\na fluorescence microscope. To confirm the internalization of\nautoantibodies cells were pretreated for 2 h with cytochalasin\nD (15 mg/ml) and then treated with SS IgG for 2 h at 37 \ufffdC.\nHealthy IgG were used as control.\n\n2.6. A-253 cell treatment\n\nTo evaluate the apoptosis, cell cultures were subjected to\ndifferent treatments as follows: (1) treatment with IgG fractions\n(200 mg/ml) purified from healthy sera (H IgG) for 48 h; (2)\ntreatment with IgG fractions (200 mg/ml) purified from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera (SS IgG) for 48 h; (3) treatment with IgG (200 mg/ml) pu-\nrified from healthy sera for 48 h after pre-incubation for 2 h\nwith cytochalasin D (SIGMA) (15 mg/ml) an agent disrupting\ncytoskeletal filaments; and (4) treatment for 48 h with IgG pu-\nrified from Sjo\u0308gren sera (200 mg/ml) after pre-incubation for\n2 h with cytochalasin D (15 mg/ml). Controls included both un-\ntreated cells and cells incubated for 48 h with the pro-apoptotic\nagent actinomycin D (SIGMA) (5 mg/ml).\n\n2.7. Determination of apoptosis\n\n2.7.1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of A-253\ncell apoptosis\n\nTo detect apoptotic cells, the Vibrant Apoptosis assay kit\n(Molecular Probes, Inc., OR, USA) was employed. This assay\nuses the green fluorescent non-permeant nuclear dye YO-\nPRO-1 that is able to enter apoptotic cells and propidium\niodide (PI), that stains necrotic cells. After incubation on ice\nfor 20 min, the cells were immediately observed under fluores-\ncence microscopy using a green reference filter (l\u00bc 490 nm)\nfor YO-PRO-1 and a red reference filter (l\u00bc 530 nm) for PI.\nApoptotic cells appear green-stained, necrotic cells appear\nred-stained, viable cells show little or no fluorescence. To de-\ntermine the optimum concentration of Sjo\u0308gren IgG to employ\nin the experimental procedure, the same YO-PRO-1 assay was\nused. The A-253 cells were treated with growing concentra-\ntions of SS IgG (10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/ml) for 48 h. The\nA-253 cells treated with the same concentrations of healthy\nIgG were used as control. The percentage of apoptotic cells\nwas determined by counting at least 100 cells.\n\n2.7.2. DNA fragmentation of A-253 cell line\nDegradation of the A-253 cell line DNA was used as an in-\n\ndex of apoptosis. A-253 (107) cells from each treatment were\nwashed in PBS and lysed in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA,\n1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. Then 1 ml of DNA-\nzol (Molecular Research Center Inc., OH, USA) was added to\ncells in the presence of proteinase K (100 mg/ml) for 30 min at\n37 \ufffdC. After centrifugation at 11 000\ufffd g for 20 min at 10 \ufffdC,\nthe supernatant was collected and RNAse A (20 mg/ml) was\nadded for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC, in order to eliminate contaminating\nRNA. The DNA extracted was precipitated in 100% (v/v) eth-\nanol and centrifuged at 11 000\ufffd g for 20 min. Purified DNA\nwas dissolved in 8 mM NaOH, separated by electrophoresis\nin a 2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide\nstaining.\n\n2.7.3. Caspase-3 activation analysis\nActive caspase-3 enzyme is a heterodimer composed of two\n\n17 kDa and two 11 kDa subunits derived from a 32-kDa pro-\nenzyme (pro-caspase-3) by cleavage at multiple aspartic acid\nsites. The caspase-3 precursor is firstly cleaved to produce\nthe p11 subunit and the 20 kDa (p20) peptide. Subsequently,\nthe p20 peptide is cleaved to generate the mature p17 subunit\n[21]. We adopted two different approaches to visualize the\nintracellular activation of caspase-3 during the apoptotic\nprocess, immunofluorescence and enzymatic assays. In the\nimmunofluorescence assay, treated A-253 cells were fixed\nfor 10 min in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde diluted in PBS plus\n0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. After treatment with 0.2% (w/v) bo-\nvine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 10 min to minimize\nnon-specific absorption of antibodies, the coverslips were in-\ncubated, for 45 min at room temperature, with the rabbit\nanti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (pAb; 80806E; 1:1500;\nPharmingen, Germany), specific for the 17 kDa subunit, and\nfor 30 min with the bovine anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (sc-2365;\n1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, the slides were\nmounted and examined under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nThe enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in lysates of A-253\ncells was evaluated using the CaspACE\ufffd colorimetric assay\nsystem (Promega Corporation, WI, USA). This assay is based\non the recognition of specific amino acid sequences by\ncaspase-3 and the proteolytic cleavage of DEVD-pNA by\ncaspase-3 into the chromophore p-nitroanline ( p-NA). Briefly,\nA-253 cells, treated as described in Section 2.6, were har-\nvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then lysed\nwith a cell lysis buffer, according to the manufacturer\u2019s\n\n\n\n41M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\ninstructions. The amount of total proteins extracted was quan-\ntified by Bradford\u2019s method [22] and equal amounts (50 mg) of\nproteins from the total cell lysate were used in the assay. Pro-\ntein lysates were transferred to a flat-bottomed microtitre plate\nand the reaction buffer plus the caspase-3 substrate DEVD (N-\nacetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde)-pNA were added. After 4 h\nof incubation at 37 \ufffdC, the caspase-3 activity was detected by\nmeasurement of the free p-nitroaniline ( p-Na), released by\ncleavage of the substrate, in an absorbance spectrophotometer\nat 405 nm. To assess the specificity of the reaction, the com-\npetitive inhibitor of caspase-3, Z-VAD-FMK [valylalanylas-\npartic acid (VAD) fluoromethyl ketone (FMK), 20 mM] was\nadded to the samples. The results are expressed as mean\ufffd SE\nof nine experiments performed in duplicate.\n\n2.7.4. Determination of caspases-8 and caspase-9\nenzymatic activity\n\nTo distinguish between the two major pathways of caspase\nactivation possibly induced by autoantibodies from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera, we evaluated caspases-8 and caspase-9 activity in A-\n253 cells submitted to the treatments as indicated above.\nThe caspase-8 and caspase-9 colorimetric protease assay kits\n(BioSource International Inc., CA, USA) were used.\n\nCaspase-8, involved in the extrinsic pathway of caspase\nactivation, exists in cells as a 55-kDa proprotein which is\nactivated to produce p18/p17 subunits. The caspase-8 precur-\nsor is firstly cleaved to produce the p17 subunit and the p20\npeptide. Subsequently, the p20 peptide is cleaved to generate\nthe mature p18 subunit. Caspase-9, activated in the intrinsic\npathway of programmed cell death, exists in cells as an inac-\ntive 46 kDa proenzyme which is cleaved to active 35 and\n10 kDa subunits [21]. The kits are able to assay the amount\nof active caspase-8, that recognizes the IETD (Ile-Glu-Thr-\nAsp) amino acid sequence, and the amount of active cas-\npase-9 that recognizes the LEHD (Leu-Glu-His-Asp) amino\nacid sequence. These amino acid sequences correspond to\ncleavage sites of the inactive 32 kDa caspase-3 precursor.\nThe tests include a substrate for active caspase-8, IETD-\npNA, composed of the chromophore p-nitroaniline ( p-NA)\nand a synthetic tetrapeptide IETD, and a substrate for active\ncaspase-9, LEHD-pNA, composed of the chromophore p-ni-\ntroaniline ( p-NA) and a synthetic tetrapeptide LEHD. Briefly,\ntreated cells (5\ufffd 106) were lysed with 50 ml of the cell lysis\nbuffer, followed by freezing and thawing cycles. For the assay,\n100 mg of protein lysates was mixed with caspase assay\nbuffers in a 96-well microtiter plate. Then, IETD-pNA or\nLEHD-pNA substrates were added to the wells and the micro-\nplate was incubated at 37 \ufffdC for 2 h in the dark. Upon cleav-\nage of the substrate by active caspase-8 or caspase-9, free p-\nNA light absorbance was quantified using a microplate reader\nat l\u00bc 405 nm. Comparison of the absorbance of p-NA from\napoptotic samples or control samples allowed the determina-\ntion of caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity.\n\n2.7.5. Western blot analysis\nThe total cellular content of active caspase-3, caspase-8,\n\ncaspase-9 and of the substrate of active caspase-3, PARP,\nwas analysed by western blot. A-253 cells, treated as in Sec-\ntion 2.6, were washed twice, detached with ice-cold PBS, col-\nlected and centrifuged at 600\ufffd g for 10 min. The supernatant\nwas removed and the pellet was incubated with lysis buffer\n[1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mM TriseHCl, 137 mM NaCl,\n10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsul-\nfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 mM leupeptin hemisulfate salt,\nand 0.2 U/ml aprotinin] for 30 min on ice. After incubation,\nthe obtained lysate was vortexed and then centrifuged at\n12 800\ufffd g for 10 min; the protein concentration in the super-\nnatant was spectrophotometrically determined by Bradford\u2019s\nprotein assay, and the lysate was subjected to sodium dodecyl\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Pro-\ntein samples were diluted with sample buffer (0.5 M TriseHCl\npH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% w/v SDS, 5%(v/v) b2-mer-\ncaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and then\nboiled for 3 min. Proteins (25 mg/lane) and prestained stan-\ndards (BioRad Laboratories, CA, USA) were loaded on 10%\n(PARP) or 15% (all proteins except PARP) SDS-polyacryl-\namide precast gels. All the experiments were carried out in du-\nplicate. After electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were\ntransferred from gel onto nitrocellulose membranes. A blot\nbuffer [20 mM Tris/150 mM glycine, pH 8, 20% (v/v) metha-\nnol] was used for gel and membrane saturation and blot. The\nblot conditions were the following: 200 mA (constant amper-\nage), 200 V for 110 min. After the transfer to nitrocellulose,\nequal loading of each lane was confirmed by Ponceau S stain-\ning. Blots were then blocked by PBS, pH 7.2, with 0.1% (v/v)\nTween-20, 5% w/v non-fat dried milk for 1 h and washed\nthree times with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20ePBS 1\ufffd (TePBS).\nMembranes were then incubated for 90 min with goat anti-\ncaspase-3 pAb (sc-1225; 1:500), rabbit anti-PARP pAb\n(sc-7150; 1:500), rabbit anti-caspase-9 (sc-8355; 1:200), rabbit\nanti-caspase-8 (sc-7890; 1:500); all pAbs from Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology. Bound Ab were visualized with bovine anti-\nrabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2370; 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)\nor rabbit anti-goat IgG-HRP (sc-2768; 1:5000; Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology). Bands were visualized by 3,30-diaminobenzi-\ndine tetrahydrochloride (Fast DAB, SIGMA). The beta (b)-\nactin protein level was determined by western blot and used\nas a protein loading control.\n\n2.8. Statistics\n\nThe data were analysed for normality using the Wilks\nShapiro Test. Differences in means for paired observations\nwere analysed by Student\u2019s t-test. In all instances values of\np< 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Antibodies detected in Sjo\u0308gren IgG fractions\n\nThe Sjo\u0308gren sera and the SS IgG fractions resulted positive\nfor the presence of anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, anti-nuclear anti-\ngens.

Antibodies internalization by the A-253 cells\n\nTo examine the uptake of Sjo\u0308gren IgG by A-253 cells after\n2 h incubation, an immunofluorescence assay was performed\nusing a goat anti-human IgG-FITC antibody. The cells treated\nwith SS IgG (Fig. 1A) showed an higher fluorescence, located\nin the cytoplasm or inside the nucleus, than control cells,\ntreated with healthy IgG (Fig. 1B), that showed a low fluores-\ncence signal distributed in a homogeneous manner inside the\ncells. Pretreatment with cytochalasin D blocked the SS IgG\n(Fig. 1C) and the healthy IgG internalization (data not shown).\nCells treated with the goat anti-human IgG-FITC antibody\nalone did not show any fluorescence and, at the same time,\nFig. 1.

Effect of Sjo\u0308gren IgG concentration on A-253\ncells apoptosis\n\nThe nuclear morphology of A-253 cells, treated with grow-\ning concentrations of Sjo\u0308gren IgG, was analysed by the Vy-\nbrant Apoptosis assay kit. Fig. 2 shows the percentage of\napoptotic A-253 cells at different concentrations of Sjo\u0308gren\nIgG. When the concentration of 200 mg/ml was used the per-\ncentage of apoptotic cells was 82\ufffd 3.2.

Morphological analysis of apoptotic A-253 cells\n\nFor analysis of the nuclear morphology, A-253 cells,\nstained with the Vybrant Apoptosis assay kit, were observed\nunder fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, the per-\ncentage of apoptotic A-253 cells treated with IgG purified\nfrom Sjo\u0308gren sera (78.9\ufffd 0.7) was significantly higher\n( p< 0.01) than the percentage of apoptotic cells observed in\nuntreated control cells (1.2\ufffd 0.1). No significant difference\n( p> 0.05) was revealed between the percentage of apoptotic\nA-253 cells treated with IgG purified from healthy sera\n(1.3\ufffd 0.1) and control cells (1.2\ufffd 0.1).\n\n3.5. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce DNA\nfragmentation\n\nDNA fragmentation analysis in A-253 cells treated as de-\nscribed in Section 2 yielded these results: DNA fragmentation\nwas observed in cells treated with the pro-apoptotic agent ac-\ntinomycin D, as in cells treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera. Moreover, SS IgG-induced DNA fragmentation was pre-\nvented by preliminary treatment with cytochalasin D. No DNA\nfragmentation was observed in untreated control cells and in\ncells treated with IgG purified from healthy donors (Fig. 4).\n\n3.6. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce caspase-3\nactivation\n\nIn the immunofluorescence assay, the cells in which\ncaspase-3 was activated appeared green-stained. Active\ncaspase-3 was observed in actinomycin D-treated A-253 cells\n\nFig. 4. SS IgG induce DNA laddering in A-253 cells. The cells were treated\n\nwith IgG purified from healthy sera (lane H IgG), IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren\n\nsera (lane SS IgG), cytochalasin D plus healthy IgG (lane H IgG\u00feCyt D), cy-\ntochalasin D plus Sjo\u0308gren IgG (lane SS IgG\u00feCyt D). Untreated cells (lane C)\nand cells treated with actinomycin D (lane Act) were used as control. The\n\nmolecular weight standard was run in lane M. DNA from these cells was\n\nextracted and analysed by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n\n\n44 M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nFig. 5. Fluorescence microscopy of A-253 cells stained with rabbit anti-caspase-3 pAb using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated bovine anti-rabbit IgG\n\nas detection antibody. A-253 untreated control cells (A) and cells treated with IgG purified from healthy donors sera (C) did not show intracellular caspase-3 ac-\n\ntivation. Actinomycin D-treated A-253 cells (B) and cells treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera (D) showed intracellular activation of caspase-3 (in the\n\nfigure, green-stained cells appear white). Scale bar\u00bc 10 mm. The results are representative of nine experiments.\n(Fig. 5B) and in cells treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren\nsera (Fig. 5D). By contrast, A-253 untreated control cells\n(Fig. 5A) and cells treated with IgG purified from healthy\nsera (Fig. 5C) did not show intracellular caspase-3 activation.\nMoreover, pretreatment with cytochalasin D prevented\ncaspase-3 activation induced by SS IgG cell treatment (data\nnot shown).\n\nFig. 6 shows the active caspase-3 proteolytic activity mea-\nsured by the CaspACE\ufffd colorimetric assay system. A signif-\nicantly higher ( p< 0.01) caspase-3 enzymatic activity was\nobserved in A-253 cells treated with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren sera\nin comparison with untreated control cells. No significant dif-\nferences in caspase-3 activity were observed between A-253\ncells treated with IgG from healthy sera and untreated control\nsera ( p> 0.05). A significant ( p< 0.01) reduction in caspase-\n3 enzymatic activity was observed when A-253 cells were\npretreated with cytochalasin D and then with SS IgG in com-\nparison with cells treated with SS IgG alone. The specificity\nof the reaction, assessed using the competitive inhibitor of\ncaspase-3, Z-VAD-FMK was reliable because treatment with\nthis substance blocked DEVD-pNA cleavage (data not\nshown).\n3.7. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce activation of\nboth caspase-8 and caspase-9\n\nFig. 7 shows the active caspase-8 (Fig. 7A) and the active\ncaspase-9 (Fig. 7B) proteolytic activity measured by the\ncaspase-8 and caspase-9 colorimetric protease assay kits. A-253\ncells treatment with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera led to\nthe activation of both of these caspases, involved in different\napoptotic pathways. In fact, a significantly higher ( p< 0.01)\ncaspase-8 enzymatic activity was observed in IgG from\nSjo\u0308gren sera-treated A-253 cells in comparison with untreated\ncontrol cells. No significant differences in caspase-8 activity\nwere observed between A-253 cells treated with IgG from\nhealthy sera and untreated control sera ( p> 0.05). A signifi-\ncant ( p< 0.01) reduction in caspase-8 enzymatic activity\nwas observed when A-253 cells were treated with cytochalasin\nD plus SS IgG, in comparison with cells treated with SS IgG\nalone. The same results were observed for caspase-9 activa-\ntion, in fact, SS IgG treatment of A-253 cell line led to the ac-\ntivation of caspase-9, and the enzymatic activity of caspase-9\nwas significantly higher ( p< 0.01) than in untreated control\ncells and cells treated with H IgG. Moreover, caspase-9\n\n\n\n45M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nactivation following SS IgG treatment was significantly\n( p< 0.01) reduced when cytochalasin D was used.\n\n3.8. IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera induce proteolytic\ncleavage of initiator and executor caspases\n\nCleavage of the initiator caspases-8 and caspase-9 and of\nthe effector caspase-3 and active caspase-3 substrate, PARP,\nwas analysed by western blot. Western blot analysis of\ncaspase-3 protein activation was performed using the anti-\ncaspase-3 antibody, specific for peptide mapping at the\nC-terminus of the caspase-3 subunit p20, as a probe. The\nantibody recognizes both the caspase-3 precursor and\nthe active caspase-3 subunit p20. The presence of the\n20 kDa band was evaluated in A-253 untreated control cells\nand in cells treated with actinomycin D, IgG purified from\nSjo\u0308gren sera, and IgG purified from healthy sera. The band\ncorresponding to the p20 subunit detected in actinomycin\nD-treated cells was evident in SS IgG-treated cells as well.\nOnly the caspase-3 precursor was detectable in untreated con-\ntrol cells and in cells treated with H IgG (Fig. 8 panel A). To\nconfirm caspase-3 activation, the expression of the 89 kDa\nfragment of PARP, resulting from cleavage of endogenous\n116 kDa PARP by active caspase-3, was analysed. In A-253\ncontrol cells and in cells treated with IgG from healthy do-\nnors, the full length 116 kDa PARP was expressed. Treatment\nof A-253 with actinomycin D and with IgG from Sjo\u0308gren\npatients induced the cleavage of the full length PARP in the\n89 kDa subunit (Fig. 8 panel B). Western blot analysis of\nthe caspase-8 protein activation was performed using the\nanti-caspase-8 antibody, specific for the p20 subunit, which\nis able to recognize both the inactive pro-caspase-8 and the\nactive p20 fragment. Pro-caspase-9 cleavage was revealed\nusing the anti-caspase-9 antibody, specific for the p35 active\nsubunit. As shown in Fig. 9, SS IgG treatment induced\npro-caspase-8 (Fig. 9 panel A) and pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 9 panel\n\ncaspase-3 assay\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nC Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+\nCyt D\n\nSS IgG+\nCyt D \n\nc\na\ns\np\n\na\ns\ne\n-\n3\n \na\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\nFig. 6.

Discussion\n\nThis study was undertaken to determine whether autoanti-\nbodies against several antigens contained in IgG purified\nfrom Sjo\u0308gren sera trigger apoptosis in human salivary gland\ncell line A-253. Our findings demonstrate that in A-253 cells\nautoantibodies induce (1) the activation of both the intrinsic\nand the extrinsic apoptotic pathways; (2) then the cleavage\nand activation of effector caspase-3; and, finally, (3) morpho-\nlogical changes typical of apoptosis. On the contrary, IgG\npurified from healthy sera have no effects on A-253 cells.\n\nThe ability of some autoantibodies to enter viable cells and\nreact with cellular antigens is accepted from several authors.\nIn varying experimental models, both in vitro and in vivo, it\n\nA\n\nB\n\ncaspase-8 assay\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nC Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+\nCyt D\n\nSS IgG+\nCyt D\n\nc\na\ns\np\n\na\ns\ne\n-\n8\n \na\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\ncaspase-9 assay\n\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\nC Act H IgG SS IgG H IgG+\nCyt D\n\nSS IgG+\nCyt D\n\nc\na\ns\np\n\na\ns\ne\n-\n9\n \na\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n\nFig. 7.

Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nhas been proven that antibodies to intracellular constituents\ncan enter living cell types from many tissues, causing various\nfunctional alterations [23e36]. Autoantibodies that penetrate\nlive cells include polyclonal and monoclonal anti-DNA\n[24,37e39], anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) [23,40], anti-Ro\n[41,42], anti-La [43], anti-proteinase 3 [44], anti-synaptosomal\n[45], anti-neuronal [46,47], anti-ribosomal protein P [48], and\nanti-a-fodrin [49], a gene protein product of recent identifica-\ntion. In particular, it has been reported that polyclonal IgG\nanti-RNP isolated from autoimmune patients penetrate live hu-\nman peripheral blood mononuclear cells [40,23], keratinocytes\n[50] and epithelial cells [38]. Furthermore, human polyclonal\nanti-DNA IgG isolated from systemic lupus erythematosus\nserum penetrate and localize in the cell nucleus of peripheral\nblood T lymphocytes [28,51,52], human and murine renal\ntubular cells [53].\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been investigated for the penetra-\ntion of autoantibodies [23,53e55]; it has been proposed that\ndifferent antibodies may preferentially use distinct penetration\npathways [27,53], including the engagement of Fc receptors\non cells, originally described by Alarco\u0301n-Segovia et al. [23],\nor the cross-reaction of antibodies with proteins located on\nor near the cell surface such as myosin 1, a 110-kDa cell sur-\nface receptor, in the case of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies\n[56e58].\n\nSeveral findings suggest that there is a relationship between\nthe binding and penetration of autoantibodies into different\ncell types and the initiation of events leading to various func-\ntional cellular alterations. Autoantibodies can thereby modify\ncell functions, arrest the progression of the cell cycle and ab-\nrogate the expression of some genes [33]. One of the most in-\nteresting effects of autoantibody penetration is the induction of\nprogrammed cell death [24,28,35,46,47].\n\nFig. 8. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in A-253 cells. Cell lysates\n\nof A-253 cells were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE (15% for caspase-3\n\nand 10% for PARP) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for west-\n\nern blot analysis. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies for caspase-3\n\n(panel A), PARP (panel B) and b-actin (panel C). Act, actinomycin D-treated\n\ncells; C, untreated control cells; H IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from\n\nhealthy sera; SS IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera.\n\nGrowing evidence suggests that the deregulation of apopto-\n\nsis is involved in autoimmunity. Autoimmune diseases are\ncharacterized by aberrations in the repertoire of lymphocytes\nthat infiltrate target organs in response to autoantigens arising\nfrom inappropriate apoptosis of target cells [59]. Often, the\npresence of autoreactive lymphocytes is involved in the pro-\ngression of the autoimmune diseases triggered by autoanti-\nbodies\u2019 penetration [60e62]. Numerous investigations have\nfocused on the role of CD95/Fas in organ-specific autoimmu-\nnity as shown in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis [63], Grave\u2019s disease\n[64], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [65] and systemic\nlupus erythematosus [66]. In SLE there is evidence of an\nincrease of the soluble Fas mediator, that would inhibit the\napoptotic process, but this feedback is not absolutely decisive\nfor autoimmune cell survival, because a high level of lympho-\ncyte apoptosis was concurrently found [67].\n\nRecently, research advances have supported the idea that,\nonce they have penetrated cells, autoantibodies can be directly\npathogenic and directly trigger the apoptotic pathway, depend-\ning on their antigen specificity [68]. Shiraga and Adamus\nshowed that anti-retinal autoantibodies of the paraneoplastic\nretinopathy syndrome, specific to recoverin and to enolase,\nbut not normal antibodies, can induce activation of the apopto-\ntic process via the intrinsic pathway in living retinal cells [69].\nFurthermore, DNA-specific autoantibodies can enter cultured\nmesangial cells [70], endothelial cells [71], and lymphoid cells\n[33], causing apoptosis.\n\nApoptosis also seems to play a central role in the pathogen-\nesis of Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome. S syndrome has been demon-\nstrated to proceed along two pathological phases: an early\nphase in which the salivary and lachrymal tissues undergo in-\nappropriate PCD and a later phase of lymphocyte infiltration\nand autoimmune aggression, in which further progressive\nglandular destruction and functional disability occur [72].\n\nFig. 9. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in A-253 cells. Cell\n\nlysates of A-253 cells were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) and\n\ntransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for western blot analysis. Blots\n\nwere probed with polyclonal antibodies for caspase-8 (panel A), caspase-9\n\n(panel B) and b-actin (panel C). Act, actinomycin D-treated cells; C, untreated\n\ncontrol cells; H IgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from healthy sera; SS\n\nIgG, A-253 treated with IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera.\n\n\n\n47M. Sisto et al. / Journal of Autoimmunity 27 (2006) 38e49\nApoptotic death in SS may be mediated through the tumor ne-\ncrosis factor-alpha receptor [73], CD95 [74,75] or the perforin\npathway [3]. Recent observations have detected increased pro-\nteolytic activity in salivary epithelial cells, including that of\nthe caspases, enzymes involved in the intracellular PCD, sup-\nporting the concept that excessive cell death contributes to the\npathogenesis of this disease [76].\n\nAt present, in Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome, there are no evidences\nof any correlation between autoantibody penetration of sali-\nvary epithelial cells and a direct role in causing apoptosis. In\nthis report, we demonstrate that, in our experimental model\nrepresented by a human salivary gland cell line A-253, autoan-\ntibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera, once\npenetrated into cells, are able to trigger cell death through\napoptotic mechanisms.\n\nUsing YO-PRO-1 staining, we observed morphological\nchanges consistent with apoptotic cell death in A-253 cells\ntreated with SS IgG. DNA fragmentation into variable length\noligonucleosomal fragments is one of the typical features of\napoptosis. Characteristic DNA laddering, observed in A-253\ncells treated with SS IgG, confirmed cellular apoptosis. Inhibi-\ntion of autoantibody internalization, by blocking endocytosis\nusing cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts cytoskeletal fila-\nments, conserved the DNA integrity. In addition, to distinguish\nbetween the two major pathways of caspase activation, we\nevaluated caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 proteolytic\ncleavage and activation in A-253 cells treated with SS IgG.\nIn A-253 cells, the treatment with SS IgG-induced cleavage\nand activation of effector caspase-3, a key and pivotal execu-\ntioner protease, confirmed by cleavage of caspase-3 substrate\npoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) that is cleaved and inac-\ntivated when caspase-3 is activated. Colorimetric and western\nblot analyses demonstrated that both the intrinsic and extrinsic\npathways were activated, since both caspase-8 and caspase-9\ncleavage occurred. Pretreatment of A-253 cells with cytocha-\nlasin D inhibited caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 cleavage\nand activation, confirming that this effect was caused by auto-\nantibody penetration. In the same experimental condition, IgG\npurified from sera of healthy donors did not have the apoptotic\neffect that SS IgG had.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that autoantibodies contained\nin IgG purified from Sjo\u0308gren sera mediate apoptosis of a sali-\nvary gland cell line in a caspase-dependent manner, in which\nboth the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways play a role. This may\nbe an important step towards finding more appropriate mea-\nsures for the treatment of Sjo\u0308gren\u2019s syndrome. A better under-\nstanding of the events responsible for the glandular damage\noccurring in this autoimmune disease may allow new thera-\npeutic strategies to be instituted to prevent epithelial cell death\nand the consequent impairment of the secretory function.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Dr. Vincenzo Montinaro (Department of\nNephrology, University of Bari, Italy) for his expert technical\nassistance.

Since TNF-a is a\ntypical activator of NF-jB pathway, we studied the role of NF-jB activation in cell differentiation\nand death during the TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment. TNF-a induced rapid NF-jB activation in both\nHT-29 and FHC cell lines and this effect was differently modulated by NaBt in these two cell lines.\nIn HT-29 cells, NaBt potentiated NF-jB activity induced by TNF-a after 4 h treatment. However, this\ninitial potentiation of NF-jB activity was not observed in FHC cells. During additional time of TNF-a\nand NaBt co-treatment, NaBt decreased the TNF-a-mediated NF-jB activity in both cell types. We\nalso detected a different response of HT-29 and FHC cells after the pre-treatment with the NF-jB\ninhibitor parthenolide. Our results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis of\ncolon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we found significant differences in\nthe mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancer\norigin, suggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively involved in these processes in\ncancer cells.\n\n\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Above all, the quantity and ratio of lipids and fiber content\nin the diet are among the most important factors. Mutual interac-\ntion of endogenous and dietary substances may influence colorec-\ntal epithelium in various ways. They can encourage a rise of\ninfectious and inflammatory diseases or cancer of the intestine\nand, on the other hand, they may contribute to regeneration of in-\njured tissue or disease therapy [1,2].\n\nShort-chain fatty acid butyrate is formed in the gastrointestinal\ntract of mammals as a result of anaerobic bacterial fermentation of\ndietary fiber [3,4]. It modulates proliferation and induces differen-\ntiation and apoptosis of colon epithelial cells [5,3], both in vivo and\nin vitro, at concentrations of approximately 5 mM [6]. Butyrate can\nalso act as an energy source for the colonocytes. It has paradoxical\neffects on colonic epithelial proliferation\u2014stimulates proliferation\nof normal crypt cells and inhibits growth of colon cancer cells\n[7]. Thus, butyrate contributes significantly to the balance between\nthe cytokinetic processes of epithelial cells in the colon crypts.\nll rights reserved.\nTNF-a, an endogenously produced cytokine of the TNF family,\nbelongs to the intensively investigated biologically active sub-\nstances [8]. It plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory\nprocesses, endotoxic shock, and regulation of cell growth and\ndeath [9,10]. NNF-a is synthesized by macrophages and other\ncells in response to bacterial toxins, inflammatory products and\nother invasive stimuli. It has been suggested that a gut with ac-\ntive injury contains an increased number of NNF-a-secreting\ncells [11]. Endogenous TNF-a at levels higher than those in the\ncorresponding normal colorectal tissues have also been detected\nin extracts of colorectal tumor tissues resected from human pa-\ntients [12,13].\n\nThe proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, are typical\nactivators of the canonical NF-jB signaling cascade, which is acti-\nvated in response to injury, infection, inflammation and other\nstress conditions [14,15]. Butyrate has been shown to reduce\ninflammation in experimental colitis in rats [16], and to decrease\nproinflammatory cytokine expression in intestinal biopsies from\nCrohn\u2019s disease patients via NF-jB inactivation [17]. Therefore,\nit could be used during the therapy of colorectal chronic inflam-\nmations. On the other hand, it has been suggested that NF-jB\nactivation has anti-apoptotic effects in many cell lines [18]. In-\ncreased expression of IjB family proteins has also been found\nin differentiated parts of the colon crypts where the cells undergo\napoptosis [19].\n\nmailto:kozubik@ibp.cz\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n34 M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343\nTranscription factors of the NF-jB family, including RelA (p65),\nc-Rel, RelB, NFKB1 (p50/p105), and NFKB2 (p52/p100), regulate\nhundreds of genes in the context of multiple important physiolog-\nical and pathological processes [14,20]. In most cells, NF-jB is\npresent as a latent, inactive inhibitor of the jB (IjB)-bound com-\nplex in the cytoplasm. There are two main pathways leading to\nthe activation of NF-jB, namely the canonical and non-canonical\npathways or the classical and alternative pathways, respectively.\nIn both pathways, activation of an IjB kinase (IKK) complex is\nthe common upstream regulatory step. This results in phosphory-\nlation-induced degradation of the IjB, which enables the NF-jB di-\nmers to enter the nucleus and activate specific target gene\nexpression. During the canonical pathway, heterodimers of RelA\n(p65) with p50, p52, or p50 homodimers are liberated by degrada-\ntion of IjBs, particularly IjB-a, while p52/RelB heterodimers are\ntranslocated to the nucleus during the non-canonical pathway\n[21,15,22].\n\nComparing the effects of butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment be-\ntween cancer and non-cancer cells in vitro (using human colon\nadenocarcinoma HT-29 and fetal colon FHC cell lines) we demon-\nstrated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and apoptosis of colon\nepithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Furthermore, we inves-\ntigated involvement of the activation of NF-jB transcription factor\nin the mechanisms of the butyrate and TNF-a co-treatment effects.\nIt has been demonstrated previously that preincubation of cells\nwith butyrate, which induced differentiation, is able to inhibit\nTNF-a-activated NF-jB translocation in colon cancer cell lines\n(HT-29, CaCo-2, SW620) [23,24]. In the present study, we found\nsignificant differences in the mechanism of the NaBt and TNF-a\nco-treatment effects between cells of non-cancer and cancer origin,\nsuggesting that the NF-jB pathway may be more effectively in-\nvolved in these processes in cancer cells.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell cultures\n\nThe human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells and human fetal\ncolon FHC cells (both ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in\n25 mm2 flasks (TPP; Trasadigen, Switzerland) in McCoy\u2019s 5A med-\nium and in Dulbecco\u2018s modified Eagle medium (DMEM):F12 (1:1)\nmedium, respectively, supplemented with gentamicin (50 lg/ml;\nall Sigma\u2013Aldrich; Prague, Czech Republic) and 10% fetal bovine\nserum (PAN Biotech GmbH; Aidenbach, Germany). The cultures\nwere maintained at 37 \ufffdC in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The cells\nwere passaged twice a week after exposure to trypsin/EDTA\n(0.05/0.02%) with a plating density of 1:3. For the experiments,\ncells were seeded in 40 \ufffd 10 mm or 100 \ufffd 20 mm Petri dishes, or\nin 12- or 24-well plates (TPP) at a density of 5 \ufffd 104 cells/cm2.\nTwenty-four hours after seeding the cells were treated with NaBt\n(5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; both Sigma\u2013Aldrich), or both, as indi-\ncated in the respective experiments. For the inhibition of NF-jB\nactivation, the cells were pre-treated for 3 h with the inhibitor of\nIKK phosphorylation parthenolide (Biomol International, LP; PA,\nUSA) dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 (HT-29 cells) or\n20 (FHC cells) lM. The cells were harvested 4, 8, 24, 48, or 72 h\nafter the treatments. The culture medium was not replaced during\nthe experiments. Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 25 ng/ml; Invitro-\ngen Corporatiom; Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as a positive control\nfor MAPK pathway activation.\n\n2.2. Cell number counting\n\nCell growth was measured by counting the cells with a Coulter\nCounter (model ZM, Coulter Electronic, Luton, UK). Floating and\nadherent cells were counted separately, and the number of floating\ncells was expressed as a percentage of the whole cell number.\n\n2.3. Cell cycle distribution analysis\n\nThe cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in\nphosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol.\nDNA was stained (37 \ufffdC; 30 min) with Vindelov\u2019s solution (10 mM\nTris buffer, pH 8; 0.7 mg/ml RNAse; 50 lg/ml propidium iodide;\n0.1% Triton X-100). The DNA content was analyzed using flow\ncytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA; argon\nion laser, 488 nm for excitation). Cells (15 \ufffd 103) were acquired\nfor each sample and the percentage of cells in the individual cell\ncycle phases was analyzed using ModFit 3.0 software (Verity Soft-\nware House, Topsham, CA). Single cells were identified and gated\nby pulse-code processing of the area and the width of the signal.\nCell debris was excluded by appropriate rising of the forward scat-\nter threshold.\n\n2.4. MTT assay\n\nThe cells were growing on 96-well plates. Ten microliters of the\n2.5 mg/ml stock solution of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiasol-2yl]-2,5-diphe-\nnyl-tetrasolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) was added to each well.\nAfter 4 h of incubation at 37 \ufffdC in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, the\nmedium was removed, 50 ll of the extraction buffer (10% Triton\nX-100; 0.1 M HCl) was added and plates were gently shaken for\n2 h at room temperature [17]. The optical densities were measured\nat 570 nm (DigiScan Reader).\n\n2.5. Fluorescence microscopy\n\nThe cells were trypsinized and 0.5\u20132 \ufffd 106 cells (including\nfloating cell population) were incubated with 40 ll of 4,6-\ndiamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) staining solution (3 lg DAPI/\nml of methanol) in room temperature, in the dark for 30 min,\nand mounted to Mowiol. Apoptotic cells were counted using a\nfluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX70; Olympus; Prague,\nCzech Republic). The percentage of cells with the characteristic\napoptotic nuclear morphology (chromatin condensation and\nfragmentation) was determined from a total number of 200\ncells.\n\n2.6. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity determination\n\nThe cells were trypsinized, 5 \ufffd 105 cells were resuspended in\n500 ll of substrate buffer (10% diethanolamine; 5 mM MgCl2; pH\n9.7), and lysed by sonication for 5 \ufffd 10 s using a Branson Sonifier\nB-12 (Branson Ultrasonics Corp.; Danbury, CT) at a power of 30\nwatts. The cell lysates or alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Sigma\u2013Al-\ndrich) in several concentrations (15.6\u20131000 \ufffd 10\ufffd6 U/well) for a\ncalibration curve were incubated with ALP substrate (4-p-nitro-\nphenylphosphate; Fluka) in a 96-well plate (4 parallel wells in each\ngroup) at 37 \ufffdC for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 M\nNaOH (50 ll/well) and the optical densities were measured at\n405 nm by FluostarGalaxy (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offen-\nburg, Germany). The reading values (Units \ufffd 10\ufffd6/5 \ufffd 104 cells)\nwere converted to the percentage of control.\n\n2.7. Nuclear extracts preparation\n\nCells grown on 100 \ufffd 20 mm Petri dishes were washed with\nice-cold PBS, scraped into tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at\n0 \ufffdC (1000g). The pellets were then incubated in a lysis buffer\n(10 mM Tris base, pH 8.0, 60 mM KCl, 1.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,\n0.1 mM PMSF, 0.05% NP-40) for 10 min on ice and centrifuged for\n\n\n\nM. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343 35\n4 min at 0 \ufffdC (750g). The resulting \u2018\u2018nuclear pellets\u201d were rinsed\nwith the above lysis buffer without PMSF and NP-40. Nuclear ex-\ntracts were prepared by resuspending nuclear pellets in nuclear\nextraction buffer (20 mM Tris base, 420 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM MgCl2,\n0.25 mM EDTA (chelate II), 25% glycerol), incubating 30 min at\n4 \ufffdC, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 \ufffdC (13,000g). Protein con-\ncentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford\nassay, and stored at \ufffd80 \ufffdC until used.\n\n2.8. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)\n\nDouble stranded NF-jB oligonucleotide (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTC\nCCAGGC; VBC-Genomics GmbH; Vienna, Austria) was end-labeled\nwith biotin using the Biotin end-labeling kit (Pierce; Rockford, IL).\nThe binding reactions were performed by mixing 8 lg of the nucle-\nar extract (prepared as described above) with 0.3 lg poly-dIdC and\n3 ll of the binding buffer 5\ufffd (50 mM Tris base, 6 mM EDTA (che-\nlate II), 0.5 mM DTT, 50% (v/v) glycerol) to give a final volume of\n17 ll. After 10 min incubation in room temperature, 3 ll of\n10 lM oligonucleotide was added to each reaction and the reac-\ntions were incubated for an additional 30 min in room tempera-\nture. For the supershift, 1 ll of mouse anti-NF-kB p65 antibody\n(#sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA) was\nthen added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for\n1 h in 4 \ufffdC. To control specificity of the shifts, we also used specific\ncompetition (addition of the excess of unlabeled NF-jB oligonu-\ncleotide), non-specific competition (addition of the excess of unla-\nbeled EBNA DNA), free probe, and the reaction mixture without the\nnuclear extract. The reaction mixtures were separated in a 6.5%\npolyacrylamide/TBE gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane\n(Intergen; Purchase, NY). The visualization by streptavidin\u2013horse-\nradish peroxidase conjugate was performed using the LightShiftTM\n\nChemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce).\n\n2.9. Western blot analysis\n\nThe cells were scraped and lysed in an SDS lysis buffer (100 mM\nTris, pH 6.8; 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); 10% glycerol). The\nextracts of the total proteins were assayed with a DC protein assay\nkit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Equal amounts\n(20 lg) of whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts with 0.01% brom-\nphenol blue and 1% mercaptoethanol were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE\nusing 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred to poly-\nvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.; Bedford, MA)\nelectrophoretically in a buffer containing 192 mM glycine, 25 mM\nTris, and 10% methanol. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in\n5% powdered non-fat milk in wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in\n20 mM Tris; pH 7.6; 140 mM NaCl). Primary antibodies (rabbit\nanti-NF-jB p65, 1:500, #3034; rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2,\n1:2000, #9101; rabbit anti-ERK1/2, 1:1000, #9102; rabbit anti-\nphospho-p38, 1:2000, #9211; rabbit anti-p38, 1:1000, #9212; all\nCell Signaling Technology, Inc.; Beverly, MA; rabbit anti-I-jBa,\n1:500, #sc-203, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with\nthe blots for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the mem-\nbranes in a wash buffer, secondary antibodies coupled to horserad-\nish peroxidase (anti-mouse IgG, 1:3000; #NA931 and anti-rabbit\nIgG, 1:5000, #NA934, both Amersham Biosciences; Buckingham-\nshire, UK) were added for 1 h. The membranes were washed and\nantibody reactivity was visualized with the enhanced chemilumi-\nnescence (ECL+) reagent (Amersham Biosciences) against X-ray\nfilm-CP (Agfa-Gevaert Group; Mortsel, Belgium). The equal loading\nwas verified by b-actin or a-tubulin expression (mouse anti-b-ac-\ntin, 1:6000, #A5441; mouse anti-a-tubulin, 1:4000, #T6074; both\nSigma) and non-specific amidoblack staining of proteins on the\nmembrane after immunoblotting.\n2.10. Luciferase reporter construct and stable cell transfection\n\nThe reporter construct pBIIX-LUC was kindly donated by Dr. Kalle\nSaksela (Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Tampere, Fin-\nland). The NF-jB-driven plasmid pBIIX-LUC was constructed by\ninserting a synthetic fragment with two copies of the sequence\nACA GAG GGG ACT TTC CGA GAG separated by four nucleotides\n(ATCT) in front of the mouse fos promoter in plasmid pfLUC [25].\n\nThe reporter plasmid was cotransfected with pSV2neo neomycin-\nresistance plasmid into HT-29 cells using electroporation (Bio-Rad\nLaboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA). Briefly, approximately 1\ufffd 107 cells\nwas mixed with 20 lg of reporter plasmid and 2 lg of pSV2neo plas-\nmid, and electroporated (275 V, 950 lF, 2\ufffd pulse). Subsequently, the\ncells were seeded on a 100\ufffd 20 mm dish (TPP) with a feeder of HT-29\ncells treated with mitomycin-C (5 lg/ml; Sigma\u2013Aldrich). Neomycin\nresistant clones were selected in 300 lg/ml of geneticin (G418 sulfate;\nAlexis; San Diego, CA). The clones containing the reporter plasmid\nwere confirmed by luciferase activity assay.\n\n2.11. Luciferase activity assay\n\nStably transfected cells were seeded in 12-well plates and trea-\nted 24 h later.

Growth, death, and differentiation of colon epithelial cells during\nTNF-a and NaBt co-treatment\n\n3.1.1. Cell growth\nCompared to control, TNF-a in a concentration of 15 ng/ml did\n\nnot significantly affect cell proliferation of both cell lines used at\nany time of treatment. On the other hand, NaBt (5 mM) inhibited\ncell growth in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines (Fig. 1A), but with dif-\nferent dynamics. The NaBt effect was already apparent after 24 h,\nbeing most significant in FHC cells after 72 h (approximately 70%\ndecrease of cell number versus control). In HT-29 cells, NaBt inhib-\nited cell growth the most significantly after 24 and 48 h of the\ntreatment (approximately 40% decrease of cell number versus con-\ntrol), and the effect diminished after 72 h (only 20% decrease). No\nadditional changes of cell growth were detected after NaBt and\nTNF-a co-treatment in both cell lines.\n\n3.1.2. Cell cycle\nNaBt arrested the cells in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle and\n\nsimultaneously decreased the proportion of cells in the S-phase\n(Fig. 1B). This effect corresponded with cell growth inhibition\nshown in Fig. 1A in both HT-29 and FHC cells, and was not signif-\nicantly affected during co-treatment of NaBt with TNF-a. More-\nover, TNF-a alone had no effect on cell cycle distribution.\n\n3.1.3.

While TNF-a\nalone had no effect, it significantly suppressed the NaBt-in-\nduced ALP activity (approximately 3.2-fold in HT-29 cells\nand 5.5-fold in FHC cells after 48 h of TNF-a and NaBt co-\ntreatment).\n\n\n\nM.

Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343\n3.2. NF-jB activation in HT-29 and FHC cells during TNF-a and NaBt\nco-treatment\n\nWe investigated the role of NF-jB in the above-described ef-\nfects comparing fetal FHC and cancer HT-29 cells. To study NF-\njB activation, four different approaches were used. Firstly, we\nestablished HT-29 cell clones with a pBIIX-LUC reporter construct\nfor NF-jB activity detection. TNF-a induced an increase in NF-jB\nactivity in HT-29 cells compared with the untreated control, and\nthis effect was time-dependent (approximately 41- or 27-fold in-\ncrease after 4 h, 47- or 36-fold increase after 8 h, and 75- or 48-fold\nincrease after 24 h treatment in clone 3 or clone 93, respectively;\nFig. 3). Secondly, the time-dependent increase of TNF-a-induced\nNF-jB binding activity in HT-29 and FHC cells was also observed\nby electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Fig. 4). Thirdly,\ntranslocation of p65 protein into the nucleus was confirmed in nu-\nclear extracts of HT-29 and FHC cells using Western blotting\n(Fig. 5). Finally, expression of NF-jB inhibitory IjB-a protein was\ndetected in whole HT-29 and FHC cell extracts using Western blot-\nting. TNF-a induced a decrease of IjB-a expression after 4, 8, and\n24 h in both cell lines (Fig. 6).\n\nNaBt alone had no effect on NF-jB activity during a short-time\ninterval, but after 24 h the elevation of the activity compared to\ncontrol was apparent in both HT-29 and FHC cell lines. In HT-29\ncells, this increased activity was detected by clones with the repor-\nter construct (Fig. 3), p65 protein expression in nuclear extracts\n(Fig. 5), and by a decrease of IjB expression (Fig. 6). However, it\ndid not appear in EMSA analysis (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in\nFig. 3. NF-jB binding activity (expressed as relative luciferase activity) of two HT-29 clo\nNaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination. Data are presented as mean\ncontrols considered as 100%; \u00a7P < 0.05 (\u2013P < 0.01) versus NaBt alone; \ufffdP < 0.05 versus TN\nFHC cells the elevation of NF-jB activity mediated by NaBt 24 h\ntreatment was observed by all methods used except for Western\nblot of p65 in nuclear extracts (Fig. 5).\n\nAfter co-treatment with TNF-a and NaBt, NF-jB activity was\ndifferently modulated in cancer and fetal cells compared to the ef-\nfect of TNF-a alone. While the NF-jB binding activity (Figs. 3 and\n4), its nuclear translocation (Fig. 5), and IjB degradation (Fig. 6)\nwere initially increased after 4 h of the TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-\nment in comparison with TNF-a alone in HT-29 cells, these effects\ndid not appear in FHC cells (Figs. 4\u20136). After 8 h of TNF-a and NaBt\nco-treatment, the activity (Figs. 3 and 4) and nuclear translocation\n(Fig. 5) of NF-jB and IjB degradation (Fig. 6) were similar with\nthat of TNF-a alone treatment in both cell lines. Finally, these\nparameters were decreased after 24 h (TNF-a and NaBt co-treat-\nment compared to treatment with TNF-a alone; Figs. 3\u20136).\n\n3.3. Effects of NF-jB inhibition on HT-29 and FHC cell differentiation\nand apoptosis during TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment\n\nIn order to inhibit NF-jB binding activity, we searched for opti-\nmal dose and time of parthenolide pre-treatment of HT-29 and FHC\ncells. As indicated in Fig. 7, we used both EMSA (Fig. 7A and C) and\nWestern blot of nuclear extracts for p65 expression (Fig. 7B and D)\nto test the effects of 1 or 3 h pre-treatment with parthenolide (20\nor 10 lM) on inhibition of TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation. A sig-\nnificant decrease of NF-jB translocation to the nucleus was de-\ntected after 3 h of parthenolide pre-treatment in both cell lines\nused, but in FHC cells, the decrease was apparent only after higher\nnes (#3 and #93) with pBIIX-LUC construct after 4, 8, or 24 h treatment with either\ns \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 (**P < 0.01) versus untreated\n\nF-a alone.\n\n\n\nFig. 4. NF-jB binding activity (using EMSA) of HT-29 and FHC cells after 4, 8, or 24 h of treatment with either NaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination;\ncontrols of shift specificity (free NF-jB probe labeled with biotin (lane 1), reaction mixture without nuclear extract (lane 2), specific competition with 100-molar excess of\nunlabeled NF-jB probe (lane 3), TNF-a (15 ng/ml) for 4 h (lane 4), TNF-a (15 ng/ml) for 4 h with anti-p65 antibody added to the reaction mixture (lane 5), and competition\nwith 100-molar excess of unlabeled NF-jB non-specific oligonucleotides). Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.\n\nM. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343 39\nconcentration of parthenolide. Thus, we used a 3 h pre-treatment\nwith 10 lM of parthenolide for HT-29 cells and 20 lM for FHC cells\nfor further experiments. To exclude the effects of this NF-jB inhib-\nitor on MAPK pathways, Western blot analysis for phosphorylated\nand total protein expression of ERK1/2 and p38 after 3 h of parthe-\nnolide pre-treatment (10 lM for HT-29 and 20 lM for FHC cells)\nand/or 10 min treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml), which was used as\na positive control for MAPK pathway activation, was performed\n(Fig. 7E). No changes in ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and no\ninhibition of EGF-mediated MAPK activation was detected after\nparthenolide pre-treatment.\n\nBoth HT-29 and FHC cells presented decreased sensitivity to\nNaBt-mediated inhibition of cell growth after parthenolide pre-\ntreatment (Fig. 8A). However, cell growth was not significantly af-\nfected by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatments in both parthenolide pre-\ntreated and non-pre-treated cells compared to NaBt alone.\n\nParthenolide increased apoptosis induced by NaBt (DAPI stain-\ning) in both HT-29 and FHC cells (Fig. 8B). However, apoptosis in-\nduced by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was modulated by\nparthenolide differently in HT-29 and FHC cells. While in HT-29\ncells, parthenolide significantly potentiated apoptosis induced by\nthis type of treatment (3.6-fold increase versus NaBt alone), no sig-\nnificant effect of was apparent in FHC cells (1.6-fold increase ver-\nsus NaBt alone).\n\nUnlike FHC cells, the differentiation ability of HT-29 cells in-\nduced by NaBt was strongly decreased after parthenolide pre-\ntreatment (Fig. 8C). In FHC cells, the suppressive effect of TNF-a\non NaBt-mediated cell differentiation (5.8-fold decrease of ALP\nactivity versus NaBt alone) was attenuated after parthenolide\npre-treatment (2.7-fold decrease of ALP activity versus NaBt\nalone).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nColon epithelial cell kinetics may be affected by endogenous\ngrowth regulators or by dietary factors like TNF-a and butyrate,\nrespectively. We demonstrated that TNF-a markedly reduced\nNaBt-induced differentiation in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells\ncontrary to its potentiation of apoptosis [26]. The ability of TNF-a\nto synergize with NaBt in promoting apoptosis in colon cancer cells\n\n\n\nFig. 5. NF-jB p65 protein expression in whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts of HT-\n29 and FHC cells treated for 4, 8, or 24 h with NaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF),\nor their combination. Expression of b-actin or PCNA was used as equal loading\ncontrol. Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.\n\nFig. 6. IjB-a protein expression of HT-29 and FHC cells treated for 4, 8, or 24 h with\nNaBt (5 mM), TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or their combination. b-Actin expression was\nused as equal loading control. Similar results were obtained in two other\nindependent experiments.\n\n40 M. Hy\u0301z\u030cd\u2019alov\u00e1 et al. / Cytokine 44 (2008) 33\u201343\nwas shown also by other authors [27\u201329]. However, we newly\ndemonstrate a TNF-a-mediated increase of apoptosis induced by\nNaBt in non-cancer cell line (FHC) derived from normal human fe-\ntal colon. We found a much more dramatic increase of NaBt-in-\nduced differentiation in cancer HT-29 than in fetal FHC cells. This\ndifferent dynamic was already demonstrated by Fajkus et al. [30].\nInterestingly, NaBt-mediated differentiation was significantly sup-\npressed by TNF-a in both cell lines, with the higher effectiveness in\nFHC cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that induction of the\napoptotic process by NaBt is reduced or delayed in fetal cells com-\npared to cancer cells. On the other hand, the potentiation of apop-\ntosis by TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment was observed in both cancer\nand fetal cells.\n\nWe suggested NF-jB to be involved in the mechanism of TNF-a-\ninduced modulation of cell differentiation and apoptosis mediated\nby NaBt. The transcription factor NF-jB can play a pivotal role in\nregulating programmed cell death and can possess the ability to\nactivate both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes [31]. TNF-a\nbelongs to the typical activators of the canonical pathway of NF-\njB activation, which is completed by p50/p65 heterodimer binding\nto DNA. To elucidate the role of NF-jB activation during the inves-\ntigated TNF-a and NaBt co-treatment, were compared cancer HT-\n29 and fetal FHC colon cell lines with regard to this parameter.\nWe detected time-dependent TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation in\nHT-29 cells using a reporter constructs sensitive to NF-jB activity\n(pBIIX-LUC). Moreover, we indicated a strong activation of NF-jB\nby TNF-a not only in HT-29, but also in normal FHC cells (results\nof EMSA, p65 expression in nuclear extracts, and decreased level\nof IjB in whole cell extracts). From the report of Zwacka et al. it\ncould be supposed that TNF-a-induced prolonged NF-jB activation\nis associated with TNF-a resistance [32]. Considering that both HT-\n29 and FHC cells are relatively resistant to TNF-a cytotoxicity this\nobservation is in agreement with our results.\n\nIn accord with the results of Rouet-Benzineb et al. we demon-\nstrated no changes in NF-jB binding activity after short-time treat-\nment with NaBt (4 or 8 h) in both cell lines [33]. However, after\n24 h of NaBt treatment, the NF-jB activity was enhanced in both\ncells of adenocarcinoma and fetal origin despite the previously\npublished results that butyrate decreased the activity of this tran-\nscription factor [34]. It has been previously found that butyrate\ncould alter NF-jB subunit composition induced by proinflamma-\ntory cytokines. Inan et al. demonstrated that NaBt pre-treatment\nof HT-29 cells inhibits the TNF-a-mediated p65 and p50 transloca-\ntion to the nucleus [35]. These authors also suggested that NaBt\nprevented the NF-jB subunit translocation by suppressing cellular\nproteasome activity (and subsequently IjB degradation) through\nNaBt ability to inhibit histone deacetylases [24,36]. However, our\nresults showed that NaBt increased TNF-a-mediated NF-jB bind-\ning activity, p65 nuclear translocation and IjB-a degradation in\ncancer HT-29 cells, but not in fetal FHC cells, after 4 h of NaBt\nand TNF-a co-treatment. The difference in NaBt ability to modulate\nTNF-a-mediated NF-jB activation between cancer and fetal colon\nepithelial cells represents the most important finding of the pres-\nent study. The NaBt-mediated increase of TNF-a-induced NF-jB\nactivity in HT-29 cells disappeared during the subsequent 4 h of\ntreatment, and after 24 h NaBt significantly inhibited the TNF-a-\ninduced NF-jB binding activity in both cell lines. The inhibition\nof TNF-a-induced p65 nuclear translocation by NaBt pre-treatment\nwas also indicated in SW480 and SW620 human colon carcinoma\ncells [37,29]. While the NaBt concentration around 5 mM, which\ncorresponds to the physiological concentration in the colon, was\nthe same in the above-mentioned and our experiments, based on\nour previous works [38,39], we used significantly lower doses of\n\n\n\nFig. 7. NF-jB binding activity (using EMSA) (A and C) and NF-jB p65 protein expression in nuclear extracts (B and D) of HT-29 (A and B) and FHC (C and D) cells after 1 or 3 h\npre-treatment with parthenolide (10 or 20 lM; PAR), 4 h treatment with TNF-a (15 ng/ml; TNF), or both (TNF + PAR). Phospho and total ERK1/2 and p38 protein expression\n(E) in whole cell extracts of HT-29 and FHC cells after 3 h pre-treatment with parthenolide (10 or 20 lM; PAR), 10 min treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml) or both (PAR + EGF).\nPCNA and a-tubulin expressions were used as equal loading control. Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment.\n\nM.

The difference in the concentrations\nof TNF-a used and also application of this cytokine simultaneously\nwith NaBt (in contrast to NaBt pre-treatment used by the above-\nmentioned authors) may play a role in the dissimilarity of our\nresults.\n\nTo study the involvement of NF-jB in the modulation of NaBt\neffects by TNF-a, we used an NF-jB inhibitor, sesquiterpene lac-\ntone parthenolide. It prevents the NIK- and MEKK1-induced activa-\ntion of IKKs, but does not interfere with the induced activation of\nMAPKs [40]. We found a significant difference in parthenolide sen-\nsitivity between fetal and cancer cells, which may be corresponded\nto the distinct way of NF-jB activation in these two cell lines.\nMoreover, in cancer cell line, pre-treatment with parthenolide\ncaused a significant increase of apoptosis induction by NaBt and\nTNF-a co-treatment, while, in fetal cells, it inhibited apoptosis in-\nduced by this type of treatment. This distinct response could be\nassociated with lower differentiation status in NaBt- or both NaBt\nand TNF-a-treated HT-29 cells after parthenolide pre-treatment\ncompared with FHC cells.\n\nOur results indicated that NaBt-mediated differentiation and\napoptosis of colon epithelial cells can be modulated by TNF-a. Fur-\nthermore, we found significant differences in the mechanism of the\nresponse to NaBt and TNF-a co-treatment between cells of non-\ncancer and adenocarcinoma origin, suggesting that the NF-jB\npathway is more effectively involved in these processes in cancer\ncells. Our findings imply the possible role of TNF-a in the develop-\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

The\nGoIL-2 shows, respectively, 79%, 82e85%, and 91e92% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in cDNA, and also\nshows, respectively, 63%, 63e64%, and 82e85% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in amino acid sequence. Recombinant\nGoIL-2 (rGoIL-2) protein expressed in Escherichia coli has an approximate molecular weight of 18 kDa. The rGoIL-2 has biological\neffect on goose and duck as well as chicken lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, though the effect on duck and chicken\nlymphocytes has been found to be relatively weak. In addition, rGoIL-2 also strengthens goose immune responses induced by\n\nvaccinating the inactivated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus. The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rGoIL-2\nrecognized the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2 protein expressed in vero cells. Antiserum and mAb 5B10 to rGoIL-2 can inhibit\nthe biological activity of rGoIL-2 and endogenous GoIL-2. The results, at the first time, indicated that goose IL-2 reserves species-\nspecialties in the biological functions and can be used as a potential immunoadjuvant for goose vaccination and immunotherapeutic\n\npurposes. Finally, the mAbs to rGoIL-2 also provide a useful tool for further immunobiological studies of IL-2 in avian immune\nsystems.\n\ufffd 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nIL-2 is a glycoprotein produced principally by\nactivated T cells and some B cells and a cytokine that\nregulates lymphocyte function. IL-2 controls the ampli-\nfication of native T cells by initially stimulating growth\nfollowing antigen activation, and also has effects on NK\ncells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [1e4].\nIL-2 has been developed as an immunotherapeutic agent\nin chronic microbial infection and cancer, and as an\nenhancing agent in vaccine [5e7].

IL-2R is composed of three distinct subunits:\nIL-2Ra, IL-2Rb and IL-2Rg which are encoded, re-\nspectively, by distinct and structurally unrelated genes\n[9]. Resting T cells express low levels of IL-2Ra-subunit\n(Tac antigen) that binds to IL-2 with a low affinity.\nIL-2Rb-subunit alone or in combination with a or g\nproduce a receptor with intermediate affinity, and the\ng-subunit alone does not bind IL-2, while a receptor\ncomprised of three subunits offers the highest affinity for\nIL-2 [8].\n\nUp to now, in addition to human IL-2, IL-2 genes for\nmore than 30 animal species also have been cloned and\nidentified [10]. Recently, IL-2 gene for chicken (ChIL-2)\nand turkey (TuIL-2) have been cloned and sequenced\n\nmailto:jyzhou@zju.edu.cn\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n329J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\nsuccessfully [11e13]. The ChIL-2 gene is mapped to\nchromosome 4, linked to annexin V with synteny with\nmouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 4 [12].\nOur previous study revealed that some variations exist in\nthe open reading frame (ORF) of ChIL-2 from different\nchicken breeds [14]. The cDNAcoding forChIL-2 protein\nwas introduced into several prokaryotic and eukaryotic\nexpression systems to produce biologically active re-\ncombinant cytokines [13,15,16]. ChIL-2 plays an impor-\ntant role as an immunoregulatory molecule identical to\nmammalian IL-2 and has been shown to stimulate T\nlymphoblast cells, increase the proportion of both CD4C\n\nandCD8C peripheral bloodT cells [17], enhanceNK cells\nactivity and vaccine response to Eimeria parasites [18],\nand strengthen the protective immunity against infectious\nbursal disease virus [19], indicating that ChIL-2 has\npractical importance in potentially enhancing immune\nresponses to vaccines and infectious agents in poultry.\nFurthermore, mAbs to ChIL-2 have also been produced,\nand used to study the biological activities of ChIL-2\n[20,21]. Comparatively, little work has been performed on\navian IL-2s and their receptors. Only a mAb designated\nINN-CH-16 can react with a 48e50 kDa antigen ex-\npressed on activated chicken T lymphocytes and inhibited\nthe proliferation of Con A-stimulated blasts in response\nto supernatants of stimulated chicken T cells. These\nfeatures led to the hypothesis that INN-CH-16 may\nrecognize the ChIL-2R [22,23].\n\nAs for waterfowl cytokines in 1997, Bertram et al.\n[24] found lymphokines released by duck peripheral\nblood lymphocytes and splenocytes stimulated with\nPHA, which was of similar functional homology to\nChIL-2 in maintaining the lymphocyte proliferation.\nRecently, the cloning and functional characterization of\nduck IL-2 have been reported [25e27]. However, no\ninformation was available on the goose cytokines.\nHereby, the goal of the present study was to molecularly\nclone the cDNA fragment of goose IL-2 (GoIL-2), to\nexpress the GoIL-2 open reading frame in vitro\nexpression system, to prepare mAbs to GoIL-2, and to\ndetect the bioactivity of the recombinant GoIL-2\n(rGoIL-2) protein in vitro and in vivo.\n\n2. Results\n\n2.1. Molecular cloning and analysis of goose\nIL-2 cDNA\n\nThe mRNA was isolated from goose SMC stimulated\nwith 10 mg/ml Con A at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 48\nand 72 h. GoIL-2 cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-\nPCR using these mRNAs as templates. An approxi-\nmately 0.8 kb DNA fragment, in size, was amplified\nfrom nine of the 12 mRNAs (Fig. 1). The sequencing\nresults revealed that cDNA fragment of GoIL-2 was\n718 nt in length (GenBank accession no. AY392557).\nGoIL-2 cDNA fragment encodes a polypeptide of 141\namino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of\n16.29 kDa. Analysis of the signal peptide revealed that\nthere was a potential cleavage site between amino acid\nresidues 21 and 22 (arrow in Fig. 2). The predicted signal\npeptide of GoIL-2 was similar in size to that of\nmammalian animals (20 aa) and other birds (22 aa).\n\nThe deduced amino acid sequence of GoIL-2 was\ncompared with those of the several avian andmammalian\nspecies. The alignment analysis showed that GoIL-2\nshared 85% identity to DuIL-2 (GenBank accession\nno. AY193713), 63% to ChIL-2 (GenBank accession no.\nAF294321), 64% to TuIL-2 (GenBank accession\nno. AJ007463), 9% to human IL-2 (GenBank accession\nno. U25676), and 7e20% to other mammalian IL-2s. As\nshown in Fig. 2, in IL-2 sequences of the compared avian\nspecies, there are 78 conserved amino acid residues\nincluding three cysteine residues (position 63, 70 and\n119), indicating that there is at least one di-sulfate bond in\nthe molecules. However, Lys48 andAsn80 are present only\nin GoIL-2 amino acid sequence. Thr34,45,114, Lys73,105,\nIle75,110, Asp86,90, Glu104 and Arg132 are the conserved\namino acid residues in goose and duck IL-2s, but are\nvariable in chicken and turkey IL-2s. On the contrary,\nfour amino acid residues (Ala14, Ile42, His51 and Leu131)\nwere conserved in chicken and turkey IL-2s, but were\nvariable in goose and duck IL-2s. Phylogenetic analysis\n(Fig. 3) shows further that the avian IL-2s were\nsubdivided into two monophyletic lineages. The goose\nand duck IL-2s formed a monophyletic group distinct\nfrom ChIL-2 and TuIL-2, confirming the similarity\nbetween duck and goose IL-2s.\n\n2.2. Expression and purification of the\nHis-GoIL-2 fusion protein\n\nThe gene fragment encoding GoIL-2 protein (without\nsignal peptide) was cloned into the pBAD/His B\nexpression vector, where the araB promoter is controlled\nby arabinose.

In immunocytochemical staining, the\nacetone-fixed pEGFP-GoIL-2-transfected vero cells\nwere detected, respectively, by five mAbs to rGoIL-2\n(Fig. 5deh), while no signal was observed in vero cells\ntransfected with pEGFP-c2 vector (Fig. 5c), demon-\nstrating that these mAbs hold the epitopes of GoIL-2\nprotein expressed in vero cells.\n\n2.5. In vitro bioactivity of goose IL-2\n\nThe concentration of the E. coli-derived soluble\nrGoIL-2 in the protein preparation was 0.656 mg/ml.\nThe biological activity of E. coli-derived rGoIL-2 and\nendogenous GoIL-2 was tested by in vitro proliferation\nof goose, duck and chicken spleen cells. Goose\n(5! 106 cells/well), duck (5! 106 cells/well) and chicken\n(5! 106 cells/well) spleen cells were cultured in the\npresence of either rGoIL-2, irrelevant protein control,\nRPMI-1640eFCS or the supernatants from Con A-\nstimulated SMC in a series of 2-fold dilutions. Data in\nFig. 6A showed that 1.6 ng rGoIL-2/well can significantly\nstimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocytes,\nwhile rGoIL-2 was 6.3 ng/well for duck lymphocytes\nand 25 ng/well for chicken lymphocytes. These results\nindicated that the stimulation effect of rGoIL-2 on both\nchicken and duck lymphocytes was weak. On the other\nhand, 0.8 ng/well rChIL-2 was needed in the proliferation\nassay of chicken lymphocytes and 12.5 ng rChIL-2/well\nfor duck lymphocytes and 6.3 ng rChIL-2/well for goose\nlymphocytes (Fig. 6B). 6.3 ng/well rDuIL-2 induces\nsignificantly in vitro proliferation of duck lymphocytes\nFig. 5. GoIL-2 expressed in vero cells (!110). (a) (fluorescence) and (c) (immunocytochemical staining) are vero cells transfected with pEGFP-c2\n\nvector alone. (b) Indicates GFP-GoIL-2 expressed in vero cells 3 h after transfection (fluorescence).

Neither the protein control from E. coli\nLMG194 strain transfected with pBAD/His B vector\nalone, nor the RPMI-1640eFCS could stimulate the\nproliferation of activated goose, duck and chicken\nlymphocytes.\n\n2.6. Ability of mAbs to neutralize the biological\nactivity of recombinant and endogenous IL-2\n\nFive mAbs and one pAb to rGoIL-2 were tested for\ntheir ability to neutralize the biological function of the\nrecombinant and endogenous GoIL-2 as measured by\nthe inhibition of Con A-stimulated lymphocyte pro-\nliferation. Only mAb 5B10 and pAb exhibited neutral-\nizing activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). mAb\n5B10 neutralized 85% of the lymphocyte-stimulating\nactivity of rGoIL-2 and 80% for endogenous GoIL-2.\nThe inhibiting effect of pAb on the activity of rGoIL-2\nand endogenous GoIL-2 was found to be 100%.\n\n2.7. In vivo immune response to AIV vaccine induced\nby rGoIL-2\n\nFollowing the intramuscular inoculations with the\nrGoIL-2 and the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine,\nblood samples were collected at specified times and the\nserum HI antibody to AIV was measured. As shown in\nTable 2, in gooses injected intramuscularly with both\nrGoIL-2 protein (300 ng or 350 ng per goose, respec-\ntively) and AIV vaccine 2 weeks after immunization, the\naverage titers of HI antibodies to AIV reached 6.3e6.4\nlog 2, while the average titers of HI antibody to AIV\nwere 5.2e5.3 log 2 in gooses only vaccinated with AIV\nvaccine or with both 250 ng rGoIL-2 and AIV vaccine.\nThe results clearly showed that 300 ng rGoIL-2 per\ngoose strengthened in vivo immune responses induced\nby the inactivated oil emulsion AIV vaccine.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nUp to date, information about goose IL-2 has not\nbeen available. Recently, the cloning and functional\ncharacterization of chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s have\nbeen reported [11e15,17,25e27]. The amino acid identity\namongst these avian IL-2s was up to 58e73%. In this\nreport, the goose IL-2 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR\nusing primers based on the highly conserved regions\namong chicken, turkey and duck IL-2s. We found that\nGoIL-2mRNAwas undetectable usingRT-PCR in goose\nSMC 1 h and 72 h after Con A stimulation, but was\ndetected in all samples from 2 h to 48 h after stimulation,\nshowing that GoIL-2 expression began 1 h after stimula-\ntion and stopped 72 h after stimulation. Sundick et al. [11]\ndetected the ChIL-2 mRNA 5 h after stimulation with\nConA. Inmitogen-stimulatedmouse spleen cells, the IL-2\ngene is only transiently expressed with maximal mRNA\nsteady state levels between 6e14 h post-stimulation [28].\nIL-2 mRNA expression of northern elephant seal peaked\nin the first 8 h following Con A stimulation [29].\n\nWhether rGoIL-2 protein expressed in E. coli pos-\nsessed a biological function, we measured the bioactivity\nof GoIL-2 protein using in vitro lymphocyte proliferation\nand in vivo immune responses of AIV vaccine vaccina-\ntion. As little as 1.6 ng/well of rGoIL-2 could significantly\nstimulate in vitro proliferation of goose lymphocytes\nwhile 6.3 ng rGoIL-2/well was needed for duck lympho-\ncytes and 25 ng rGoIL-2/well for chicken lymphocytes\nwere need (Fig. 6A). In addition, after each goose was\nintramuscularly vaccinated with a dose of 300e350 ng\nrGoIL-2, the vaccinated gooses reveal strengthening\nimmune responses to AIV vaccine immunization. These\ndata suggested that rGoIL-2 had biological effects,\nthough the effect on duck and chicken lymphocytes was\nrelatively weak. These evidences mentioned above led\nto sufficient support that functional similarity existed\nbetween goose and duck as well as chicken IL-2\nmolecules. Furthermore, these results implied that the\nrGoIL-2 was an important immunoregulatory molecule\nwell-studied in chicken and mammalian counterparts\n[30e33]. Similarly, an in vitro proliferation of chicken,\nduck and goose lymphocytes induced byChIL-2 aswell as\nDuIL-2 was similar to that of GoIL-2 (Fig. 6B and C).\nThe result further demonstrated that the effect of\nrGoIL-2, rChIL-2 and rDuIL-2 was dose dependent\nand certain species-specialties existed. Previous reports\nshowed that there was certain species-characteristic\n\n\n\n333J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\n\n\n\n334 J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\nFig. 7. Neutralizing activity of anti-IL-2 Abs in goose IL-2 lymphocyte proliferation assay induced by rGoIL-2 and supernatant of 24 h Con A-\n\nstimulated goose SMC. Concentration of mAb 5B10 used was 30 ng/ml, and that of polyclonal antibody was 3 mg/ml. Non-immunized rabbit serum\n\nand mAb to spike protein of IBV [40] were used as negative controls. Cells without addition of any antibody were used as background control. Values\n\nare expressed as mean countsG standard error.\nbetween IL-2 from cells of various species [34e38]. The\nproliferative response of human lymphocytes to recombi-\nnant porcine IL-2 was only 50% of that seen with\nrecombinant HuIL-2 [38]. Recombinant ovine IL-2 was\nable to stimulate the proliferation of bovine lymphocytes\nbut not porcine lymphocytes. It was not surprising that\nthere was 97% amino acid identity between the ovine and\nbovine proteins while the amino acid identity between\novine and porcine IL-2 was 73%. Both ovine and bovine\nIL-2 amino acid residues involved in the binding to the\nhuman equivalents of the IL-2Ra (p55) and IL-2Rb (p75)\nsubunits showed further that both these two domains of\nthe ligand were entirely conserved [34,38]. Comparison of\nthe ovine and porcine IL-2 amino acid sequences revealed\nthat six of the 25 residues involved in binding to the IL-\n2Ra (p55) were different. As for the IL-2Rb (p75) binding\ndomain, five of the 10 amino acid residues were different.\nHence, the amino acid residues in the two receptor\nbinding domains were less conserved between ovine and\nporcine IL-2 compared with the ovine and bovine IL-2\n[39].\n\nIn our study, five mAbs specific for rGoIL-2\nwere produced. Anti-GoIL-2 mAbs do not recognize\nrDuIL-2 and rChIL-2 proteins. While the E. coli-derived\nrGoIL-2 could be recognized by mAbs 5H6 and 5F6\nto rDuIL-2, indicating that five anti-GoIL-2 mAbs\nrecognized a conserved epitope in the duck and chicken\nmolecules. And mAbs 5H6 and 5F6 to rDuIL-2\nrecognized conserved epitopes in duck and goose\nmolecules. Furthermore, all mAb to E. coli-derived\nGoIL-2 reacted specifically with EGFP-GoIL-2 protein\nexpressed in vero cells, evincing that the five mAbs\nremained the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2.\nHowever, in neutralizing assay, only one of the five mAbs\n(mAb 5B10) was able to neutralize the activity of rGoIL-2\nand endogenous GoIL-2 in Con A-induced lymphocyte\nproliferation assay, indicating that only mAb 5B10 reacts\nwith the functional domain of GoIL-2 protein.\n\n4. Materials and methods\n\n4.1. Animals\n\nThe embryonated eggs of Eastern Zhejiang White\ngoose (Xiangshan institute of Eastern Zhejiang White\ngoose, China) and Muscovy duck (Yuyao Shennong\npoultry Co. Ltd., Zhejiang, China) were hatched at our\nlaboratory, and reared in a special room with unlimited\naccess to feed and water and used at 30 days. Thirty day-\nold specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Leghorn chickens were\nobtained from Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal\nTechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China. Four week-old\nBALB/c mice were purchased from Shanghai Labora-\ntory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences,\nShanghai, China. New Zealand white rabbits (NZW\nFig. 6.

All\nlaboratory animals and animal subjects used in this\nstudy have been approved by the scientific ethical\ncommittee of the Zhejiang University.\n\n4.2. RNA isolation, RT-PCR and sequencing\n\nGoose splenicmononuclear cells (SMC)were prepared\nas previously described by Zhou et al. [14]. SMC\nstimulated with Con A for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24,\n48 and 72 h were harvested, respectively. Total cellular\nmRNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL,\nGaithersburg, MD). Primers were designed according to\nthe conserved cDNA sequence for DuIL-2, ChIL-2 and\nTuIL-2 (GenBank accession no. AF294323, AF017645\nand AJ007463, respectively). Sense primer (5#-AATAC-\nTAGCACAGACAACCAG-3#) corresponded nt posi-\ntions 59e81. Antisense primer (5#-TTACTGAAAGAT-\nTTATTAAATATCATCTA-3#) was complementary to\nnt positions 798e824. The cDNAs were synthesized from\ntotal cellular RNA using the antisense primer. PCR was\nconducted with sense and antisense primers under the\nconditions consisting of 30 cycles of denaturation at\n95 \ufffdC for 1 min, primer annealing at 45 \ufffdC for 45 s and\nDNA extension at 72 \ufffdC for 2 min. The final DNA\nextension was carried out at 72 \ufffdC for 10 min. RT-PCR\nproducts were detected in 1% agarose gel. RT-PCR\nproduct was sequenced. The predicted amino acid\nsequence of GoIL-2 protein was compared with that of\navian and mammalian IL-2s from GenBank using\nDNASTAR 5.0 software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,\nWI, USA). Putative Signal peptide of GoIL-2 protein\nwas determined using prediction servers at http://\nwww.cbs.dtu.dk./services/.\n\n4.3. Expression and purification of recombinant\nGoIL-2\n\nBased on the cDNA sequence of the above-men-\ntioned GoIL-2, the GoIL-2 ORF without the putative\nsignal peptide sequence was obtained by PCR using the\nupstream primer 5#-GCGAATTCGCACCTCTATCA-\n\nTable 2\n\nGoose anti-AIV (H9N2) HI antibody response induced by rGoIL-2\n\nGroup Animal\n\nNo.\n\nrGoIL-2 dose\n\n(ng/goose)\n\nSerum HI titer\n\n(log 2)a\n\n1st\n\nweek\n\n2nd\n\nweek\n\n3rd\n\nweek\n\n4th\n\nweek\n\nVaccine 10 250 0 5.2 5.6 6.6\n\n10 300 0 6.3 6.7 7.7\n\n10 350 0 6.4 6.9 8.2\n\n10 ! 0 5.3 5.8 6.5\n\nControl 10 ! 0 0 0 0\n\na HI titer was geometry mean titer.\nGAGAA-3# containing the EcoRI site and the down-\nstream primer 5#-GCAAGCTTTTATTTTAGCATA-\nGATCT-3# containing the HindIII site. Following\ndigestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the PCR product\nwas subcloned into the vector pBAD/His B (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA) for expression as a His-tagged protein,\nnamed as pBAD-GoIL-2. The pBAD-GoIL-2 plasmid\nwas transformed into competent E. coli LMG194 cells\n(Invitrogen) and the transformants were screened on LB\nplates for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA from\nresistant colonies was identified and sequenced to\ndetermine the size and orientation of the insert. His-\nGoIL-2 expression was induced by the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocols, and checked by SDS-PAGE as described\npreviously by Zhou et al. [40]. For the purification of\nthe soluble recombinant His-GoIL-2 (rGoIL-2), the\nbacterial pellet was suspended in buffer B (100 mM\nNaH2PO4, 10 mM TriseCl, 8 M urea, pH 8.0) and lysed\nthoroughly by sonication on ice. The lysate was\ncentrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at room tempera-\nture (RT). Then the supernatant was collected and\napplied to a nickel column (Qiagen) to purify histidine-\ntagged proteins according to the manufacturer\u2019s in-\nstructions. The concentration of the purified rGoIL-2\nwas determined spectroscopically at 595 nm using a\nprotein assay kit based on the Bradford reagent (Biorad,\nHercules, CA). Western blot analysis of the expressed\nrGoIL-2 protein was checked as previously described by\nZhou et al. [40] with anti-X-press\ufffd mAb (Invitrogen),\nanti-human IL-2 mAb (Bender Medsystem Gmbh,\nAustria), and anti-DuIL-2 mAbs [26], anti-mouse\nIL-2 mAb (R&D systems Inc., U.S.A), anti-ChIL-2\nmAbs [41].\n\nTo prepare native soluble His-GoIL-2 for prolifera-\ntion assay, the bacterial pellet was washed with PBS (pH\n7.2) for three times and resuspended in lysis buffer\n(50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM\nimidazole) at 2e5 ml per gram wet weight with 0.01%\nTriton-X 100, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed entirely\nunder 37 \ufffdC water bath and sonicated on ice for three\n30 s pulses with intervening 20 s pauses. The lysed cells\nwere centrifuged at 10,000! g for 20 min at 4 \ufffdC. The\nrGoIL-2 was purified under native conditions from the\nresulting supernatant by the above-mentioned nickel\ncolumn. The purified rGoIL-2 was dialyzed against PBS,\nconcentrated using the PEG 6000. Polymixin B Sephar-\nose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to remove LPS\nfrom the purified proteins. The bacterial protein from\nE. coli LMG194 strain transformed with empty pBAD/\nHis B vector were prepared and used as protein control.\n\n4.4. Production and characterization of monoclonal\nand polyclonal antibodies to GoIL-2\n\nMAbs specific for rGoIL-2 were obtained by immu-\nnizingmice with purified rGoIL-2 as described previously\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/\nhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk./services/\n\n\n336 J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\n[26,40]. Briefly, the spleen cells isolated from immunized\nmice were fused with the sp2/0 myeloma cells by standard\nmethods. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for\nspecific binding to rGoIL-2 by the indirect ELISA as\ndescribed earlier [19], using 6!His, cell lysate of E. coli\nLMG194, rDuIL-2 [26], rChIL-2 [41] and rGoIL-2 as\nantigens. Hybridomas secreting mAbs to GoIL-2 were\nisolated and cloned by limiting dilution for acites\nproduction. The isotypes of the mAbs were determined\nusing a commercial kit (Southern Biotechnology Asso-\nciates, Inc., Birmingham, AL 35260, USA). Western blot\nanalysis of mAbs to rGoIL-2 was screened as the above-\nmentioned method.\n\nAnti-rGoIL-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) was\ngenerated by bi-weekly immunization of NZW rabbits\nwith rGoIL-2-CFA emulsion (100 mg of rGoIL-2 per\nrabbit). Immunized rabbits were bled 14 days after last\ninjection and the serum was collected.\n\n4.5. Preparation of endogenous GoIL-2 protein\n\nThe suspensions of the goose SMC were prepared as\nthe method mentioned above. Goose SMC were diluted\nto 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS\nand 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 \ufffdC in 5% CO2\nfor 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48,72 and 96 h. At each time point,\nthe residual Con A was moved by incubating with 0.1 M\na-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,\nUSA) for 30 min and the supernatant was harvested by\ncentrifugation at 10,000! g for 10 min at 4 \ufffdC.\n\n4.6. Antigen (Ag)-capture ELISA for GoIL-2\n\nFor quantification of rGoIL-2 expressed in E. coli\nand endogenous GoIL-2 in supernatants from Con A-\nstimulated SMC, an Ag-capture ELISA was developed\nwith certain modifications as described previously [20].\nBriefly mAbs and pAb to GoIL-2 were purified by fast\nprotein liquid chromatography (AmershamePharmacia\nBiotech, Piscataway, NJ), and rGoIL-2 purified under\ndenaturing conditions was used as a reference protein.\nNinety-six-well flat-bottom plates (NUNC, Denmark)\nwere coated with mAb (10 mg/ml, 100 ml/well) to GoIL-2\nin 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at 37 \ufffdC for 1 h\nfollowed at 4 \ufffdC overnight. Each well was blocked with\n200 ml PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at RT followed\nby three washes with 0.05 M PBST (PBS containing\n0.01% Tween 20). One hundred microlitres of culture\nsupernatant from Con A-stimulated SMC or protein\npreparations containing rGoIL-2 was added to each well\nand incubated for 4 h at RT. pAb to rGoIL-2 (100 ml/\nwell) in PBSe0.1% BSA was added and incubated for\n1 h at RT after five washes. After incubation with HRP-\nlabeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry\nLaboratories, Inc., Maryland, USA) for 30 min at RT.\nPeroxidase activity was detected by adding 100 ml/well\nof o-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml in 0.05 M PBS, pH\n5.0) substrate (Sigma) incubated for 15 min, and re-\naction was stopped by the addition of 50 ml of 2 M\nsulfate acid. Reactions were monitored by an automated\nmicrotiter plate reader at 490 nm.\n\n4.7. Construction of eukaryotic expression vector,\ntransfection and immunocytochemical staining\n\nThe GoIL-2 ORF with the signal peptide sequence\nwas amplified by PCR using the upstream primer\n5#-GCGAATTCATGATGTGCAAAGTACTGATC3-#\ncontaining the EcoRI site and downstream primer\n5#-TTGGATCCTTTTTGCAGATATCTCAC-3# con-\ntaining the BamHI site. The PCR product was subcloned\ninto the pEGFP-c2 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech,\nPalo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. The resulting plasmid pEGFP-GoIL-2 was trans-\nfected into the vero cells which had been seeded into\n24-well plates (1! 105 cells/well) using a commercially\navailable lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 mg/ml, Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco). The cells\nwere examinedunder an inverted fluorescencemicroscope\n3 h post-transfection. Then the cells were fixed with 80%\ncold acetone at \ufffd20 \ufffdC. After washing three times with\nPBS, the cells were blocked for 1 h at 37 \ufffdCwith 5% skim\nmilk and 0.1%Triton-X 100 in PBST. The cells were then\nincubated with the mAbs to rGoIL-2 diluted in PBST\ncontaining 2% skim milk for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC. Washed three\ntimes with PBST, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC\nwith HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard &\nPerry Laboratories). Color development was carried out\nwith 9-aminoethyl carbazole (Sigma) and hydrogen\nperoxide in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The\ncell expressed GoIL-2 was stained reddish-brown in this\nassay.\n\n4.8. Bioassay and neutralization\n\nLymphocyte proliferation induced by rGoIL-2 was\ndetected by MTT test [42]. Briefly, SMC from the\nchickens, ducks and gooses were, respectively, sus-\npended at 1! 107 cells/ml in RPMI-1640eFCS con-\ntaining 10 mg/ml Con A, and incubated at 40 \ufffdC in 5%\nCO2 for 24 h. SMC stimulated by Con A for 24 h were\nincubated in RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.1 M\na-methyl-D-mannoside (Sigma) at 40 \ufffdC for 30 min.\nThe cells were applied to Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) and\nlive cells were selected after centrifugation. The enriched\nviable cell population was resuspended in RPMI-1640\ncontaining 10% FCS and cultured at 5! 106 cells/ml\nwith the supernatant containing endogenous GoIL-2 as\nwell as rGoIL-2 proteins in triplicates in 96-well micro-\ntiter plates (100 ml/well, Costar, Corning, NY, USA).\nThe cells containing RPMI-1640eFCS and protein\ncontrol from E. coli LMG194 strain transformed with\n\n\n\n337J.-Y. Zhou et al. / Cytokine 30 (2005) 328e338\npBAD/His B vector alone were used as negative controls.\nAfter incubation at 40 \ufffdC for 48 h, 20 ml MTT (5 mg/ml)\nwas added to each well and reacted for 4 h. One hundred\nmicrolitres of lysis buffer (10% SDSe0.01 mol/l HCl)\nwas added to each well. Plates were incubated for 20 h at\n40 \ufffdC under 5% CO2 and OD value was measured at\n570 nm. ODGoIL-2/ODnegative value of 1.5 or above was\ndefined as the positive criteria for the biological activity\nof rGoIL-2.\n\nNeutralizing capacity of mAbs and pAb to rGoIL-2\nwas screened in 96-well plates as describedpreviouslywith\nmodifications [43]. Briefly, by fixing rGoIL-2 with anti-\nbodies in different concentrations, His-GoIL-2 (1.6 ng/\nwell) and supernatant of Con A-stimulated goose SMC\n(100 ml/well) was mixed, respectively, with an equal\nvolume of serial 10-fold dilutions of mAbs or pAb and\nincubated for 1 h at 37 \ufffdC. One hundred microlitres of\ncells (5! 106 cells/ml) stimulated by ConA for 24 h were\nadded to each well. Non-immunized rabbit serum and\nmAb to spike protein of IBV [40] were used as negative\ncontrols. Cultures were incubated for 48 h at 40 \ufffdC and\ncell proliferation was measured as above. The percent\nneutralizing ability of monoclonal and polyclonal anti-\nbodies against rGoIL-2 was calculated with the formula\nas described by Zhou et al. [27].\n\n4.9. Goose immunization and antibody detection\n\nForty-five day-old Eastern Zhejiang white gooses were\ndivided into five groups, with 10 gooses per group. After\nGroup 1, Group 2 and Group 3 gooses were each\nintramuscularly and, respectively, injected with a dose\nof 250 ng, 300 ng and 350 ng rGoIL-2, all gooses were\nimmunized intramuscularly with the commercial inacti-\nvated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus\naccording to the manufacture\u2019s instruction at once [AIV\n(H9N2), Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese\nAcademy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China].\nGooses in Group 4 only were each intramuscularly\nvaccinated with the inactivated AIV oil emulsion vaccine\n(H9N2), while gooses in the 5th Group were each\nintramuscularly immunized with the oil adjuvant as\na control. Under the same feeding condition, blood\nsamples were collected via wing vein puncture at 1, 2, 3\nand 4 weeks after immunization.

Baicalein (BE), a flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, possesses anti-\ninflammatory properties. However, whether BE can selectively induce apoptosis in activated lymphocytes and exert\ntherapeutic effect on AIH has not been studied.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: The pro-apoptotic properties of BE were evaluated in vitro on different types of immune\ncells, and in vivo effects of BE were examined in a murine model of Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. In vitro\ntreatment with BE resulted in a higher increase in the level of apoptosis in Con A-stimulated murine splenocytes, Con A-\nstimulated CD3+ splenocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated CD19+ splenocytes, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/\nionomycin-stimulated Jurkat T cells, compared with that in unstimulated na\u0131\u0308ve ones. Murine bone marrow-derived dentritic\ncells, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells, either stimulated with LPS or unstimulated, were all insensitive to the\nBE-induced apoptosis. BE treatment also led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of cytochrome c\nrelease from mitochondria to the cytosol, a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and activation of caspase-9,-3 in Con A-\nstimulated CD3+ splenocytes and LPS-stimulated CD19+ splenocytes, while showing no impact on Fas/FasL expressions and\ncaspase-8 activation. In vivo administration of BE alleviated Con A-induced liver injury, suppressed serum level of TNF-a and\nIFN-c, and reduced liver infiltration of mononuclear cells (MNCs). Furthermore, BE treatment increased the incidences of\napoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3+ and CD19+ splenocytes. When liver MNCs and\nsplenocytes from BE-treated mice were cultured in vitro for 24 h, they exhibited marked increase in apoptosis compared to\nvehicle-treated control.\n\nConclusions/Significance: The present study demonstrates the ability of BE to promote apoptosis in activated lymphocytes\nthrough mitochondrial pathway and its potential use in the treatment of AIH.\n\nCitation: Zhang Y, Shan L, Hua Y, Wang D, Zeng H, et al.

These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disease characterized by\n\nprogressive liver inflammation of unknown etiology that may\n\nadvance to fibrosis and cirrhosis [1]. The pathogenic mechanisms\n\nof AIH still remain unclear. The liver inflammation in AIH\n\nencompasses both cell-mediated cytotoxicity by infiltrating lym-\n\nphocytes and the production of autoantibodies. Therefore,\n\nabnormality in immune regulation is thought to be implicated in\n\nthe pathogenesis of this disease [2]. Currently, the only viable\n\ntreatments of AIH are immunosuppressant application and liver\n\ntransplantation. But long term applications of currently available\n\nimmunosuppressive drugs carries serious risks [3]. Therefore, it is\n\nsignificantly important to develop new specific drugs.\n\nDeletion of activated and autoreactive lymphocytes by apoptosis\n\nis a critical mechanism by which the immune system maintains\n\nhomeostasis [4,5]. There is increasing evidence that abnormalities\n\nin this process might contribute to the development of AIH. It has\n\nbeen reported that the activated lymphocytes in patients with AIH\n\nfail to down-regulate the expression of the antiapoptotic protein,\n\nbcl-2, which may protect them from apoptosis and thereby extend\n\nthe disease process [6]. Fas/Fas-ligand system is known to plays a\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592\n\n\n\nkey role in the control of activation-induced apoptosis of\n\nlymphocytes [7]. Four polymorphisms of human Fas gene have\n\nbeen associated with the occurrence of AIH in Japan [8], and one\n\npolymorphism in the Fas gene promoter at position 2670 has\n\nbeen associated with the early development of cirrhosis in white\n\nNorth American and Northern European patients with AIH [9].\n\nThese data suggests that genetic factors that affect the integrity of\n\nthe apoptotic pathway can influence the progression of AIH\n\npossibly by perpetuating the survival of activated lymphocytes.\n\nConcanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis is considered to be an\n\nexperimental murine model of AIH [10,11]. A previous study\n\ndemonstrated that CD44-knockout mice exhibited enhanced\n\npathogenesis in Con A-induced hepatitis, primarily due to inability\n\nof Con A-activated CD44-deficient T cells to undergo apoptosis\n\n[11]. A more recent study demonstrated that Galectin-3 deficiency\n\nprevents Con A-induced hepatitis partly due to enhanced\n\napoptosis in both liver-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs) and\n\nsplenocytes [12]. These evidence further support the notion that\n\ndysregulation of apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is involved in\n\nthe pathogenesis of AIH.\n\nSince insufficient apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is an\n\nessential factor contributing to the development of AIH, specific\n\ninduction of apoptosis in activated lymphocyte should be\n\nbeneficial in depressing excess immune responses and inducing\n\nlong-lasting immunological tolerance, and thus represents a new\n\ntherapeutic strategy for AIH. Recently, a few compounds have\n\nbeen reported to selectively induce or potentiate apoptosis in\n\nactivated T cells and inhibit the development of autoimmune\n\ndiseases in several animal models, including experimental allergic\n\nencephalitis [13,14], adjuvant arthritis [13], and Con A-induced\n\nhepatitis [15]. These studies further demonstrated the feasibility of\n\ntreatment of autoimmune diseases by agents that induce apoptosis\n\nof activated T cells.\n\nNatural compounds purified from herbal medicines that have\n\nknown indications for inflammatory disease conditions often have\n\na low toxicity profile [16,17]. Therefore, exploring new immuno-\n\nsuppressive agents that selectively induce apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes from herbal medicines is conducive to the develop-\n\nment of novel effective pharmaceuticals for AIH. Baicalein (BE) is\n\na flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis\n\nGeorgi, known as \u2018\u2018Huang qin\u2019\u2019 in China [18]. This herb has been\n\nwidely used in treatment of various diseases such as hepatitis,\n\npneumonia, and diarrhea [19]. Previous studies have demonstrat-\n\ned that BE possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties [20\u201325].\n\nHowever, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated.\n\nOf note, BE has been reported to induce apoptosis in several\n\ncancer cell lines, including human pancreatic [26], breast [27],\n\nprostate [28], and gastric [29] cancer cells. The pro-apoptotic\n\neffects of BE on both lymphocytes cell line and human peripheral\n\nblood mononuclear cells has also been shown previously [30,31].\n\nHowever, whether it can selectively induce apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes has not been studied. In present study, we at first\n\nconducted a series of in vitro experiments to investigate the pro-\n\napoptotic effect of BE on various immunocytes of different\n\nactivating status, and then used Con A-induced hepatitic mice as\n\nan animal model to determine whether BE could induce\n\nlymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has therapeutic potential for\n\nAIH. We demonstrated that BE selectively induced apoptosis in\n\nactivated lymphocytes and ameliorated Con A-induced hepatitis in\n\nmice. Our findings indicate that BE may have a therapeutic value\n\nin the treatment of AIH and provides a new cellular mechanism\n\nfor its therapeutic effect.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics Statement\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Administrative\n\nCommittee of Experimental Animal Care and Use of Second\n\nMilitary Medical University (SMMU, Licence No. 2011023), and\n\nconformed to the National Institute of Health guidelines on the\n\nethical use of animals.\n\nReagents\nBE (purity .99%) was purchased from National Institute for\n\nthe Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, China.\n\nCon A, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate\n\n(PMA), and ionomycine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,\n\nMO, USA). PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (PE-mAbs)\n\nrecognizing CD3, CD19, Fas, or FasL and FITC-conjugated mAb\n\nagainst active caspase-3 were purchased from BD PharMingen.\n\nMice\nC57BL/6 mice (6-week-old, female) were purchased from\n\nShanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., LTD (Shanghai, China).\n\nAll animals were acclimatized under controlled temperature\n\n(2062uC), humidity (6065%) and 12 h light/12 h dark cycle for\n1 week before the experiment.\n\nCell Preparation and Culture\nAll cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma)\n\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37uC in a\n5% CO2 atmosphere. Splenocytes were prepared by passing\n\ndisrupted spleen collected from C57BL/6 mice through a 70-mm\nnylon cell strainer (BD Labware), and depleting red blood cells by\n\n5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/\n\nvolume]). CD3+ cells and CD19+ cells were isolated from\n\nsplenocytes by magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS)-based\n\npurification using Pan T Cell Isolation Kit and B Cell Isolation Kit\n\n(Miltenyi Biotec), respectively, according to the manufacturer\u2019s\n\ninstructions, and the purity of obtain cells was more than 95% as\n\ndetermined by flow cytometry. Bone marrow (BM) cells were\n\nprepared by flushing the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, filtering\n\nthrough a 70-mm nylon cell strainer, and depleting red blood cells\nby 5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/\n\nvolume]). Dendritic cells (DCs) were generated by culturing BM\n\ncells with 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse granulocyte-macro-\n\nphage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (both from R&D\n\nSystems) for 6 days as previously described [32]. To stimulate DCs\n\nmaturation, LPS (500 ng/ml) was added to the culture on day 5.\n\nPeritoneal macrophages were obtained by plating cells lavaged\n\nfrom the mouse peritoneal cavity in 24-well flat-bottomed plates\n\nand removing nonadherent cells after 3 hours of culture [33]. The\n\nobtained macrophages were stimulated with LPS (500 ng/ml) for\n\nadditional 24 h to activated them. Jurkat T cells and Raw264.7\n\nmacrophage cells were stimulated for 24 h with PMA (25 ng/\n\nmL)/ionomycin (1 mM) and LPS (500 ng/ml), respectively, to\ninduce their activation.\n\nApoptosis Assay\nCells were stained with FITC-labeled annexin V (annexin V-\n\nFITC) and propidium iodide (PI) (BD PharMingen, San Diego,\n\nCalifornia, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\n\nanalyzed in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San\n\nJose, CA, USA). The percentages of apoptotic cells were\n\ndetermined as the sum of annexin V-FITC single-positive and\n\nannexin V-FITC/PI double-positive cells. In some experiments,\n\nCaspase-3 activation was determined using the FITC Active\n\nBaicalein Induces Apoptosis in Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592\n\n\n\nCaspase-3 Apoptosis kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA)\n\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, the cells\n\nwere fixed and permeabilized by adding 100 ml Cytofix/cytoperm\nsolution at 4uC for 20 min, and the cells were then washed with\nPerm/Wash solution. The cells were stained intracellularly with\n\nFITC-conjugated anti-active caspase-3 antibody for 30 min at\n\nroom temperature and subsequently analyzed by FACS Calibur\n\nFlow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nAssay for Expression of Fas and FasL\nExpression of Fas and FasL on lymphocytes was examined by\n\nflow cytometry after staining the cells with PE-conjugated mAb\n\nrecognizing Fas or FasL (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego,\n\nCA, USA ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nAssay for Mitochondrial Membrane Potential\nLoss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) was deter-\n\nmined by flow cytometry using J-aggregate forming lipophilic\n\ncationic probe JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)\n\nstaining following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\n\nSubcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting\nThe preparation of whole cell lysates and mitochondrial and\n\ncytosolic fractions were performed as detailed previously [34]. The\n\nprotein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-\n\nRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The proteins (20 mg) were separated by\nSDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF\n\nmembrane (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). The membranes\n\nwere probed with anti-cytochrome c, anti-COX IV, anti-a-\ntubulin, Anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, and anti-b-actin antibodies (Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 4uC. Blots were\nvisualized using IRDye 800CW Goat Anti-Mouse Secondary\n\nAntibody (LI-COR Biotechnology, NE, USA). Detection was\n\nperformed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR\n\nBiotechnology, NE, USA).\n\nCaspase-3,8,9 Colorimetric Assay\nThe activation of caspase-3,8,9 in the cells was measured with\n\ncolorimetric assay kits (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\n\nprotocol. The caspase activity was expressed as a fold increase of\n\ntest samples relative to non-treatment control.\n\nCon A-induced Hepatitis Model\nHepatic damage was induced by a single intravenous injection\n\nof Con A (15 mg/kg) into C57BL/6 mice. BE was administered\n\nintraperitoneally (i.p.) (100 mg/kg) immediately after Con A\n\ninjection. Control mice were given i.p. the same volume of solvent\n\ninstead of BE. Blood samples were collected from mice at 0, 8, and\n\n24 h after Con A injection. Serum levels of alanine aminotransa-\n\nminase (ALT) were measured using a colorimetric assay kit\n\n(Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).\n\nSerum levels of IFN-c, TNF-a, and IL-4 were measured using\nELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\n\ntions. For histological analysis, livers were collected at 24 h after\n\nCon A injection. Liver samples were fixed in 10% formalin\n\nsolution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with\n\nhematoxylin-eosin. To detect the in vivo apoptosis in lymphocytes,\n\nthe liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes were isolated 24 h\n\nafter Con A injection as described previously [35], and stained for\n\ndifferent markers of cell subsets (CD3 and CD19) or with FITC-\n\nannexin/PI. The stained cells were counted using a BD FACS\n\nCalibur flow cytometer. In some experiments, the liver MNCs and\n\nsplenocytes were harvested at 8 after Con A injection. The cells\n\nobtained from each mouse were firstly cultured in 24-well flat-\n\nbottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophage adherence, then the\n\nnonadherent cells were collected and further cultured in vitro for 12\n\nand 24 h, and the percentages of apoptosis at each time point were\n\ndetermined by flow cytometry using FITC-annexin V/PI staining.\n\nAfter 24 hours of in vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptotic\n\ncells in total nonadherent cells derived from liver MNCs and\n\nsplenocytes, as well as in CD3+ T cell and CD19+ B cell subsets,\n\nwere measured by cell counting and flow cytometry using PE-anti-\n\nCD3/FITC-annexin V staining and PE-anti-CD19/FITC-an-\n\nnexin V staining, respectively.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. Statistical analysis was\n\nperformed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test,\n\nfollowed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison post hoc test. P values\n\nless than 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nResults\n\nBE Selectively Induces Apoptosis in Mitogen-activated\nLymphocytes\n\nThe pro-apoptotic effect of BE was at first tested on splenocytes.\n\nTo determine whether BE may exert differential effects on\n\nactivated and na\u0131\u0308ve immune cells, freshly isolated murine\n\nsplenocytes were cultured with BE (5\u201320 mM) for 24 h in the\npresence or absence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and cell death was\ndetermined using Annexin V/PI staining. The result revealed an\n\nincrease in the number of apoptotic events in splenocyte cultures\n\nupon BE treatment. Of note, the increase in the levels of apoptosis\n\nin splenocyte cultures containing both Con A and BE were\n\nmarkedly higher than that in the corresponding levels detected for\n\nthe same concentrations of BE when the cells were incubated with\n\nBE alone (Fig. 1). This result indicated that BE is more effective in\n\ninducing apoptosis in mitogen-activated splenocytes than in na\u0131\u0308ve\n\nones.\n\nWe next compared the abilities of BE to induced apoptosis in\n\ndifferent types of immune cells under different activating status. In\n\nthis experiment, CD3+ cells and CD19+ cells were purified from\n\nmurine splenocytes and were used as T and B lymphocytes,\n\nrespectively. DCs were derived from murine BM cells and\n\nmacrophages were obtained from murine peritoneal exudate cells.\n\nBesides these primary immune cells, Jurkat T cell line and\n\nRAW264.7 cell line were also included in this experiment. For\n\ninduction of cell activation, splenocytes and T lymphocytes were\n\nstimulated with 5 mg/ml of Con A; B lymphocytes, BM-derived\nDCs, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were stimu-\n\nlated with 500 ng/ml of LPS; Jurkat T cells were stimulated with\n\n25 ng/mL of PMA plus 1 mM of ionomycin. All of these cells were\ncultured with 10 mM of BE for 24 h in the presence or absence of\nthe respective activator and cell apoptosis was determined using\n\nAnnexin V/PI staining. Because the spontaneous apoptosis levels\n\nwere different among various types of cells, the pro-apoptotic\n\neffects of BE were indicated as increase in the percentages of\n\napoptosis in each type of cells upon BE exposure. As shown in\n\nFig. 2A, BE exposure resulted in a significantly higher increase in\n\nthe level of apoptosis in splenocytes, CD3+ splenocytes, CD19+\n\nsplenocytes, and Jurkat cells in the presence of activator compared\n\nwith that in the absence of activator. However, BE, either alone or\n\nin the presence of LPS, only induced a slight and similar increase\n\nof apoptosis in DCs, and induced almost no increase in peritoneal\n\nmacrophages and RAW264.7 cells. This result suggested BE could\n\nselectively induced the apoptosis in activated T and B lympho-\n\ncytes. We further determine the dose-dependency of BE in\n\nBaicalein Induces Apoptosis in Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592\n\n\n\ninducing apoptosis of lymphocytes by incubating CD3+ spleno-\n\ncytes, CD19+ splenocytes, or Jurkat cells with increasing concen-\n\ntrations of BE for 24 hours in the absence or presence of the\n\nrespective activator and subsequently analyzing apoptosis. The\n\nresults indicated BE enhanced the apoptosis of these tested cells in\n\na dose-dependent manner within the range of 5\u201320 mM much\nmore profoundly in the presence of activator than in the absence\n\nof activator (Fig. 2B). Taken together, above results demonstrated\n\nthat activated T and B cells are more sensitive to BE-induced\n\napoptosis than na\u0131\u0308ve ones, whereas DCs and macrophages, either\n\nactivated or na\u0131\u0308ve, are insensitive to BE-induced apoptosis.\n\nBE Induces Apoptosis in Activated Lymphocytes through\nMitochondrial Pathway\n\nIn order to dissect possible pathway involved in BE-induced\n\napoptosis in lymphocytes, we next investigated the effects of BE on\n\nthe expressions of Fas/FasL, loss of DYm, and activation of\ncaspases in immunobead-purified CD3+ splenocytes in the absence\n\nor presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A. Consistent with the result in\nFig. 2B, BE (5\u201320 mM) markedly increased the percentage of\napoptotic (annexin V+) cells dose-dependently in the presence of\n\nCon A, while only showing slight effects in the absence of Con A\n\n(Fig. 3 A\u2013C). At the same time, even though the presence of Con\n\nA resulted in a small increase in the expressions of Fas and FasL,\n\nthey are not further affected by BE treatment (Fig. 3A, B, D, and\n\nE). However, BE treatment led to a much more profound loss of\n\nDYm in T cells in the presence of Con A than in the absence of\nCon A (Fig. 3F and G). With the loss of DYm, the release of\ncytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol was markedly\n\nincreased in T cells upon BE treatment in the presence of Con\n\nA (Fig. 3H). In addition, BE treatment also resulted in a down-\n\nregulation in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and an\n\nup-regulation in the level of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, in T\n\ncells in the presence of Con A (Fig. 3I). The colorimetric assay for\n\ncaspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presence of Con A,\n\nBE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23 rather than\n\ncaspase-8 in T cells (Fig. 3J). These results not only confirmed the\n\nselectively pro-apoptotic effects of BE on activated T cells but also\n\nindicated that BE exerts it effects through mitochondrial pathway\n\nrather than death-receptor-mediated pathway.\n\nWe also tested the expressions of Fas and FasL in immunobead-\n\npurified CD19+ splenocytes which were treated with increasing\n\nconcentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of\n\n10 mg/ml of LPS, and found that they were not influenced by BE\ntreatment (data not shown). However, flow cytometry analysis\n\nshowed that treatment with BE increased the percentage of cells\n\nwith low DYm (Fig. 4A and B) and active caspase-3+ cells (Fig. 4C\nand D) in CD19+ cells much more profoundly in the presence of\n\nLPS than in the absence of LPS. Western blotting assays showed\n\nthat the release of cytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol in\n\nB cells after BE treatment in the presence of LPS was marked\n\nincreased (Fig. 4E). BE treatment also resulted in a down-\n\nregulation in the levels of Bcl-2 and an up-regulation in the level of\n\nBax in B cells in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4F). The colorimetric\n\nassay for caspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presence\n\nof LPS, BE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23\n\nrather than caspase-8 in B cells (Fig. 4G). These results further\n\nconfirmed BE selectively promotes apoptosis of activated B cells\n\nthrough mitochondrial pathway.\n\nAdministration of BE Attenuated Con A-induced\nHepatitis and Enhanced Apoptosis of Lymphocytes in\nLiver-infiltrating MNCs and Splenocytes\n\nThe finding that BE selectively induces apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes in vitro prompted us to further investigate whether BE\n\ncould also induce lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has anti-\n\nhepatitis potential using a Con A-induced hepatitis model. As\n\nshown in Fig. 5, intravenous administration of Con A resulted in a\n\nsignificant elevation in the serum ALT level at 8 and 24 h after\n\nCon A administration. BE treatment significantly reduced the\n\nALT concentrations at both time points (Fig. 5A). Serum levels of\n\nIFN-c and TNF-a were also enhanced in response to Con A\nchallenge after 8 h, which were all suppressed by BE treatment\n\n(Fig. 5B). Histologic examination of liver sections showed that Con\n\nA challenge resulted in widespread areas of necrosis and massive\n\ninfiltration of inflammatory cells in livers 24 h after Con A\n\nadministration. Treatment with BE markedly attenuated these\n\npathologic changes (Fig. 5C). Flow cytometry analysis of hepatic\n\nMNCs showed that the total numbers of liver infiltrating MNCs,\n\nCD3+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells were significantly lower in BE-\n\ntreated mice, compared to mice treated with Con A only, 24 hours\n\nFigure 1. BE preferentially induces apoptosis in mitogen-activated splennocytes. Murine splenocytes were treated with indicated\nconcentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and the percentages of apoptosis were detected using Annexin V/PI\nstaining.

Hypothesizing that the reduced\n\nnumbers of MNCs in the BE treated livers might reflect an\n\nincreased incidence of apoptosis, we analyzed the incidence of\n\napoptosis among the hepatic MNCs harvested at 24 h after Con A\n\ninjection with flow cytometry and found that the frequency of\n\napoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs significantly increased upon\n\nBE treatment (Fig. 5E). Further flow cytometry analysis of freshly\n\nisolated splenocytes demonstrated the percentages of apoptotic\n\n(Annexin V+) cells in splenocytes, splenic CD3+ T cells, and\n\nCD19+ B cell were significantly higher in BE-treated mice than\n\nthat in mice received Con A only (Fig. 5F and G). However, we\n\nnoticed that the frequency of apoptosis in liver MNCs only\n\nincreased from 23.5% to 29.0% upon BE treatment (Fig. 5E),\n\nwhile the total cell numbers of liver MNCs dramatically decreased\n\nfrom 21.86105 cells per liver decreased to 11.56105 cells per liver\nupon BE treatment (Fig. 5D). Thus the absolute number of\n\napoptotic MNCs was calculated to be fewer in BE-treated livers\n\nwhen compared to Con A only control. Nevertheless, it should be\n\nnoted that, as cells undergo apoptosis, they are recognized and\n\nrapidly cleared in vivo by phagocytic macrophages [36,37]. Thus,\n\nthe flow cytometry data in Fig. 5E did not take into consideration\n\nthe majority of the cells that had died and had been cleared in vivo,\n\nbut only represented the incidence of apoptosis among liver MNCs\n\nthat were undergoing apoptosis but had not been cleared at the\n\ntime point that the cells were harvested (24 h after Con A and BE\n\nadministration). To overcome the problem of apoptotic cells being\n\ncleared in vivo, we did ex vivo experiments in which we harvested\n\nthe hepatic MNCs and splenocytes at early stage of BE\n\nadministration (within 8 h) and cultured them in 24-well flat-\n\nbottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophages adherence, then the\n\nnonadherent cells were collected and further cultured for 12 and\n\n24 h to investigate whether these cells would then undergo\n\nincreased apoptosis in vitro in the absence of macrophages. The\n\nresults showed that during the in vitro culture period, the frequency\n\nof apoptotic cells raised more readily in the macrophage-depleted\n\nlive MNCs and splenocytes obtained from mice treated with Con\n\nA and BE than in the cells from mice treated with Con A only, so\n\nthat by 24 h of in vitro culture, the increase in the frequency of\n\napoptotic cells in Con A+BE group became more apparent\ncompared with Con A only control (Fig. 6A). At this time point of\n\nin vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells detected in\n\nmacrophage-depleted live MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in\n\nCD3+ T cell and CD19+ B cells subsets, were significantly higher\n\nin Con A+BE group than in Con A only control (Fig. 6B). These\nresults indicated that lymphocytes exposed to BE in vivo undergo\n\nincreased apoptosis when cultured in vitro, suggesting that in vivo\n\nexposure of lymphocytes to BE makes them more susceptible to\n\napoptosis. These results support the notion that increased levels of\n\napoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction in\n\nMNCs within BE-treated livers. These data together suggested\n\nthat BE could also promote lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has\n\nanti-hepatitis potential.\n\nFigure 2. BE selectively induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes.

The direct\n\nand selective pro-apoptotic effects on activated T and B cells were\n\nfurther corroborated using MACS-purified CD3+ splenocytes and\n\nCD19+ splenocytes. We demonstrated that BE significantly\n\nenhanced the apoptosis in pure CD3+ splenocytes stimulated with\n\nCon A, while only having little effect on naive ones. Consistently,\n\nBE was found to be much more effective in inducing Jurkat T cells\n\nto undergo apoptosis in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. In\n\npure CD19+ splenocytes cultures that had been treated with BE\n\nand LPS, the level of apoptosis were greater when compared to\n\nthat in cultures that treated with BE alone. These results confirm\n\nthat BE might affect activated lymphocytes to a greater degree\n\nthan na\u0131\u0308ve lymphocytes. We also noted that murine BM-derived\n\nDCs, murine peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were\n\nall insensitive to the BE-induced apoptosis, either activated or\n\ninactivated. These results suggested that BE was able to selective\n\npromote apoptosis in activated T and B lymphocytes.\n\nApoptosis is mediated primarily through intrinsic and/or\n\nextrinsic pathways [38,39]. The intrinsic pathway involves altering\n\nmitochondrial permeability and subsequent cytochrome c release\n\nand formation of the apoptosome, a catalytic multiprotein\n\nplatform that activates caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 then cleaves\n\ncaspase-3 resulting in downstream events involved in cell death\n\n[38]. The extrinsic pathway is triggered with the ligation of death\n\nreceptors, followed by the recruitment of an adaptor molecule and\n\nprocaspase-8 to form a Death-Inducing Signaling Complex, which\n\nlead to the autocatalytic cleavage and subsequent activation of\n\ncaspase-8, and in turn activates caspase-3, leading to apoptosis\n\n[39]. Fas is a major death receptor that mediates apoptosis of\n\nactivated lymphocytes. Upon activation, lymphocytes can express\n\na higher level of Fas and are more susceptible to Fas-mediated\n\napoptosis than naive cells [7]. In this study, we observed that BE\n\ndid not affects the expressions of Fas and FasL on both T and B\n\nlymphocytes, either na\u0131\u0308ve or activated, but preferentially induced a\n\nloss of DYm in activated lymphocytes. BE treatment also led to the\nrelease of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, down-\n\nregulation of Bcl-2, and up-regulation of Bax in activated\n\nlymphocytes. Furthermore, Caspase-9 and caspase-3 but not\n\ncaspase-8 were activated in activated lymphocytes upon BE\n\ntreatment. These results indicated that BE induces apoptosis in\n\nactivated lymphocytes via intrinsic pathway rather than Fas-\n\nmediated extrinsic pathway.\n\nBE has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties on\n\nvarious animal models [21\u201325], but the related mechanisms are\n\nonly partially understood. Previous studies have associated its anti-\n\ninflammatory activities with activation of intestinal Pregnane X\n\nReceptor [25], suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine expres-\n\nsion [23,24], inhibition of nitric oxide production [21,40],\n\nimpairment of reactive oxygen intermediates production [20],\n\ninhibition of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [20], and\n\nmodification of eicosanoid synthesis [41]. Data from current study\n\nsuggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of BE can also be\n\nattributed, at least in part, to its ability to trigger apoptosis in\n\nactivated lymphocytes. This new finding not only extends our\n\nunderstanding on the cellular mechanisms underlying the anti-\n\ninflammatory activity of BE, but also raises the possibility that BE\n\nmay be useful to eliminate activated lymphocytes that contribute\n\nto autoimmune diseases.\n\nCon A-induced hepatitis in mice is a well-established mouse\n\nmodel for AIH. In this model, intravenous injection of Con A\n\nleads to systemic immune activation, resulting in acute liver injury\n\nthat resemble the pathology of immune mediated hepatitis in\n\nhumans [10]. Activated T cells have a critical role in Con A-\n\ninduced liver damage. Upon Con A challenge, T cells are initially\n\nactivated and infiltrate the liver tissue, where they induce\n\nhepatocyte death either by cell to cell contact or through secretion\n\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines, of which TNF-a and IFN-c are the\nmajor ones [42,43]. In the current study, in vivo administration of\n\nBE alleviated Con A-induced hepatitis as indicated by decreased\n\ntransaminase levels and markedly attenuated inflammatory lesions\n\nin liver. BE treatment also significantly suppressed Con A-\n\nmediated elevation in serum level of TNF-a and IFN-c, indicating\nCon A-induced immune activation was inhibited by BE.\n\nFurthermore, BE treatment markedly reduced MNCs infiltration\n\nin the liver and significantly lowered the absolute number of\n\nhepatic T and B lymphocytes. The reduction in hepatic MNCs\n\ncould possibly result from the decrease in MNCs recruitment into\n\nlivers and/or the increase in MNCs death and clearance within\n\nlivers. Since BE can selectively induced apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes in vitro, we assumed that enhanced apoptosis of\n\nlymphocytes may contribute to the reduction of MNCs in livers of\n\nBE-treated mice. Indeed, we found that BE treatment increased\n\nthe incidence of apoptosis among hepatic MNCs and splenocytes\n\nin Con A-challenged mice. Flow cytometry assay of annexin V\n\nexposure in splenic T and B cells further confirmed that the\n\nfrequency of splenic T and B lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis\n\nwas increased in ConA-injected mice upon BE treatment.\n\nFurthermore, our ex vivo experiments demonstrated that when\n\nliver MNCs and splenocytes harvested from mice treated with Con\n\nA and BE were cultured in vitro for 24 h, both the frequencies of\n\napoptosis and the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells in total liver\n\nMNCs and spelnocytes, as well as in CD3+ T cell and CD19+ B\n\ncell subsets, were significantly higher when compared to Con A\n\nonly control. These ex vivo data indicate that lymphocytes from BE-\n\ntreated mice become increasingly susceptible to apoptosis when\n\ncultured in vitro. Overall, these results suggest that higher level of\n\napoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction of\n\nMNCs in liver of BE-treated mice, which concur with in vitro\n\nevidence that BE drives activated lymphocytes to apoptosis.\n\nAlthough we cannot exclude the possibility that BE may execute\n\nFigure 3.

On the contrary, some ISDs such as\n\ncyclosporin A and FK506 even inhibited apoptosis in activated T\n\ncells by down-regulation of FasL [47]. Although dexamethasone is\n\nknown to induce apoptosis in various immune cells, it lack of\n\nselectivity for activated lymphocytes [48]. This is why the current\n\nISDs exert global suppressing effects on the immune system, which\n\npredispose patients to the development of infection and cancer.\n\nAlternatively, selective induction of apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes might effectively deplete autoreactive T and B cells\n\nwithout affecting na\u0131\u0308ve or non-activated ones to avoid intervention\n\nof normal immune responses to foreign antigens. In this context,\n\nBE would have distinct advantages over the unselective immuno-\n\nsuppressive agents currently used in the treatment of AIH.\n\nHowever, the practical uses of baicalein in pharmaceutical field\n\nwill depend on the success of attempts to enhance its oral\n\nbioavailability. Fortunately, several approaches have been recently\n\ndeveloped which could markedly improve the oral bioavailability\n\nof BE [49\u201351].\n\nIn conclusion, BE selectively promoted apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes through intrinsic apoptotic pathway, while having\n\nlittle effect on non-activated ones. Administration of BE alleviates\n\nCon A-induced hepatitis in mice and increased the incidences of\n\napoptosis in hepatic MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3+\n\nand CD19+ splenocytes, in Con A-challenged mice. These\n\nobservations not only reveal a novel cellular mechanism for the\n\nanti-inflammatory effects of BE, but also suggest that it has\n\ntherapeutic potential for AIH.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: YZ LS YH WZ ZH.

Murine hepatitis\nwas induced by an intravenous injection of Con A at a dose of 15 mg/kg. BE (100 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally immediately after Con A\ninjection. The liver MNCs and splenocytes were prepared at 8 h after Con A injection. After 2 hours of in-vitro culture, the adherent macrophages\nwere removed and the nonadherent cells were further cultured in vitro for 12 and 24 h. (A) The percentages of apoptosis in the in vitro cultured\nnonadherent cells at each time point were determined by flow cytometry using FITC-annexin V/PI staining. (B) After in vitro culture for 24 h, the\nabsolute numbers of apoptotic cells in liver MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3+ T cell and CD19+ B cell subsets, were determined by cell\ncounting and flow cytometry using PE-anti-CD3/FITC-annexin V staining and PE-anti-CD19/FITC-annexin V staining, respectively.

Antrodia cinnamomea (A. cinnamomea), a medicinal mushroom in Taiwan,\nhas shown antioxidant and anticancer activities. In this study, we first observed that ethanol extract of fruiting bodies of A. cinna-\nmomea (EEAC) exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on migration and motility of the highly metastatic CL1-5 cells\nin the absence of cytotoxicity. The results of a gelatin zymography assay showed that A. cinnamomea suppressed the activities of\nmatrix metalloproteinase-(MMP-) 2 and MMP-9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot results demonstrated that\ntreatment with A. cinnamomea decreased the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2; while the expression of the endogenous inhibitors\nof these proteins, that is, tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) increased. Further investigation revealed that A. cinnamo-\nmea suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2. A. cinnamomea also suppressed the expressions of PI3K and\nphosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, treatment of CL1-5 cells with inhibitors specific for PI3K (LY 294002), ERK1/2 (PD98059),\nJNK (SP600125), and p38 MAPK (SB203580) decreased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. This is the first paper confirming\nthe antimigration activity of this potentially beneficial mushroom against human lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cancer cells.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nLung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related\nmortality worldwide. In some countries, it has become the\nnumber one cancer cause of death, accounting for more\nfatalities than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal\ncancer combined [1]. Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines\nCL1-0, CL1-1, CL1-5, and CL1-5-F4 are a series of sub-\nlines with progressively invasive ability established by in vitro\ninvasion screening. CL1-5 cells are a human lung adeno-\ncarcinoma cell line derived from the parental CL1 cells by\nfive successive Matrigel selections. CL1-5 cells showed a 4-\n\nto 6-fold higher invasive ability than the parental cells and\ntheir production of 92-kDa MMP-9 also exhibited a drastic\nincrease over that of their parental cells.\n\nMetastasis is a characteristic of highly malignant cancers\nwith poor clinical outcome. Malignant tumor progression\ndepends upon the capacity to invade, metastasize, and pro-\nmote the angiogenic host response. One critical characteris-\ntic that metastatic cancer cells have acquired is the ability to\ndissolve basement membranes and the extracellular matrix\n(ECM). This degradative process is mediated largely by\nmatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are a large family\nof at least 20 zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases that\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\ntogether can degrade all known components of ECM [2].\nMMP-9 is abundantly expressed in various malignant tu-\nmors and is postulated to play a critical role in tumor inva-\nsion and angiogenesis [3]. Thus, the inhibition of MMP\nactivity, including MMP-9, is important for the prevention\nof cell invasion. CL1-5 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma\ncell line, expressed an elevated level of MMP-2, MMP-9\nand exhibited a highly invasive and metastatic ability [4, 5].\nMeanwhile, the activity of MMPs is prone to the inhibition of\nendogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs),\nwhich are specific inhibitors of MMPs, and the imbalance\nbetween MMPs and TIMPs may contribute to degradation or\ndeposition of ECM [6]. The mitogen-activated protein kina-\nses (MAPKs) play an important regulatory role in cell\ngrowth, differentiation, apoptosis, and metastasis [7]. In ad-\ndition, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/serine/threonine pro-\ntein kinase (or protein kinase B) (PI3K/Akt) signal trans-\nduction pathway is involved in the development, progression,\nand metastasis of various tumors [8\u201310].\n\nTraditionally, Antrodia cinnamomea (A. cinnamomea;\nalso named niu-chang-chih in Chinese) has been used as\na health food to prevent inflammation, hypertension, itchy\nskin, and liver cancer [11]. There is increasing evidence\nthat A. cinnamomea possesses an extensive range of bio-\nlogical activities, including the liver protection [12], anti-\ninflammation [13], and antioxidation [14]. Some reports\nhave suggested that extracts of mycelia and fruiting bodies\nof A. cinnamomea could be a potential chemotherapeutic\nagent against hepatoma, as well as prostate, breast, bladder,\nand lung cancer cells [15\u201320], the antimetastatic effect of\nA. cinnamomea in lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cancer cells\nis still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the\nantimetastatic effects of A. cinnamomea on a highly metas-\ntatic CL1-5 cell lines as well as the underlying mechanisms.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Chemicals. A. cinnamomea was kindly provided by Cos-\nmox Biomedical Co. Ltd. (Taoyuan, Taiwan). RPMI Medium\n1640, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium\nbromide (MTT), LY294002, SP600125, and SB203580 were\nobtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA).\nPD98059 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology\n(Beverly, MA, USA). Trypsin\u2212EDTA, fetal bovine serum\n(FBS), and penicillin/streptomycin were from Gibco Life\nTechnologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). Cell culture supplies were\npurchased from Costar (Corning, Inc., Cypress, CA, USA).\nThe antibody against AKT, Rac-1, MAPK/extracellular sig-\nnal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase\n(JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 MAPK pro-\nteins and phosphorylated proteins were purchased from Cell\nSignaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Anti-ERK1/2,\nanti-PI3K, antifocal adhesion kinase (FAK), anti-p-FAK,\nand horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG\nantibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology\nCo. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), \u03b2-actin was purchased from\nChemicon (Temecula, CA, USA).\n\n2.2. Preparation of Ethanol Extract of Fruiting Bodies of A. cin-\nnamomea (EEAC). The fruiting body of A. cinnamomea was\nkindly provided by Cosmox Biomedical Co. LTD (Taoyuan,\nTaiwan) and identified by Dr. Chao-Lin Kuo (School of\nChinese Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chinese Medicine\nResource, Taiwan). A. cinnamomea was weighed about 1 kg\nand soaked in 10 L of 95% ethanol solution (extractive sol-\nvent) for 3 days at room temperature. The solid residue of\nthe above soaked herbs was filtered and discarded through\na Buchner funnel lined with Whatman filter paper, and the\nfiltrate was concentrated to paste by vacuum distillation\nusing the rotary evaporator (N-11, EYELA; Tokyo, Japan)\nand vacuum controller (VC-760, TAKARA; Tokyo, Japan) to\nmaintain the desired pressure and temperature at 25\u25e6C with\n40 mmHg. The various concentration of EEAC was further\ndiluted with DMSO for the further use.\n\n2.3. Cell Culture. CL1-5 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr.\nW.-S. Wayne Chang (National Institute of Cancer Research,\nNational Health Research Institutes, Miaoli, Taiwan). The\ncells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand\nIsland, NY, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco)\nat 37\u25e6C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\n\n2.4. Cytotoxicity Assay. The cells (1\u00d7 105 cells/mL) were cul-\ntured in 96-well plate containing RPMI-1640 supplemented\nwith 10% FBS for 24 h to become nearly confluent. Then cells\nwere cultured with EEAC for 24 h and 36 h. Then, the cells\nwere washed twice with PBS and incubated with 100 \u03bcL of\n0.5 mg/mL MTT for 3 h at 37\u25e6C, testing for cell viability. The\nmedium was then discarded and 50 \u03bcL of dimethylsulfoxide\n(DMSO) was added. After 10 min incubation, absorbance at\n590 nm was read by a microplate reader.\n\n2.5. Wound-Healing Assay. For cell motility determination,\nCL1-5 cells (2 \u00d7 105 cells/mL) were seeded in a 12-well\ntissue culture plate and grown to 80\u221290% confluence. After\naspiration of the medium, the center of the cell monolayers\nwas scraped with a sterile micropipette tip to create a denu-\nded zone (gap) of constant width. Subsequently, cellular\ndebris was washed with PBS, and CL1-5 cells were exposed\nto various concentrations of EEAC (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5,\nand 1.0 \u03bcg/mL). Wound closure was monitored and photo-\ngraphed at 0 h and 36 h with a Nikon inverted microscope.\nTo quantify the migrated cells, pictures of the initial wounded\nmonolayers were compared with the corresponding pictures\nof cells at the end of the incubation. Artificial lines fitting the\ncutting edges were drawn on pictures of the original wounds\nand overlaid on the pictures of cultures after incubation.\nCells that had migrated across the white lines were counted\nin six random fields from each triplicate treatment.\n\n2.6. Cell Migration Assay. Tumor cell migration was assayed\nin transwell chambers (Millipore) according to the method\nreported by Weng et al. [6] with some modifications. Briefly,\ntranswell chambers with 6.5 mm polycarbonate filters of\n8 \u03bcm pore size were used. CL1-5 cells (1 \u00d7 104 cells/mL) and\n0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 \u03bcg/mL of EEAC were suspended\nin RPMI-1640 (100 \u03bcL, serum free), placed in the upper\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\ntranswell chamber, and incubated for 24 h at 37\u25e6C. Then, the\ncells on the upper surface of the filter were completely wiped\naway with a cotton swab, and the lower surface of the filter\nwas fixed in methanol, stained with Giemsa, and counted\nunder a microscope at a magnification of 200x. For each\nreplicate, the tumor cells in 10 randomly selected fields were\ndetermined and the counts were averaged.\n\n2.7. Determination of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by Zymography.\nMMPs in the medium released from CL1-5 cells were assayed\nusing gelatin zymography (8% zymogram gelatin gels) accor-\nding to the methods reported by Weng et al. with some modi-\nfication [6]. Briefly, the culture medium was electrophoresed\n(80 V for 120 min) in a 8% SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.1%\ngelatin. The gel was then washed at room temperature in\na solution containing 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 with two\nchanges and subsequently transferred to a reaction buffer for\nenzymatic reaction containing 1% NaN3, 10 mM CaCl2 and\n40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37\u25e6C with shaking overnight (for\n12\u221215 h). Finally, the MMP gel was stained for 30 min with\n0.25% (w/v) Coomassie blue in 10% acetic acid (v/v) and\n20% methanol (v/v) and destained in 10% acetic acid (v/v)\nand 20% methanol (v/v).\n\n2.8. Western Blotting Analysis. Whole-cell lysates proteins\n(40 \u03bcg of partially purified protein) were mixed with an equal\nvolume of electrophoresis sample buffer, and the mixture\nwas then boiled for 10 min. Then, an equal protein content\nof total cell lysate from control and EEAC-treated sample\nwere resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bed-\nford, MA, USA) by electroblotting using an electroblotting\napparatus (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding of the membranes\nwas blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contain-\ning 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and TBS-T buffer (Tris-Buffer\nSaline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for more than 2 h. Mem-\nbranes were washed with TBS-T buffer three times each for\n10 min and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of\nspecific primary antibodies in TBS-T buffer overnight at 4\u25e6C.\nThe membranes were washed with TBS-T buffer and then\nincubated with an appropriate secondary antibody (horse-\nradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-mouse, or anti-rab-\nbit IgG) for 1 h. After washing the membrane three times for\n10 min in TBS-T buffer, the bands were visualized using ECL\nreagents (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Band intensity on\nscanned films was quantified using Kodak Molecular Imag-\ning (MI) software and expressed as relative intensity com-\npared with control.\n\n2.9. Statistical Analysis. Values are expressed as means \u00b1 SD\nand analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by LSD test\nfor comparisons of group means. All statistical analyses were\nperformed using SPSS for Windows, version 10 (SPSS, Inc.);\na P value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Cytotoxicity of EEAC to CL1-5 Cells. The effect of EEAC\n(0\u2212128 \u03bcg/mL) on cell viability was determined by the MTT\n\nassay. After incubation for 24 h and 36 h, cell viability was not\nsignificantly affected by EEAC (0.125\u22121.0 \u03bcg/mL), as com-\npared to the untreated control (Figure 1(a)), indicating that\nEEAC is not toxic to CL1-5 cells at these concentrations.\nWhen cells were treated with EEAC at 1.0\u2013128 \u03bcg/mL for\n24 h and 36 h, cell viability was significantly decreased.\nEEAC (0.125\u20131.0 \u03bcg/mL) were also evaluated their apoptotic\neffect with flow cytometry, and SubG1 was not significantly\naffected by EEAC (0.125\u22121.0 \u03bcg/mL), as compared to the un-\ntreated control (Figure 1(b)). To avoid inhibition of cell via-\nbility in the following experiments, we chose to use EEAC\nconcentrations between 0.125 and 1.0 \u03bcg/mL and an incuba-\ntion time of 36 h.\n\n3.2. Effect of EEAC on Wound-Healing Assay. We further as-\nsessed the effect of EEAC on the migration of CL1-5 cells\nusing the wound healing assay in which the confluent mono-\nlayer was scraped with a sterile micropipette tip to create\na scratch wound. As shown in Figure 2(a), EEAC inhibited\nthe migration of CL1-5 cells in a dose-dependent manner,\nwith 27.7% and 40.1% inhibition at 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcg/mL after\nincubation for 36 h, respectively, (Figure 2(b)).\n\n3.3. Effect of EEAC on Migration of CL1-5 Cells In Vitro.\nThe transwell assay was used to investigate the migration\nof CL1-5 cells at 24 h after EEAC treatment. We found that\nEEAC added at 0.125\u22121.0 \u03bcg/mL significantly decreased the\nmigration (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) of CL1-5 cells and that\nthese effects of EEAC were dose dependent.\n\n3.4. EEAC Inhibits the Release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CL1-5\nCells. To examine the possible antimigration mechanisms of\nEEAC, we determined the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in\nculture media of CL1-5 cells by zymographic analysis. In the\nabsence of treatment, CL1-5 cells constitutively secreted high\nlevels of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Our results showed that EEAC\ninhibited MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities in a concentration-\ndependent manner (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). These results\nsuggest that the antimigration effect of EEAC is related to\nthe inhibition of the enzymatically degradative processes of\nCL1-5 migration.\n\n3.5. Inhibition by EEAC of MMP-2 and MMP-9. To examine\nthe possible antimigration mechanisms of EEAC, we deter-\nmined the MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions in culture media\nof CL1-5 cells by Western blotting assay. Using Western blot-\nting, we analyzed the effects of treating cells with various\nconcentration of EEAC for 36 h on MMPs protein expres-\nsion. Treatment of CL1-5 cells with EEAC induced notice-\nable reductions in MMP-9 and MMP-2 protein expression\n(Figure 5).\n\n3.6. Effect of EEAC on TIMP-1,TIMP-2, FAK, and Phosphary-\nlated FAK (p-FAK) Expressions in CL1-5 Cells. To further\nexplore the modulation of pro-MMP activation by EEAC, we\ndetermined TIMP-1/2 protein expression levels. As shown in\nFigure 5, EEAC strongly increased TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 acti-\nvity in a concentration-dependent manner.

As shown in Figure 5, EEAC suppressed\np-FAK expression in CL1-5 cells, when EEAC concentration\nwas higher than 0.25 \u03bcg/mL.\n\n3.7. Effect of EEAC on PI3K, AKT, Phosphorylated AKT\n(pAKT), and Rac-1 Expressions in CL1-5 Cells. PI3Ks are\na group of ubiquitously expressed lipid kinases which are\nimportant players in a major pathway of cell signaling. The\nPI3K/AKT pathway has been identified as a major regulator\n\nof cellular proliferation, differentiation, and death in multi-\nple cell types [18]. To further investigate the involvement of\nPI3K/AKT, a series of experiments was performed to measure\nthe expression of candidate signaling molecules upon EEAC\nstimulation. The results showed that incubation of CL1-5\ncells with EEAC (0.125\u20131.0 \u03bcg/mL) led to a dose-dependent\ndecrease of PI3K and pAKT levels (Figure 6). Similarly, EEAC\n(0\u22121.0 \u03bcg/mL,36 h) suppressed Rac-1 protein expression in\na concentration-dependent manner, and the effect became\nstatistically significant when EEAC concentration was higher\nthan 0.25 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 6).\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\n\n0 0.125 0.25 0.5 1\n\nEEAC (\u03bcg/mL)\n\n0 h\n\n36 h\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0 0.125 0.25 0.5 1\n\nEEAC (\u03bcg/mL)\n\nC\nel\n\nl m\nig\n\nra\nti\n\non\n (\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\nol\n)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: Effects of EEAC on wound healing migration of CL1-5 cells.

We analyzed the phosphorylation of MAPKs in\nCL1-5 cells after treatment with EEAC (0.125\u22121.0 \u03bcg/mL)\nfor 36 h. Data in Figure 7 showed that EEAC significantly\ndose-dependently affect p-FAK, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK1/2, or p38\nand p-p38 proteins at concentrations from 0.125\u20131.0 \u03bcg/mL.\n\n3.9. Specific Inhibitor to Analyze the Signaling Transduction.\nTo further delineate whether the inhibition of cell migration\nby EEAC occurs through inhibition of PI3K, ERK, JNK, and\np38 signaling, CL1-5 cells were 1 h pretreated with a PI3K\ninhibitor (LY294002; 50 \u03bcM), ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059;\n50 \u03bcM), JNK inhibitor (SP600125; 50 \u03bcM), p38 MAPK inhi-\nbitor (SB203580; 50 \u03bcM), and then incubated in the presence\nor absence of EEAC (1.0 \u03bcg/mL) for 36 h. The Western blot-\nting assay revealed that EEAC or LY294002 (50 \u03bcM), PD98-\n256 (50 \u03bcM), SP600125 (50 \u03bcM), SB203580 (50 \u03bcM) alone\ndecreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 protein expressions. Further-\nmore, the combined treatment (50 \u03bcM, LY294002, SB203580,\nSP600125 and PD98059 plus 1.0 \u03bcg/mL EEAC) resulted in\nenhanced inhibition of MMP-9 and MMP-2 (Figure 7(b)).\n\n4. Discussions\n\nSeveral cancer cell lines including A498, NPC-TW01, Hep3B,\nHepG2, TW206, CL1-0, and CL1-5 have been screed for their\ncell cytotoxicity at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Our results showed\nthat CL1-0 (IC50 = 16 \u03bcg/mL) and CL1-5 (IC50 = 16 \u03bcg/mL)\nexhibits more susceptible to EEAC than other cells for 36 h\nexposure. As CL1-5 cells showed higher metastatic ability, we\nexplored the antimigration effects and mechanistic actions\nof EEAC in human lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cells. Our\nresults demonstrate that EEAC significantly inhibited the\nmigration (assessed using the transwell assay and the wound-\nhealing assay) of CL1-5 cells (Figures 2 and 3). We also\nshowed that EEAC remarkably inhibited the activities of\nMMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure 4). These results demonstrated\nthat the antimetastastic effect of EEAC was associated with\n\nthe inhibition of enzymatically degradative processes of\nsmooth muscle cells migration. To our knowledge, it is the\nfirst study to demonstrate that EEAC reduces the biochemical\nmechanisms of the migration in CL1-5 cells.\n\nSeveral bioactive compound from the ethanol extract\nof A. cinnamomea, such as antroquinonol, 4-acetylantro-\nquinonol B, and zhankuic acid A, have been reported to\nreduce cell proliferation of hepatoma, colon and leukemia\ncancer cells [21\u201323]. Our previous studies demonstrated that\nthe marked compounds (i.e., adenosine, cordycepin, and\nzhankuic acid A) within EEAC were identified by HPLC and\nLC/MS/MS to be as indicator compounds for quality check\nof extraction procedure of each batch (data not shown).\nAccording to the relative concentration of external standards,\nthe content of adenosine, cordycepin and zhankuic acid A\nwere calculated to be 0.08, 0.16, and 235 mg/g EEAC, res-\npectively, (data not shown). Of these, adenosine might be\nthrough binding to adenosine A3 receptors (A3-AR) to dec-\nrease the telomeric signal, resulting in G0/G1 arrest of lym-\nphoma cell. Moreover, A3 receptor antagonist cotreated with\ncordycepin would reverse cordycepin-induced in mouse Ley-\ndig tumor cell death, which indicate the possible relationship\nbetween A3-AR and cordycepin-induced death effect [24,\n25]. Wu et al. indicated that cordycepin could induce cell\narrest at G2/M and subG1 phases followed by significant\napoptotic cell death in human OEC-M1 oral cancer cell line\n[26]. Similarly, cordycepin has also been found to cause\nG2/M arrest in human bladder and colon cancer cells\nthrough upregulation of p21WAF1 level as well as reduction of\ncyclin B1, Cdc2, and Cdc25c proteins in a p53-independent\nmanner by regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation\n[27, 28]. Furthermore, Geethangili and Tzeng reported that\nzhankuic acid A exhibited cytotoxic activity against P-388\nmurine and leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 1.8 and\n5.4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, [29].\n\nDuring cancer progression, certain tumor cells become\nmotile and attack the host tissue leading to metastasis.\nFocal adhesion kinase (FAK) can be activated in response to\nvarious stimuli and plays an important role in the cancer\n\n\n\n6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n24 h\n\n36 h\n\n0 \u03bcg/mL 0.25 \u03bcg/mL 0.5 \u03bcg/mL 1 \u03bcg/mL\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\u2217 \u2217\n\n0 0.25 0.5 1 0 0.25 0.5 1\n\nM\nig\n\nra\nti\n\non\n (\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\nol\n)\n\nM\nig\n\nra\nti\n\non\n (\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\nol\n)\n\nEEAC (\u03bcg/mL) EEAC (\u03bcg/mL)\n\n24 h\n36 h\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: Effects of EEAC on (a) transwell migration assay of CL1-5 cells.

Values (means \u00b1 SD, n = 3) differ significantly (P < 0.05).\n\ncell proliferation and metastasis [30]. Compiling evidence\nimplies that FAK regulates focal adhesion signaling by phos-\nphorylating various substrates and by acting as a scaffold\nfor protein-protein interactions, as well as the MMPs-medi-\nated matrix degradation, which consecutively regulates\ndownstream signaling cascades [31]. FAK, a cytoplasmic kin-\nase that is involved in ECM and integrin-mediated signaling\npathways, has been suggested to have an essential role in\nmetastasis through the modulation of tumor cell migration\nand invasion [32]. Majorly, integrin-mediated FAK signaling\nis phosphorylation of Tyr397. Particularly, phosphorylation of\nTyr397 forms a high-affinity binding site for Src-homology\ndomain 2 (SH2), domains of Src family kinase, therefore\npromoting Src kinase activity. As a result, a major function of\nFAK is to recruit and activatr Src at cell-extracellular matrix\nadhesion sites. Activated FAK in cancer cells relays signals\nthrough multiple downstream targets. For example, activa-\nted FAK binds the SH2 of PI3K, thereby transporting the\ncatalytic subunit of PI3K to the membrane, where it catalyzes\nthe phosphorylation of inositol lipids in lung cancer cell\nmigration [33]. The residues surrounding Tyr397 can also\nconstitute a sequence that binds to the Ras signaling pathway.\nThe downstream targets of the Ras signaling pathway include\nERK1/2 [34]. Indeed, these pathways are activated during\n\nintegrin binding to the ECM, resulting in the transduction\nof external stimuli from the ECM to the nucleus [35]. Cer-\ntain result suggests that anti-invasive effect in androgen-in-\ndependent prostate cancer by controlling MMP-9 expression\nthrough the suppression of the EGFR/JNK pathway [36].\nFAK and MAPK signaling involved in MMP-2 secretion has\nbeen shown in QG90 lung cancer cells [37]. Moreover, it was\nfound that the MMP-9 gene promoter is partially regulated\nthrough activation of the ERK1/2 pathway [38]. In recent,\np38 is implicating mediating bladder cancer invasion via\nregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at the level of mRNA stabi-\nlity [39]. Also, p38\u03b3 MAPK activates c-Jun, and the activated\nc-Jun recruits p38\u03b3 as a cofactor into MMP-9 promoter to\ninduce its trans-activation and cell invasion [40]. In this\nstudy, we found that EEAC inhibited the activation of FAK, as\nevidenced by reduced phosphorylation of FAK (Figure 7(a)).\nWe also demonstrated that treatment with EEAC inhibited\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2, phospho-p38, and JNK1/2 acti-\nvity (Figure 7(a)). The use of specific inhibitors revealed that\nPI3K, ERK, JNK, and p38 play important roles in regulating\ncell death induced by EEAC in CL1-5 cells (Figure 7(b)). In\nthis study, the Western blotting assay was used to examine\nthe effects of specific MAPK inhibitors, as the same method\nhas often been used to examine the effects of specific MAPK\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7\n\n0 0.125 0.50.25 1\n\nEEAC (\u03bcg/mL)\n\nMMP-9\n\nMMP-2\n\n92 kDa\n\n72 kDa\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0 0.125 0.25 0.5 1\n\nMMP-9\nMMP-2\n\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u2217\n\nM\nM\n\nP-\n2M\n\nM\nP-\n\n9 \n(%\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n)\n\nEEAC (\u03bcg/mL)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Effects of EEAC on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities of CL1-\n5 cells.

Therefore, it appears that FAK can promote\nCL1-5 cancer cell migration through the MAPK signaling\nand MMP-2 and MMP-9 pathway.\n\nIn addition, we showed that EEAC inhibited PI3K/AKT\nin CL1-5 cells. Thus, it seems that FAK promotes CL1-5\ncancer cell migration in concert with the activation of the\nPI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Increased phosphorylation\nof FAK and its downstream targets, Src, ERK1/2, PI3K,\nand AKT have been shown in A549 lung epithelial cells\nstimulated by fibronectin. Consistent with this observation,\ndepletion of FAK by siRNA resulted in the inhibition of Src,\nERK1/2, PI3K, and AKT activity [33]. Several studies have\nindicated that FAK/PI3K/Akt is involved in the regulation\nof MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities on different cell types\n[9, 41]. Shibata et al. [42] have shown that stimulated ovarian\ncancer cells with fibronectin activated MMP-9 secretion,\nwhile both antisense oligonucleotide to FAK and dominant-\nnegative mutation of Ras abolished this phenomenon. To\nassess whether EEAC inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK,\nAKT, and the protein level of PI3K, CL1-5 cells were treated\nwith various concentrations of EEAC (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and\n1.0 \u03bcg/mL) for 36 h. Figure 6 showed EEAC significantly\ninhibited the activation of FAK and AKT as shown by the\ndecrease in the phosphorylation of FAK and AKT. In ad-\ndition, EEAC inhibited the protein levels of PI3K in a dose-\ndependent manner (Figure 6). Zeng et al. [43] reported that\nactivated FAK-induced PI3K is required for the production\nof matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Also, PI3K is one of\nthe critical downstream signal molecules of FAK pathways\n[44]. Therefore, our results demonstrated that EEAC inhib-\nited the expressions of p-FAK, pAKT, and PI3K.\n\nThe Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases\n(GTPases) (including RhoA, RhoB, c-Raf, Rac-1, and Cdc42)\nare critical in regulating actin reorganization associated with\ncell growth, migration, transformation, and gene expression\n\n\n\n8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n0 0.125 0.50.25 1\n\n1 0.9 0.7 0.7 0.6\n\n1 1 1 0.6 0.5\n\n11 0.9 1 1\n\n11 0.9 1 1\n\nJNK1\nJNK2\n\np-JNK1\np-JNK2\n\np38\n\np-p38\n\n\u03b2-actin\n\n54 kDa\n\n49 kDa\n\n49 kDa\n55 kDa\n\n42 kDa\n\n42 kDa\n\n42 kDa\n\nEEAC (\u03bcg/mL) EEAC (\u03bcg/mL)\n\n0 0.125 0.50.25 1\n\n1 0.9 0.8 0.6 0.5\n\n1 0.8 0.9 0.9 1\n\n1 1 0.9 0.3 0.3\n\n11 1 0.9 1\n\n125 kDa\n\n125 kDa\n\n44 kDa\n42 kDa\n\n44 kDa\n42 kDa\n\n42 kDa\n\nFAK\n\np-FAK\n\nERK1\nERK2\n\np-ERK1\np-ERK2\n\n\u03b2-actin\n\n(a)\n\n1 0.9 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.2\n\n1 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.7 0.6\n\nC\non\n\ntr\nol\n\nD\nM\n\nSO\n\nE\nE\n\nA\nC\n\n (\n1\u03bc\n\ng/\nm\n\nL)\n\nLY\n 2\n\n94\n00\n\n2 \n(5\n\n0 \n\u03bc\n\nM\n)\n\nE\nE\n\nA\nC\n\n +\n L\n\nY\n29\n\n40\n02\n\nSP\n60\n\n01\n25\n\n (\n50\n\u03bc\n\nM\n)\n\nE\nE\n\nA\nC\n\n +\n S\n\nP\n60\n\n01\n25\n\n \n\nE\nE\n\nA\nC\n\n +\n S\n\nB\n20\n\n35\n80\n\nP\nD\n\n98\n05\n\n9 \n(5\n\n0 \n\u03bc\n\nM\n)\n\nE\nE\n\nA\nC\n\n +\n P\n\nD\n98\n\n05\n9\n\nSB\n20\n\n35\n80\n\n (\n50\n\u03bc\n\nM\n)\n\n92 kDa\n\n72 kDa\n\n42 kDa\n\nMMP-9\n\nMMP-2\n\n\u03b2-actin\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: Effects of EEAC on protein levels of MAPK signaling and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) in CL1-5 cells.

(b) Effects of PI3K inhibitor (LY294002;\n50 \u03bcM), ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059; 50 \u03bcM), JNK inhibitor (SP600125; 50 \u03bcM), and p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580; 50 \u03bcM) on EEAC-\ninduced protein expressions of MMP-2 and -9. Cells were pretreated with an inhibitor (50 \u03bcM) at 1 h prior to the treatment with 1.0 \u03bcg/mL\nEEAC for 36 h (total inhibitor exposure time was 37 h). Protein expressions of MMP-2 and -9 were determined by the western blotting assay.\n\n[45]. The Rho family of GTPases has been reported to be\ninvolved in the regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kin-\nase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway [46]. In addition, Camp-\nbell et al. [9] reported that PI3K/AKT signal transduction\npathway regulates cell invasion and metastasis of nonsmall\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is closely associated with the\ndevelopment and progression of various tumors. Rac1 was\nreported to act as a downstream effect of PI3-K in several\ngrowth factor-stimulated pathways [47] and to induce inva-\nsion and metastasis in cancer cells [48]. Rac1 activation also\nplayed a critical role in the migration of cancer cells [49].\nRac-1 has been implicated in the regulation of the contrac-\ntion and retraction forces that are required for cell migra-\ntion [50]. Increased Rac-1 expression enhances the phos-\nphorylation of myosin, which cross-links actin filaments and\ngenerates contractile forces, promoting movement of the cell\nbody and facilitating cell rear detachment. Rac-1 is also im-\nplicated in the invasion of human microvascular endothelial\ncells. Active-Rac-1 could induce the expression of MMP-9\n\nmetalloproteinase and promote migration of endothelial\ncells [51]. Rac-1 may exert this activity through upregulate\ntranscription factors such as NF-\u03baB known to be involved\nin the expression of certain metalloproteinases including\nMMP-9. Our finding that EEAC concentration dependen-\ntly decreased Rac-1 protein expression (Figure 6), suggest-\ning that EEAC may also inhibit the metastasis of CL1-5\ncells through the PI3K/Akt\u2014Rac-1 and Rac-1\u2014MMP-9\npathways.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that EEAC inhibits\nthe migration of human lung adenocarcinoma cancer CL1-5\ncells. Mechanistically, we show that this effect of EEAC may\noccur through inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway,\nexerting inhibitory effects on FAK, p-FAK, and Rac-1 protein\nexpressions and inhibiting PI3K, and phospho-Akt levels,\nthereby decreasing the activities of MMP-2, MMP-9 of CL1-\n5 cells (Figure 8). Further preclinical and clinical studies are\nrequired to demonstrate the potential of EEAC as an anti-\ncancer agent.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nECM \n\nCytosol \n\nEEAC\n\np-FAK\n\nPI3K\n\np-ERK p-p38 p-JNK AKT\n\nRac-1\n\nMMP-2,\nMMP-9\n\nMigration\n\nFigure 8: Proposed signaling pathways for EEAC-mediated inhibi-\ntion against migration of CL1-5 cells.

Here we describe the identification\nof Rab1 as a conserved regulator of AA signaling to mTORC1. AA stimulates Rab1A GTP binding and\ninteraction with mTORC1 and Rheb-mTORC1 interaction in the Golgi. Rab1A overexpression promotes\nmTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth in an AA- and mTORC1-dependent manner. Conversely, Rab1A\nknockdown selectively attenuates oncogenic growth of Rab1-overexpressing cancer cells. Moreover,\nRab1A is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is correlated with elevated mTORC1 signaling,\ntumor invasion, progression, and poor prognosis. Our results demonstrate that Rab1 is anmTORC1 activator\nand an oncogene and that hyperactive AA signaling through Rab1A overexpression drives oncogenesis\nand renders cancer cells prone to mTORC1-targeted therapy.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCell growth is a process of assimilating extracellular nutrients\n\ninto the cell mass, which requires the coordinated regulation of\n\nnutrient transport and protein synthetic capability. Signaling\n\nmodules have evolved to transduce nutrient cues to cellular pro-\n\ngrams such as transcription and translation (Dechant and Peter,\n\n2008; Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004; Zaman et al., 2008). mTOR is a\n\nconserved central growth controller in eukaryotes (Loewith and\n\nHall, 2011; Sengupta et al., 2010). It forms two distinct kinase\n\ncomplexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Loewith et al., 2002;\n\nSarbassov et al., 2004). In response to nutrient signals, mTORC1\nSignificance\n\nAA is an essential nutrient and key chemical signal for cell gro\nGTPase previously known for vesicular trafficking, has a cruc\nmTORC1 by AA and elucidates a Golgi-based mechanism by\nfurther demonstrates that aberrant hyperactivation of AA sig\ndriving oncogenic transformation and malignant growth.

Because mTORC1 is\n\ncommonly hyperactivated in human tumors, it is a desirable\n\ntarget for cancer therapy (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004; Zhang\n\net al., 2011). Two rapamycin analogs (rapalogs), everolimus\n\nand temsirolimus, are Food and Drug Administration-approved\n\ndrugs for advanced renal and breast carcinomas. However,\n\nthe overall objective response rate remains low for rapalogs.\n\nTherefore, studying the regulation of mTORC1 is of considerable\n\nbiological and clinical importance.\nwth and metabolism. This study shows that Rab1A, a small\nial role in the Rag- and lysosome-independent activation of\nwhich Rab1A engages mTORC1 interaction with Rheb.

Rag proteins are lysosomal/vacu-\n\nolar membrane-bound small GTPases. Upon AA stimulation,\n\nRag GTPases function as heterodimers that bind to and activate\n\nTORC1 (Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). In the presence of\n\nleucine, leucyl tRNA synthetase binds to Rags and promotes\n\nTORC1 signaling (Han et al., 2012). Rag is well conserved from\n\nyeast to humans (Sekiguchi et al., 2001). The yeast Rag homo-\n\nlogs Gtr1 and Gtr2 have been shown recently to also mediate\n\nAA signaling to TORC1 (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012).\n\nBecause the importance of AA in cell growth and metabolism,\n\nhowever, Rag proteins are probably not the only sensors. The\n\ngoal of this study is to identify the Rag-independent regulator\n\nof AA signaling and investigate the underlying mechanism and\n\nsignificance.\n\nRESULTS\n\nYpt1 Is Essential for AA to Activate TORC1 in Yeast\nGtr1 and Gtr2, the yeast orthologs of RagA/RagB and RagC/\n\nRagD, respectively, function as a heterodimer to regulate\n\nTORC1 (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012). Consistently,\n\ngtr1D and gtr2D mutants are hypersensitive to rapamycin (Fig-\n\nure 1A), indicative of their role in TORC1 signaling (Bertram\n\net al., 1998). However, thesemutants exhibit no apparent growth\n\ndefect, and AA can still fully activate TORC1 in gtr1D and gtr2D\n\nmutants, as judged by phosphorylation of the TORC1 substrates\n\nSch9 and Maf1 (Figure 1B) (Wei and Zheng, 2009; Wei and\n\nZheng, 2010). Additionally, the dominant-active Gtr1-guanosine\n\ntriphosphate (GTP) and Gtr2-guanosine diphosphate (GDP) do\n\nnot affect TORC1 activity during AA starvation and restimulation\n\n(Figure 1C). The yeast vacuole (lysosome) anchors Gtr1 and\n\nGtr2 signaling (Binda et al., 2009; Bonfils et al., 2012), but the\n\ngrowth and TORC1 signaling remain normal in vacuolar biogen-\n\nesis mutants vps16D, vps33D, pep3D, and pep5D (Figures 1A\n\nand 1D). Together, these observations clearly show that GTR\n\nand the vacuole are dispensable for AA signaling to TORC1 in\n\nyeast.\n\nWe showed previously that genes in the TORC1 pathway\n\ndisplay the rapamycin-sensitive phenotype (Bertram et al.,\n\n1998). Using this assay, we carried out a genomic screen and\n\nidentified a large set of TORC1 signaling genes (Chan et al.,\n\n2000). Because most known mTORC1 activators are small\n\nGTPases (e.g., Rheb, Rag, and Rho1) (Inoki et al., 2003; Kim\n\net al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008; Stocker et al., 2003; Tee et al.,\n\n2003; Yan et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2003), we focused our search\n\nfor the Rag-independent TORC1 activator on small GTPases,\n\nparticularly Rab, one of the largest small GTPase subfamilies\n\n(Hutagalung and Novick, 2011; Stenmark, 2009). Among the\n\nnine nonessential yeast Rab mutants, ypt6D and ypt7D are\n\nhypersensitive to rapamycin (Figure 1E). With the two essential\n\nRab genes, when assayed under Tet-off conditions (Hughes\n\net al., 2000), the Tet-YPT1 strain, but not the Tet-SEC4 strain,\n\nshowed a rapamycin-hypersensitive phenotype (Figure 1F). The\n\nypt1-ts mutant also displayed rapamycin hypersensitivity (Fig-\n\nure 1G). Therefore, Ypt1, Ypt6, and Ypt7 are involved in TORC1\n\nsignaling. However, depletion of YPT1 (Figure 1H), but not YPT6\n\nand YPT7, blocks the activation of TORC1 by AA (Figures 1H\n\nand 1I), indicating that Ypt1 is essential for AA signaling. The pre-\nCan\ncise role of Ypt6 and Ypt7 in TORC1 signaling is presently\n\nunknown.\n\nYpt1 is the yeast paralog of Rab1, a highly conserved Golgi\n\nmembrane-bound GTPase previously known for ER-to-Golgi\n\nvesicular trafficking (Hutagalung and Novick, 2011; Stenmark,\n\n2009). However, a large number of yeast mutants in ER-Golgi\n\ntrafficking do not display a rapamycin-sensitive phenotype\n\n(Figure S1A available online), suggesting that the role of\n\nRab1 in TORC1 signaling is not directly related to its trafficking\n\nfunction. Consistently, Ypt1 interacts with Tor1, which is a\n\nTORC1-specific component in yeast, in a GTP- and AA-\n\ndependent manner (Figure S1B), and AA stimulates GTP-bind-\n\ning by Ypt1 (Figures S1C and S1D). These results indicate that\n\nAA regulates Ypt1 and its GTP-dependent interaction with\n\nTORC1.\n\nAA Stimulates Rab1A Interaction with mTORC1 in a\nGTP- and Golgi-Dependent Manner in HEK293E cells\nA recent RNAi screen revealed that dRAB1 knockdown in\n\nDrosophila S2 cells strongly inhibits dS6K phosphorylation\n\n(Li et al., 2010), suggesting that the Rab1 function in TORC1\n\nsignaling is conserved. To further explore this, we knocked\n\ndown Rab1A in human embryonic kidney 293E (HEK293E)\n\ncells with three distinct Rab1A small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs),\n\nall of which efficiently downregulate Rab1A expression and\n\ninhibit the phosphorylation of S6K1(T389) but not AKT(S473),\n\nindicating that Rab1A is specifically required for mTORC1\n\nsignaling (Figure 2A). Rab1A knockdown attenuates the\n\nactivation of mTORC1 by AA (Figure 2B). In contrast, mTORC1\n\ncan still be stimulated by insulin after Rab1A knockdown\n\n(albeit the overall mTORC1 signaling level is decreased) (Figure\n\n2C). The latter phenomenon is similar to that of Rag knock-\n\ndown (Kim et al., 2008).Therefore, Rab1A function in AA\n\nsignaling is conserved in humans. Of note, Rab1A knockdown\n\ndoes not cause cell death, as judged by lack of PARP cleav-\n\nage (Figure 2A), which is consistent with the mTORC1-specific\n\nfunction for Rab1A.\n\nAs in yeast, endogenous Rab1A also interacts with mTORC1\n\n(Figure 2D). Hemagglutinin (HA)-Rab1A is associated with\n\nmTOR and Raptor, not Rictor (Figure S2A), and is bound more\n\nwith Myc-Raptor than Myc-mTOR (Figures S2B and S2C). Myc-\n\nRaptor, not Myc-mTOR, remained associated with HA-Rab1A\n\nafter the immunocomplex was washed with 0.5% TX-100, a con-\n\ndition known to disrupt mTORC1 (Figure S2D), indicating that\n\nRaptor mediates the binding of Rab1A. Rab1A is a small GTP-\n\nbinding protein anchored on ER and Golgi membranes through\n\nprenylation (Calero et al., 2003; Gomes et al., 2003). mTOR\n\npreferentially binds to Rab1A-GTP (Rab1A-Q70L, Rab1AGTP)\n\n(Pind et al., 1994) compared with Rab1A-GDP (Rab1A-S25N,\n\nRab1AGDP) (Alvarez et al., 2003) or a Rab1AC202, 203S mutant\n\n(Rab1AC2S) deficient of prenylation and ER/Golgi localization\n\n(Calero et al., 2003; Gomes et al., 2003) (Figure 2E).\n\nUpon AA stimulation, there is a significant increase in the GTP-\n\nbinding activity of Rab1A (Figures 2F and 2G). Moreover, AA reg-\n\nulates the Rab1A interaction with mTORC1 in a GTP-dependent\n\nmanner (Figure 2H). Strikingly, Rab1AGTP binds persistently to\n\nmTORC1 and sustains mTORC1 signaling even during AA star-\n\nvation (Figures 2H and 2I). In contrast, serum and insulin do not\n\naffect Rab1A GTP-binding (Figure 2J) or the Rab1A-mTORC1\ncer Cell 26, 754\u2013769, November 10, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. 755\n\n\n\nA B\n\nE\n\nD\n\nWT\n\nypt10\u2206\n\nypt11\u2206\n\ntor1\u2206\n\nypt52\u2206\n\nypt53\u2206\n\nWT\n\ntet-YPT1\n\ntet-SEC4\n\nypt31\u2206\n\nypt32\u2206\n\nypt6\u2206\n\nypt7\u2206\n\nF\n\nypt51\u2206\n\nWT\n\nypt1-ts\n\nG\n\nWT\n\ntet-YPT1\n\ntet-SEC4\n\n      Rap       Rap\n\n      Rap       Rap\n\n       Rap\n\n       Rap\n\n      Rap\n\nRap      Dox Dox\n\nWT Tet -YPT1\n\nDox\nAA \n\nHA-Sch9\n\nMaf1-Myc\n\nH I\nWT ypt6\u2206 ypt7\u2206 \n\n   AA \n\nMaf1-Myc\n\nHA-Sch9\nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nWT pep3\u2206 pep5\u2206 vps16\u2206 vps33\u2206 \n\nHA-\nSch9\n\nMaf1-\nMyc\n\n   AA \nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nWT gtr1\u2206 gtr2\u2206 \n\nHA-Sch9\n\nMaf1-Myc\n\n  AA \nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\n  Maf1\n\nWT\n\npep5\u2206 \n\npep3\u2206 \n\nvps16\u2206\n\ngtr1\u2206 \n\nvps33\u2206 \n\ngtr2\u2206 \n\n      Rap       Rap\n\nC\n\nP-Sch9\n  Sch9\n\nP-Maf1\nMaf1-Myc\n\nWT\n\nSch9-HA\n\n AA \n\nGTR2GDPGTR1GTP\n\nFigure 1.

Curiously, AA starvation disrupts the association of\n\nYpt1GTP with TORC1 in yeast but not Rab1AGTP with mTORC1\n\nin humans. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients such as\n\nAA play a more prominent growth regulatory role in single-celled\n\norganisms than in mammals. The latter is regulated by nutrients\n\nas well as polypeptide factors (e.g., cytokines and hormones).\n\nConsistent with this notion, starvation of HEK293E cells of both\n\nserum and AA also blocks the binding of Rab1AGTP to mTORC1\n\n(data not shown).\nCancer Cell 26, 754\u2013769, N\nRab1A Regulates the Formation\nof the Rheb-mTORC1 Complex\nin the Golgi\nWhen ectopically expressed, Rab1A\n\nstimulates the level of P-S6K1 and\nP-4EBP1 but not P-AKT (Figures S3A and S3B), indicating\n\nthat Rab1A overexpression specifically promotes mTORC1\n\nsignaling.

Curiously, the dominant-active\n\nRagBGTP/RagCGDP can partially rescue the loss of Rab1A\n\n(Figure S3C). These observations indicate that the regulation\n\nof mTORC1 by Rab1A is dependent on Rheb but that Rab1A\n\nand Rag are relatively independent of each other, with Rab1A\n\nhaving a more prominent role, which is consistent with the\n\nyeast results.\n\nAlthough Rag GTPases regulate mTORC1 in lysosomes\n\n(Sancak et al., 2010), mTORC1 is widely distributed throughout\n\nthe cell, including the ER, the Golgi, endosomes, mitochondria,\n\nand the nucleus (Drenan et al., 2004; Li et al., 2006; Liu and\n\nZheng, 2007; Sancak et al., 2008; Schieke et al., 2006), sug-\n\ngesting that the regulation of mTORC1 signaling is more\n\ncomplex than currently thought, involving multiple subcellular\n\nsystems and mechanisms. To locate where Rab1A engages\n\nmTORC1, we used Duolink, which allows the detection of\n\nprotein-protein interactions in situ in intact cells and tissues\n\n(So\u0308derberg et al., 2006), to analyze in situ Rab1A-mTORC1\n\ninteraction. Antibodies against Rab1A and Raptor or mTOR\n\ntogether, but not each individually or under the condition that\n\none partner is knocked down, generated a strong signal in\n\nthe Golgi (Figure 3C; Figures S3D\u2013S3H). Therefore, Rab1A in-\n\nteracts with mTORC1 specifically in the Golgi, which is consis-\n\ntent with our earlier observation that Golgi localization is\n\nrequired for Rab1A to bind to and activate mTORC1 (Figure 2E;\n\nFigure S3A).\n\nTo further investigate the mechanism of mTORC1 regulation\n\nby Rab1A, we examined the localization of the Rheb-mTORC1\n\ncomplex. Rheb-Raptor interaction prominently occurs in the\n\nGolgi, as judged by conventional and confocal microscopy\n\n(Figures 3D and 3E; Figure S3D). This result is consistent\n\nwith the observation that both Rheb and mTORC1 are promi-\n\nnently localized in this organelle (Figure S3I) (Buerger et al.,\n\n2006; Drenan et al., 2004; Hanker et al., 2010; Liu and Zheng,\n\n2007). In addition, Rheb interaction with mTORC1 has been\n\nmainly detected in the Golgi in live cells (Yadav et al., 2013).\n\nRaptor-Rheb15 is a fusion protein of Raptor and the C-terminal\n\nRheb CAAX signal sequence. When expressed in cells, it\n\ncauses constitutive activation of mTORC1 (Sancak et al.,\n\n2010). Because Rheb15 contains the CAAX motif that is suffi-\n\ncient to target Rheb to the Golgi (Buerger et al., 2006; Hanker\n\net al., 2010), we investigated Raptor-Rheb15 subcellular local-\n\nization and found that it is indeed predominantly found in the\n\nGolgi (Figures S3J and S3K). Moreover, Rab1A knockdown\n\ndisrupts mTORC1 localization or Rheb-mTORC1 interaction\n\nin the Golgi (Figures 3F and 3G; Figure S3L) while not affecting\n\nmTORC1 localization or interaction with Rag in the lysosomes\n\n(Figures S3M-S3Q). Therefore, Rab1A controls mTORC1\n\nsignaling by regulating the formation of the Golgi Rheb-\n\nmTORC1 complex.\n(F) HEK293E cells were transfected with a Rab1A small interfering RNA (siRNA) or\n\nbar, 10 mm.\n\n(G) HEK293E cells transiently expressing GM130-GFP (green) were analyzed for\n\nsiRNA.

To ask whether Rab1A is also aberrantly\n\nexpressed in other malignancies, we performed immunohisto-\n\nchemistry (IHC) staining of Rab1A in primary human colorectal\n\ncancer (CRC) and adjacent normal tissues. Rab1A staining is\n\nmuch stronger (median H score, 255) in tumors than the match-\n\ning normal tissues (median H score, 40) (Figures 4A and 4B).\n\nRab1A is scored higher in approximately 80% tumors, although\n\nthe intensity is markedly variable, with IHC scores 100-fold\n\nhigher in tumors than in normal tissues (Figure 4C).\n\nWe next examined the relationship between Rab1A expres-\n\nsion and mTORC1 signaling by staining Rab1A and P-S6K1 in\n\nconsecutive tissue sections. Overall, Rab1A expression is\n\nstrongly correlated with P-S6K1 staining (Figures 4D and 4E).\n\nIn tumors with heterogeneous Rab1A expression, the P-S6K1\n\nlevel still showed a striking correlation with the Rab1A level. In\n\ntumor nodules with high Rab1A expression, P-S6K1 staining is\n\nalso stronger (Figure 4F). We further examined the relationship\n\nbetween Rab1A staining and different clinicopathologic param-\n\neters and found that high Rab1A-positive staining is statistically\n\nsignificantly correlated with poor survival (Figure 4G), increased\n\ntumor invasion, and advanced tumor stages (Table S1). In\n\naddition, high Rab1A-positive staining appears to be associated\n\nwith lymph node metastasis, but the result is not statistically\n\nsignificant because of limited sample size (Table S1). Together,\n\nthese results show that Rab1A is frequently overexpressed in\n\nCRC and that high Rab1A expression is correlated with hyper-\n\nactive mTORC1 signaling, tumor invasion and progression, and\n\npoor prognosis.\n\nRab1A Is Essential for the Oncogenic Growth of\nRab1A-Overexpressing CRC Cells\nIn a panel of CRC cell lines, Rab1A expression is also highly\n\nvariable, ranging from high (e.g., DLD-1 and CACO2) to low\n\n(e.g., RKO and COLO205) but is correlated with P-S6K1, not\n\nP-AKT (Figure 5A; Figures S4A and S4B). Therefore, these cell\n\nlines have similar characteristics as primary tumors and are\n\ngood models for studying the significance of Rab1A expression.\n\nSurprisingly, P-S6K1 is not correlated with the expression of\n\nRab1B, Rheb, RagA, RagB, RagC, and RagD (Figures S4C\u2013\n\nS4H), suggesting that, unlike Rab1A, other known mTORC1 ac-\n\ntivators are not responsible for hyperactive mTORC1 signaling\n\nin CRC cells. When Rab1A is knocked down in three pairs of\n\nCRC cell lines (DLD-1 and CACO2, KM12 and HCT116, and\n\nRKO and COLO205, representative of high, moderate and low\n\nRab1A expression in cells, respectively), mTORC1 signaling is\n\nabrogated (Figure 5B).

Of note, Rab1A knockdown did not affect cell viability\n\nbecause no significant increase in apoptotic cell death was\n\nseen (data not shown), which is consistent with the results\n\nwith HEK293E cells (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Rab1A knock-\n\ndown attenuates mTORC1 signaling (P-S6K1 staining) and\n\noncogenic growth (Ki67 staining and mitotic index) of DLD-1\n\nxenograft tumors in nude mice (Figures 5I\u20135K). The fact that\n\nRab1A knockdown preferentially inhibits CRC cells with high\n\nRab1A suggests that Rab1A overexpression is a key driver for\n\ncancer growth.\n\nRab1A Overexpression Rather Than Activated PI3K\nor MEK Is Essential for Hyperactive mTORC1 Signaling\nand Oncogenic Growth of CRC Cells\nPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is thought to be a major\n\nupstream regulator of mTOR signaling. DLD1, HCT116, and\n\nRKO each carry a heterozygote-activating mutant PIK3CA allele.\n\nThe P-S6K1 level is very low in RKO (Figure 5A), indicating that\n\nactivated PI3K is insufficient to promote mTORC1 signaling in\n\nRKO cells. However, P-S6K is moderate or high in DLD1 and\n\nHCT116 (Figure 5A), presenting an interesting dilemma. Is\n\nRab1A or PI3K responsible for elevated mTORC1 signaling and\n\noncogenic growth? To address this question, we analyzed the\n\nisogenic DLD1 and HCT116 cell lines in which the PIK3CAWT\n\nor PIK3CAmutant allele is deleted (Samuels et al., 2005). Deletion\n\nof thePIK3CAmutant allele abolishes AKT but not S6K1 phosphor-\n\nylation (Figures 6A; Figure S5A), which is in contrast to Rab1A\n\nknockdown, which abolishes mTORC1 signaling (Figure 6A).\n\nMoreover, Rab1A knockdown, rather than PIK3CAmutant dele-\n\ntion, attenuates CRC cell growth and colony formation (Figures\n\n6B\u20136E). This result is consistent with a previous report showing\n\nthat the activated PI3K mutant is responsible for enhanced\n\nsurvival but not growth of CRC cells (Samuels et al., 2005). The\n\nRas/MEK/ERK pathway is another major mitogenic signaling\n\npathway that is frequently mutated in CRC. However, MEK\n\ninhibition had little effect on mTORC1 signaling, cell growth, or\n\ncolony formation of DLD1 and CACO2 cells that both have\n\nRab1A overexpression and high ERK signaling (Figures S5B\u2013\n\nS5D). These data show that Rab1A-AA signaling, rather than\n\nPI3K and the MEK pathway, is crucial for hyperactive mTORC1\n\nsignaling and growth of DLD1, HCT116, and CACO2 cells.\n\nCRC Cells with Rab1A Overexpression Are Addictive\nto AA for Growth\nBecause Rab1A mediates AA signaling to activate mTORC1,\n\nwe investigated how AA modulates CRC oncogenic growth\n(C) Scatter plot showing the Rab1A staining level in individual tumors as a ratio o\n\n(D) Consecutive CRC tissue sections were stained for Rab1A and P-S6K1.

There is a\n\nstriking inverse relationship between Rab1A expression and\n\ncell growth during AA restriction. DLD1 and CACO2 cells\n\n(high Rab1A expression) are much more sensitive to AA restric-\n\ntion than RKO and COLO205 (low Rab1A expression), whereas\n\nHCT116 and KM12 (modest Rab1A expression) are inter-\n\nmediate (Figure 6F). For example, the growth of DLD1 and\n\nCACO2 cells is reduced by nearly 50% in culture medium\n\nsupplied with 75% AA (Figure 6F). In contrast, that of RKO\n\nand COLO205 remains normal. On the other hand, no sig-\n\nnificant correlation is seen between Rab1A expression and\n\nthe sensitivity to serum or glucose starvation (Figures 6G\n\nand 6H; Figure S5E). These observations suggest that CRC\n\ncells with Rab1A overexpression are highly addictive to AA\n\nfor growth.\n\nRab1A Overexpression Promotes Oncogenic\nTransformation and Malignant Growth\nTo evaluate the pathological consequence of Rab1A overex-\n\npression, we ectopically expressed GFP or GFP-Rab1A in NIH\n\n3T3 cells. As observed in HEK293E cells, GFP-Rab1A stimulates\n\nS6K1 phosphorylation compared with GFP (Figure 7A) and the\n\ngrowth and colony formation of NIH 3T3 cells (Figures 7B and\n\n7C; Figure S6A). These cells also form large foci in confluent cul-\n\nture and exhibit anchorage-independent growth (Figures 7D and\n\n7E; Figure S6B). In contrast, the H-RasV12 mutant does not sig-\n\nnificantly affect mTORC1 signaling or promote oncogenic\n\ngrowth (Figures 7A\u20137E; Figures S6A and S6B). Of note, cells\n\nwith GFP-Rab1A display similar oncogenic growth in the\n\nabsence or presence of H-RasV12, indicating that Rab1A does\n\nnot cooperate with H-RasV12 in oncogenic transformation.\n\nCompared with WT Rab1A, Rab1A-GTP further promotes,\n\nwhereas Rab1A-GDP and Rab1A-C2S reduce, cell growth (Fig-\n\nure S6C), which is consistent with their mTORC1-activating\n\nactivity.\n\nWe further evaluated the oncogenic potential of Rab1A in vivo\n\nby injecting nude mice with NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing\n\nGFP-Rab1A or GFP. Control cells have a low propensity to\n\nform tiny tumors in nude mice (6 out of 12) (Figures 7F and\n\n7G), which is consistent with previously studies (Greig et al.,\n\n1985; Rong et al., 1994). In contrast, GFP-Rab1A cells form large\n\ntumors with 100% efficiency (12 out of 12) (Figures 7F and 7G).\n\nHistologically, GFP-Rab1A tumors display elevated S6K1 phos-\n\nphorylation and malignant phenotypes (e.g., high cell density,\n\nmitotic index, and nuclear variability) (Figure 7H). These results\n\nindicate that Rab1A overexpression is sufficient to transform\n\nimmortalized cells.\nf Rab1A staining in CRC versus paired non-cancerous tissue.\n\nare representative cases with high, moderate, or negative Rab1A staining and\n\nwas evaluated by a nonparametric Spearman test.

GFP-\n\nRab1A overexpression enhances S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig-\n\nure 7I) and promotes RKO cell growth and colony formation\n\n(Figures 7J and 7K) and xenograft tumor growth in nude mice\n\n(Figures 7L and 7M). RKO tumors expressing GFP-Rab1A\n\nshow elevated P-S6K1 and an elevatedmitotic index (Figure 7N).\n\nTherefore, Rab1A overexpression can also enhance the malig-\n\nnant growth of established tumors. To determine the depen-\n\ndence of Rab1A-mediated transformation on Rheb and Rag\n\nGTPases, we knocked down Rheb or RagA/RagB in RKO cells\n\noverexpressing GFP-Rab1A. Downregulation of Rheb and\n\nRaptor much more significantly attenuates Rab1A-stimulated\n\nmTORC1 signaling, cell growth, and colony formation than\n\nknockdown of RagA and RagB (Figures S6D\u2013S6F). Therefore,\n\nRab1A is primarily dependent on Rheb for stimulation of\n\nmTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth.\n\nRab1A Overexpression Promotes mTORC1-Dependent\nOncogenic Growth and Determines Rapamycin\nSensitivity in CRC\nSuccessful targeted cancer therapy hinges on hyperactivation\n\nof the target signaling pathway (Shawver et al., 2002). Cancer\n\ncells become dependent on, or \u2018\u2018addicted to\u2019\u2019 such \u2018\u2018growth\n\ndriver\u2019\u2019 pathway, rendering these cells prone to the targeted\n\ntreatment. We therefore investigated the relationship between\n\nRab1A overexpression and rapamycin sensitivity. Indeed,\n\nthere is a strong correlation between Rab1A expression and\n\ngrowth inhibition in the panel of CRC cell lines, with the highest\n\nrapamycin sensitivity for DLD1 and CACO2 and the lowest for\n\nRKO and COLO205 (Figure 8A). To verify this finding in vivo,\n\nwe generated DLD1 and RKO xenograft tumors, representing\n\nCRC with high and low Rab1A expression, respectively. After\n\ntumors were established, the animals were treated with rapa-\n\nmycin or a control vehicle. Rapamycin completely blocks the\n\ngrowth of DLD1 tumors but has no discernible effect on RKO\n\ntumors (Figure 8B), despite strong on-target inhibition of\n\nmTORC1 signaling by rapamycin (Figure 8C). Moreover, rapa-\n\nmycin abrogates the elevated mTORC1 signaling, growth,\n\nand colony formation of NIH 3T3 and RKO cells driven by\n\nRab1A overexpression (Figures 8D and 8E), indicating that\n\nthe oncogenic growth by Rab1A overexpression is indeed\n\nmediated by mTORC1. Together, these results demonstrate\n\nthat Rab1A overexpression drives mTORC1-dependent onco-\n\ngenic growth and determines drug sensitivity to mTORC1-\n\ntargeted therapy in CRC.\nFigure 5.

Here we describe a Rab1\n\nfunction that mediates AA signaling to activate mTORC1.\n\nDownregulation of Rab1 inhibits mTORC1 activation by AA in\n\nyeast and humans, indicating that this Rab1 function is well\n\nconserved. Mechanistically, AA stimulates Rab1A GTP binding\n\nand the GTP-dependent interaction with mTORC1 in the Golgi.\n\nRab1 does not directly activate mTORC1 kinase activity (data\n\nnot shown). Instead, it regulates Rheb interaction with mTORC1\n\nin the Golgi. Together, these observations show that Rab1 uses\n\nthe Golgi as an anchor to regulate mTORC1 activation by Rheb\n\nin response to AA sufficiency.\n\nRab1A and Rag both interact with mTORC1 in response to AA\n\nsufficiency and promote the colocalization of mTORC1 with\n\nRheb. However, they are anchored on two distinct endomem-\n\nbrane systems, with Rag on the lysosomes and Rab1A on the\n\nGolgi. Rab1A knockdown blocks Rheb-mTORC1 interaction on\n\nthe Golgi but not the lysosomes (Figure 8F). Rab1A overexpres-\n\nsion rescues the ability of AA to activate mTORC1 in the absence\n\nof RagA/RagB, whereas overexpression of the hyperactive\n\nRagBGTP/RagCGDP complex partially restores AA activation of\n\nmTORC1 when Rab1A is knocked down. In addition, Rab1A\n\nrequires Rheb, but not Rag, to stimulate mTORC1 signaling\n\nand oncogenic growth in CRC cells. These observations suggest\n\nthat Rab1A and Rag operate as two independent axes of AA\n\nsignaling to mTORC1. Interestingly, constitutively activated\n\nRag GTPases in humans, but not in yeast, partially rescue\n\nmTORC1 activation by AA in the absence of Rab1A, suggesting\n\nthat Rag gains a bigger role in AA signaling during evolution.\n\nBecause AAs are essential for cell growth and metabolism, it\n\nmakes sense for eukaryotic cells to add redundant signaling\n\nmodules, Rab1 and Rag, to transduce AA signals, which ensures\n\nthe reliable transmission of this crucial mitogenic signal. In addi-\n\ntion, it is possible that the two signaling branches have distinct\n\nfunctions to provide finer control of the signaling process (e.g.,\n\nengaging in external versus internal AA signals or a different\n\ntype of AA).\n\nSmall GTPases such as Ras, Rho, Rac, and Ral are known for\n\ntheir roles in cancer initiation and development. Rab proteins\n\nconstitute one of the largest subfamilies of small GTPases\n\nand are generally regarded as housekeeping proteins involved\n\nin intracellular membrane dynamics.

Interestingly, Rab1A has been re-\n\nported previously to be highly overexpressed in human tongue\n\nsquamous cell carcinomas (Shimada et al., 2005). Here we\n\nreport that Rab1A is overexpressed in CRC. In addition, Rab1A\n\nis overexpressed in breast and liver tumors (unpublished data).\n\nThese results indicate that aberrant Rab1A expression is a gen-\n\neral phenomenon in human malignancies. Although PI3K acts\n\nupstream of mTORC1, surprisingly, activating PI3K mutations\n\nin CRC do not promote mTORC1 signaling or oncogenic growth.\n\nMoreover, the expression of several other mTORC1 activators\n\nsuch as Rheb and Rag is not correlated with mTORC1 activity.\n764 Cancer Cell 26, 754\u2013769, November 10, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc\nThese observations suggest that tumors selectively activate\n\nRab1A-dependent mTORC1 signaling through Rab1A overex-\n\npression to gain an oncogenic advantage.\n\nAlthough Rab1A expression has been reported to be elevated\n\nin tongue cancer, the significance of Rab1 overexpression\n\nremained unclear. Here we show that Rab1A overexpression is\n\nsufficient to transform immortalized fibroblasts and promote\n\nmalignant growth of established tumor cells, suggesting that\n\nRab1A is capable of promoting both oncogenic transforma-\n\ntion and growth.

Remark-\n\nably, CRC cells with Rab1A overexpression are highly depen-\n\ndent on AA, suggesting that elevated AA signaling renders can-\n\ncer cells addictive to AA. AA signaling is increasingly recognized\n\nas a key mitogenic event, but its role in cancer remains relative\n\nobscure. A recent study implicated GATOR, the GTPase-acti-\n\nvating protein (GAP) for Rag A/RagB as potential tumor suppres-\n\nsor (Bar-Peled et al., 2013). However, genomic mutation of\n\nGATOR components appears to be relatively rare. In contrast,\n\nRab1A overexpression is widespread in human malignancies,\n\nsuggesting that aberrant AA signaling as a result of Rab1 over-\n\nexpression is a common mechanism to promote oncogenic\n\ntransformation and growth.\n\nmTOR is a major cancer therapeutic target (Bjornsti and\n\nHoughton, 2004; Tsang et al., 2007), with two rapalogs (temsiro-\n\nlimus and everolimus) presently used in the clinic. Although\n\nupstream regulators of mTORC1 such as PI3K and PTEN are\n\ncommonly mutated in human tumors, such mutations have not\n\ncorrelated well with clinical responses (Don and Zheng, 2011).\n\nThis is consistent with the observations that PI3K mutant is not\n\nresponsible for mTORC1 activation and that it promotes survival\n\nrather than oncogenic growth in CRC (Samuels et al., 2005).\n\nOur data indicate that Rab1A overexpression is a driver for\n\nmTORC1-dependent growth, which is correlated with CRC\n\nsensitivity to rapamycin. Further research in this area could\n\nlead to a predictive biomarker for improving mTORC1-targeted\n\ntherapy. In addition to cancer, Rab1A is upregulated in a dilated\n\ncardiomyopathy model, and heart-specific Rab1A transgenes\n\nare sufficient to cause cardiac hypertrophy in a gene dosage-\n\ndependent manner in mice (Wu et al., 2001). It is noteworthy\n\nthat rapamycin is effective to regress established cardiac\n\nhypertrophy (McMullen et al., 2004). Our findings here provide\n\na mechanistic explanation for the pathological role of Rab1A in\n\ncancer and cardiac hypertrophy.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nPlasmids and Site-Directed Mutagenesis\n\nThe human Rab1A plasmid was a gift from Dr. Marci A. Scidmore (Rzomp\n\net al., 2003). The plasmids expressing HA-GST-Rheb1, HA-GST-Rap2A,\n\nHA-GST-RagB(Q99L), (RagBGTP), and RagC(S75L) (RagCGDP) (Sancak\n\net al., 2008) were acquired from AddGene. To generate Rab1A-GFP and\n\nRab1A-HA, Rab1A cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRV and NotI sites of\n\npEGFP-C1 and the SalI and NotI sites of pRK5, respectively. Raptor and\n\nRictor cDNAs were subcloned into the AscI and MluI sites of pCMV6-AN-\n\nMyc. Rab1AGTP (Q70L), Rab1AGDP (S22N), and Rab1AC2S (C202, 203S) were\n\ngenerated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing.\n(E) Representative images of the anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 or N\n\n(F and G) NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing GFP or GFP-Rab1A were injected subc\n\nevery 3 days.

The Tor1-\n\nspecific antibody has been described previously (Li et al., 2006). Horseradish\n\nperoxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were from Santa-Cruz Biotech-\n\nnology. Antibodies for mTOR (catalog no. 2983), Raptor (catalog no. 2280),\n\nRheb (catalog no. 4935), RagA (catalog no. 4537), RagB (catalog no. 8150),\n\nRagC (catalog no. 5466), RagD (catalog no. 4470), Lamp1 (catalog no.\n\n9091), Rictor, P-S6K1(T398), S6K1, P-AKT(S473), AKT, P-4E-BP1(T37/46),\n\n4E-BP1, ERK, P-ERK(T202/Y204), a-tubulin, and the Myc-epitope were from\n\nCell Signaling Technology. The antibody for the HA epitope was from Bethyl\n\nLaboratories. The antibodies for Rab1A and P-S6K1(T398) for IHC and the\n\nLamp2 antibody (catalog no. ab25630) were from Abcam. The antibody for\n\nRab1A (catalog no. 11671 for western blot and immunoprecipitation IP) and\n\nRab1B were from Proteintech Group. The Rab1A antibody for immunofluo-\n\nrescence (IF) (catalog no. H00005861-M07A) was from Abnova. Protein G-\n\nSepharose was from GE Healthcare. EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor\n\ncocktail and PhosSTOP were from Roche. Rapamycin and PD98059 were\n\nfrom Selleck Chemicals. Cell lysis and western blot (Drenan et al., 2004; San-\n\ncak et al., 2008) and immunoprecipitation (Sancak et al., 2008) were performed\n\nas described previously. For determining whether Ratpor or mTOR mediates\n\nthe interaction with Rab1A, anti-Rab1A immunoprecipitates were washed\n\nwith cell lysis buffer containing 0.25% or 0.50% TX-100.\n\nXenograft Tumors and Drug Therapy in Athymic Nude Mice\n\nTo generate xenograft tumors, a total of 53 106 to 13 107 cells in 100 ml PBS\n\nwere injected subcutaneously into 4-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. The\n\ntumor volume was measured using a Vernier caliper and calculated according\n\nto the formula tumor volume (mm3) = (shorter diameter23 longer diameter) / 2.\n\nThe tumor volume was measured every other day and is presented as\n\nmeans \u00b1 SD. At the endpoint, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were removed\n\nand photographed. For drug therapy experiments, DLD-1 and RKO cells\n\nwere injected subcutaneously into nude mice to establish a xenograft model.\n\nAfter tumors were established, rapamycin was administered with 5 mg/kg\n\nrapamycin dissolved in DMSO and sterile saline by daily intraperitoneal injec-\n\ntions for 10\u201312 days. Drug vehicle-treated mice received a daily injection\n\nof identical solution without rapamycin. At least six mice were included in\n\neach treatment group. Animal experiments were approved by Rutgers and\n\nShanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM) Animal Care\n\nand Use committees.\n\nCRC Tissue Array and Immunohistochemistry\n\nNinety pairs of deidentified malignant infiltrating CRC tumors with paired\n\nnoncancerous samples (cutting edge of surgical excision beyond 5 cm\n\nfrom the cancer areas) were randomly obtained from July 2006 to August\n\n2007. The CRC tissue array was prepared by Shanghai OUTDO Biotech\n\n(Shanghai, China). The survival time was calculated from the day of operation\n\nto the end of the follow-up or the date of death because of the recurrence and\n\nmetastasis.

The streptavidin-biotin complex method was used in\n\nimmunohistochemistry to detect Rab1A and P-S6K1(T389). Primary anti-\n\nbodies against Rab1A and P-S6K1(T389) were used at a concentration of\n\n1:400 and 1:50, respectively. To score a tumor cell as positive, both cyto-\n\nplasmic and nuclear staining were counted. For the quantitative analysis, a\n\nHisto score (H score) was calculated based on the staining intensity and per-\n\ncentage of stained cells using the Aperio ScanScope systems. The intensity\n\nscore was defined as follows: 0, no appreciable staining in cells; 1, weak\n\nstaining in cells comparable with stromal cells; 2, intermediate staining; 3,\n\nstrong staining. The fraction of positive cells was scored as 0%\u2013100%. The\n\nH score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score and the fraction\n\nscore, producing a total range of 0\u2013300. A cutoff of 30 was used for P-\n\nS6K1 positivity and 90 for Rab1A positivity. Tissue sections were examined\n\nand scored separately by two independent investigators blinded to the clini-\n\ncopathologic data.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SAS 9.13 software. The statistical\n\nanalysis of numeration data was done using Pearson\u2019s chi-square test or\n\nFisher\u2019s exact chi-square test. The comparisons of continuous data be-\n\ntween groups were performed using Student\u2019s t tests or Wilcoxon signed\n\nrank test. A nonparametric Spearman correlation test was performed to\n\nanalyze the correlation between Rab1A and P-S6K1 expression levels. For\n\nsurvival analysis, data collection was locked on August 16, 2011. Kaplan-\n\nMeier plots and log rank tests were applied to determine the significance\n\nof differences in cumulative survival. All statistical tests were conducted at\n\na two-sided significance level of 0.05.

The biochemical pathways\nthrough which CR3 regulates immunologic responses have not been fully characterized. Francisella tularensis is a remarkably\ninfectious, facultative intracellular pathogen of macrophages that causes tularemia. Early evasion of the host immune\nresponse contributes to the virulence of F. tularensis and CR3 is an important receptor for its phagocytosis. Here we confirm\nthat efficient attachment and uptake of the highly virulent Type A F. tularensis spp. tularensis strain Schu S4 by human\nmonocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) requires complement C3 opsonization and CR3. However, despite a.40-fold\nincrease in uptake following C3 opsonization, Schu S4 induces limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared\nwith non-opsonized Schu S4 and the low virulent F. novicida. This suggests that engagement of CR3 by opsonized Schu S4\ncontributes specifically to the immune suppression during and shortly following phagocytosis which we demonstrate by\nCD11b siRNA knockdown in hMDMs. This immune suppression is concomitant with early inhibition of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK\nand NF-kB activation. Furthermore, TLR2 siRNA knockdown shows that pro-inflammatory cytokine production and MAPK\nactivation in response to non-opsonized Schu S4 depends on TLR2 signaling providing evidence that CR3-TLR2 crosstalk\nmediates immune suppression for opsonized Schu S4. Deletion of the CD11b cytoplasmic tail reverses the CR3-mediated\ndecrease in ERK and p38 activation during opsonized Schu-S4 infection. The CR3-mediated signaling pathway involved in\nthis immune suppression includes Lyn kinase and Akt activation, and increased MKP-1, which limits TLR2-mediated pro-\ninflammatory responses. These data indicate that while the highly virulent F. tularensis uses CR3 for efficient uptake, optimal\nengagement of this receptor down-regulates TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory responses by inhibiting MAPK activation\nthrough outside-in signaling. CR3-linked immune suppression is an important mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of F.\ntularensis infection.\n\nCitation: Dai S, Rajaram MVS, Curry HM, Leander R, Schlesinger LS (2013) Fine Tuning Inflammation at the Front Door: Macrophage Complement Receptor 3-\nmediates Phagocytosis and Immune Suppression for Francisella tularensis.

These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrancisella tularensis is a remarkably infectious facultative intra-\n\ncellular pathogen that causes the zoonotic disease tularemia [1,2].\n\nF. tularensis can be divided into several subspecies, including\n\ntularensis, holarctica and mediasiatica [3,4], with tularensis being the\n\nmost virulent subspecies that can cause disease in humans through\n\nthe respiratory route with ,10 CFUs. F. novicida is normally\n\nconsidered to be the fourth subspecies of F. tularensis; however,\n\nrecent genome-wide polymorphism analysis indicates that it is an\n\nindependent species [5]. F. novicida rarely causes disease in humans\n\nbut is virulent in mice, manifesting a disease that is similar to\n\ntularemia in humans, and has been widely used in the mouse\n\nmodel of tularemia. Because F. tularensis can be easily disseminat-\n\ned, results in a high mortality rate among untreated pulmonary\n\ncases, and has the potential to cause public panic, it is given the\n\nhighest priority classification by the Centers for Disease Control\n\nand Prevention (CDC) as a Category A select agent and is a\n\npotential bioweapon [1].\n\nMacrophages are the first line of defense against invading\n\nmicroorganisms. However, as is the case for many other intracel-\n\nlular pathogens, F. tularensis is able to avoid and/or suppress\n\nmacrophage host defense mechanisms to enable survival and\n\nintracellular replication following phagocytosis. F. tularensis infects\n\nprimarily alveolar macrophages in pneumonic tularemia [6].\n\nMacrophages combat F. tularensis infection by generating TLR2-\n\ndependent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-1b\n[7\u201312]. However, this cytokine response is largely muted at the early\n\nstage of F. tularensis infection. In fact, several studies have indicated\n\nthat F. tularensis infection leads to broad immune suppression in\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\ninfected cells [13\u201316]. Compared with the low virulent F. novicida,\n\ninfection of human phagocytes with the highly virulent Type A F.\n\ntularensis subsp. tularensis strain Schu S4 leads to significantly reduced\n\npro-inflammatory cytokine production [17,18]. This immune\n\nsuppression is believed to be critical for the success of F. tularensis\n\nas a human pathogen, allowing for its replication and dissemination\n\nwithin the host early on. However, the molecular mechanisms\n\ninvolved in the early F. tularensis-induced immune suppression are\n\nnot completely understood.\n\nMultiple receptors, such as complement receptors, Fcc recep-\ntors, mannose receptor, scavenger receptor and surface nucleolin\n\nhave all been implicated in F. tularensis phagocytosis [19\u201324].\n\nComplement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface, and\n\ncomplement receptors, specifically complement receptor 3 (CR3)\n\non the macrophage surface play important roles in the uptake of\n\nthe highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis by human\n\nmacrophages [20,21,25]. CR3 (CD11b/CD18, aMb2) belongs to\nthe b2-integrin family. Complement receptors, particularly CR3,\nhave long been postulated to allow for safe passage for intracellular\n\npathogens [26\u201328]. CR3\u2019s function is dependent on the activation\n\nof outside-in and inside-out two way signals [29]. There is\n\nincreasing evidence for signaling crosstalk between complement\n\nreceptors and TLRs [30\u201332]. For example, TLR2 is able to trans-\n\nactivate CR3 through inside-out signaling including the activation\n\nof Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34]. b2-integrin signaling can\nalso negatively regulate TLR responses [32,35]. Specifically, CR3\n\ncan inhibit TLR4 signaling by promoting the degradation of\n\nMyD88 and TRIF [36]. In addition, engagement of CR3 has been\n\nshown to down-regulate IL-12 production [37] and avoid\n\ninitiation of the oxidative burst in macrophages following\n\nphagocytosis of apoptotic cells [38,39]. A few pathogens such as\n\nPorphyromonas gingivalis [33], Mycobacterium bovis BCG [34] and\n\nBacillus anthracis spores [40] can activate CR3 through inside-out\n\nsignaling via TLR2 to facilitate bacterial uptake. However, to the\n\nbest of our knowledge, nothing is known about how the\n\nengagement of CR3 by a pathogen (i.e. outside-in signaling) can\n\nmediate regulation of TLR signaling pathways.\n\nHere we hypothesized that the initial interaction of F. tularensis\n\nwith human macrophage receptors will greatly impact the\n\ngeneration of early signals and consequent biological responses\n\nby the macrophage. We show that C3-opsonized virulent F.\n\ntularensis subsp. tularensis utilizes CR3 to gain access into host\n\nmacrophages while at the same time inhibits TLR2-mediated host\n\nimmune responses, resulting in a relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019 mode of entry\n\nfollowed by robust intracellular replication. We also report the key\n\nsignaling pathways involved. Thus, we provide the first evidence\n\nfor linkage between a key phagocytic receptor for F. tularensis and\n\npost-phagocytic signaling events important in immunosuppression.\n\nThe involvement of complement receptors in immune suppression\n\nmay be an important mechanism for F. tularensis pathogenesis, and\n\nthe pathways involved are likely to be broadly applicable to other\n\nintracellular pathogens that use CR3-mediated entry.\n\nResults\n\nSerum opsonization, specifically C3 deposition, is critical\nfor F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 phagocytosis by\nhuman macrophages\n\nSerum components, specifically complement C3, and CR3 play\n\na major role in efficient macrophage uptake of F. tularensis Live\n\nVaccine Strain (LVS) and a clinical isolation (RCI) of subsp.\n\ntularensis [21]. We first set out to confirm the role of C3 and C3\n\nreceptors in Schu S4 phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived\n\nmacrophages (hMDMs). We infected hMDMs with Schu S4 in the\n\npresence or absence of serum, or in C3-depleted or C3-repleted\n\nserum. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of serum, Schu S4\n\nuptake by hMDMs was very limited. In contrast, in the presence of\n\nserum, the uptake was significantly increased ,40 fold confirming\nthat serum opsonization is critical for efficient phagocytosis of\n\nSchu S4 by human macrophages. Moreover, when we used C3-\n\ndepleted serum the uptake of Schu S4 was limited, equivalent to\n\nthat seen in the absence of serum. Repletion of C3-depleted serum\n\nwith C3 led to a significant increase in uptake akin to that seen\n\nfollowing serum opsonization. This result provides further\n\nevidence that serum components, especially C3 deposited on\n\nbacterial surface, are critical for efficient phagocytosis of Schu S4\n\nby human macrophages.\n\nC3 opsonization is associated with immune suppression\nduring Schu S4 phagocytosis by macrophages\n\nIn order to examine whether the initial interaction between F.\n\ntularensis and macrophages impacts host cell immune responses, we\n\nmeasured the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. TNFa, IL-6\nand IL-1b in the culture supernatant of hMDMs infected with\nSchu S4 in the absence or presence of fresh autologous serum.\n\nSurprisingly, despite the fact that there was a dramatic increase in\n\nbacterial uptake in the presence of serum, there was very limited\n\npro-inflammatory cytokine production suggesting that serum\n\nopsonization has an immunosuppressive effect during Schu S4\n\nphagocytosis. This effect is mainly contributed by C3 since\n\nincubation in C3-depleted serum led to relatively high levels of\n\ncytokine production comparable to those observed in the absence\n\nof serum, while the cytokine levels were decreased when C3 was\n\nrepleted (Fig. 2A, B and C). Recent studies have shown that the\n\nlow virulent F. novicida induces high pro-inflammatory responses in\n\nhuman phagocytic cells [17,41]. In order to exam whether serum\n\nincubation has an immunosuppressive effect during the phagocy-\n\ntosis of human macrophages by F. novicida, we performed assays\n\ncomparing F. novicida and Schu S4 in the presence and absence of\n\nserum. Consistent with previous studies [17,18], phagocytosis of F.\n\nnovicida by hMDMs was accompanied by much higher pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine production than that of Schu S4 (Fig. 2 D,\n\nE and F). In addition, serum did not have a significant immune\n\nsuppressive effect, indicating that C3 opsonin-mediated immune\n\nsuppression is specific to the highly virulent Schu S4.\n\nRecent studies have indicated that host adaptation can affect the\n\nnature of Francisella surface carbohydrates, which can in turn affect\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nThe highly virulent Francisella tularensis can cause respi-\nratory disease in humans with less than 10 bacteria. In vivo,\nit replicates mainly within macrophages. Evasion and/or\nsuppression of the host protective immune response is\nessential to Francisella\u2019s virulence in mammals. However,\nthe detailed molecular mechanisms for this immune\nsuppression are not clear. Here we demonstrate that this\npathogen manipulates the crosstalk between two impor-\ntant receptor-mediated pathways during entry in human\nmacrophages: CR3-mediated phagocytosis and TLR2-me-\ndiated pro-inflammatory responses. By optimally engaging\nCR3, Francisella not only gains efficient access to macro-\nphages but also dampens TLR2-mediated immune re-\nsponses, leading to a relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019 entry that allows it\nto replicate intracellularly to high numbers early on. Thus,\nwe have identified an important mechanism that is critical\nfor the success of F. tularensis as a human pathogen during\nprimary infection.\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

To\n\nexamine the effect of host adaptation on the immune suppression\n\nobserved here, we used Schu S4 that had been passaged through\n\nTHP-1 cells (Ft-T). As shown in Fig. S1, although host adapted Ft-\n\nT induced slightly less pro-inflammatory cytokine production\n\ncompared with Ft that had not been passaged, serum-opsonization\n\nstill significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory responses with Ft-T.\n\nThis result provides further support that the inhibition mechanism\n\nobserved here does not depend on host adaptation. Thus, the\n\nfollowing experiments were carried out with Ft Schu S4 only.\n\nC3 opsonization inhibits MAPK activation during\nphagocytosis of Schu S4 by human macrophages\n\nF. tularensis LPS interacts poorly with TLR4 [43]. Instead, host\n\ninflammatory responses to F. tularensis are mediated primarily by\n\nTLR2 which leads to the activation of MAPK and NF-kB\nsignaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production\n\n[44\u201349]. In order to explore the underlying mechanism for the\n\nsuppressed immune responses seen in the presence of serum and\n\nC3 opsonization, we examined the activation of MAPKs during\n\nSchu S4 synchronized phagocytosis. Schu S4 was either non-\n\nopsonized or pre-opsonized with fresh autologous serum, C3-\n\ndepleted or C3-repleted serum, and then incubated with hMDMs\n\nin the absence of serum. As shown in Fig. 3A, consistent with our\n\nobservations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, activation\n\nof MAPKs (i.e. ERK1/2 and p38) was inhibited during\n\nphagocytosis of serum-opsonized or C3-repleted serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4, whereas there was robust activation of ERK1/2 and p38\n\nin the absence of either serum or C3. This inhibition on MAPK\n\nactivation was only observed for ERK1/2 and p38, but not for\n\nJNK (Fig. 3B) In order to confirm the role of complement in the\n\nimmune suppression observed, we also infected hMDMs with\n\nSchu S4 pre-opsonized with heat-inactivated autologous serum.\n\nPhagocytosis of these bacteria was accompanied by levels of\n\nERK1/2 and p38 activation equivalent to those seen with non-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 (data not shown). Together, these data indicate\n\nthat the immune suppression during C3-opsonized Schu S4\n\nphagocytosis is mediated, at least in part, by reduced ERK1/2 and\n\np38 activation.\n\nSince we observed a much greater pro-inflammatory response\n\nduring F. novicida phagocytosis than during Schu S4 phagocytosis\n\n(which was not affected by serum or C3), we also included F.\n\nnovicida in parallel with Schu S4 in our experiments to assess\n\nMAPK activation. As expected, phagocytosis of F. novicida was\n\naccompanied by high levels of ERK1/2 and p38 activation both in\n\nthe presence and absence of serum, especially at the later time\n\npoint (Fig. 3C) and was much less affected by serum opsonization.\n\nThis indicates that C3-mediated MAPK inhibition is relatively\n\nspecific to the highly virulent Schu S4.\n\nC3 opsonization inhibits NF-kB p65 activation and\ntranslocation during phagocytosis of Schu S4 by human\nmacrophages\n\nPhosphorylation of MAPKs leads to activation of many\n\ntranscription factors, including NF-kB, that are important in\ninflammatory cytokine production. Since we observed significantly\n\ndecreased activation of ERK 1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4 infection, we examined whether this decreased activation\n\nleads to a reduction in downstream NF-kB activation. We infected\nhMDMs with non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4 for\n\ndifferent time points and analyzed NF-kB p65 activation (phos-\nphorylation) by Western blot. As predicted, phagocytosis of serum-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 led to significantly reduced phosphorylation of\n\nthe NF-kB p65 subunit (Fig. 4A and B). Activation of the NF-kB\np65 subunit leads to translocation of p65 into the nucleus where it\n\nbinds to the promoter region of various genes to induce their\n\nexpression. We measured NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleus\nby immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C). Our results show that\n\ninfection with serum-opsonized Sch S4 is accompanied by\n\nsignificantly reduced p65 translocation compared to that of non-\n\nopsonized bacteria. These data provide strong evidence that C3\n\nopsonization of bacteria leads to early suppression of the host cell\n\nimmune response through inhibition of MAPKs and downstream\n\nNF-kB activation.\n\nC3 opsonin-mediated immune suppression during\nphagocytosis is not due to a difference in the kinetics of\nuptake of Schu S4 or to bacterial factors\n\nOne possible mechanism for the enhanced pro-inflammatory\n\ncytokine response seen during phagocytosis of non-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 is that limited CR3 engagement slows phagocytosis (through\n\nCR3 or potentially other receptors) allowing for a proportionately\n\nincreased number of attached bacteria to engage TLR2 for a\n\nlonger period of time. In order to test for this possibility, we\n\nsynchronized phagocytosis of non-opsonized or serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4 as in the MAPK activation assay, and fixed the samples at\n\ndifferent time points. We used a differential immunofluorescence\n\nstaining protocol [50] to quantify the attachment and uptake of\n\nSchu S4 by hMDMs (Fig. 5A). At all time points examined (5, 15\n\nand 30 min) there were much greater numbers of serum-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 both attached to and taken up by hMDMs\n\ncompared with non-opsonized bacteria, indicating that a differ-\n\nence in the kinetics of phagocytosis was not the reason for the\n\nobserved immune suppression. The fact that F. tularensis can also\n\nsignal through TLR2 from within phagosomes following phago-\n\ncytosis [51] also argues against the hypothesis that in the case of\n\nnon-opsonized bacteria, prolonged cell surface binding results in\n\nenhanced cytokine production.\n\nBacterial virulence factors, e.g. RipA, represent an alternate\n\nmechanism of immune suppression by C3-opsonized bacteria\n\n[52]. In this scenario, we expect cytokine production to decline as\n\nbacterial loads increase because the concentration of virulence\n\nfactors produced from viable bacteria within a macrophage is\n\ndirectly proportional to its bacterial load. In order to test this\n\nhypothesis, we infected hMDMs with non-opsonized or serum pre-\n\nopsonized Schu S4. In both cases we achieved an incremental\n\nincrease in bacterial uptake by increasing the MOI. However,\n\ninstead of resulting in increased immune suppression, increased\n\nuptake resulted in a stepwise increase in pro-inflammatory\n\ncytokine production (Fig. 5B) and MAPK activation (Fig. 5C).\n\nThis effect was more pronounced in the case of non-opsonized\n\nbacteria [i.e., A 20 fold increase in MOI resulted in a 3 to 12 fold\n\nincrease in cytokine production for non-opsonized bacteria, and\n\nonly a 30% to 70% increase in cytokine production for opsonized\n\nbacteria (Fig. 5B)]. These results indicate that early immune\n\nsuppression by Schu S4 during phagocytosis is not primarily\n\nmediated by virulence factors produced from viable bacteria. We\n\ncarried out experiments with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-killed Schu\n\nS4 to further support this claim. In parallel with untreated Schu\n\nS4, PFA-killed Schu S4 was either non-opsonized or serum pre-\n\nopsonized, and used for infection. As shown in Fig. 5D, PFA-killed\n\nserum-opsonized Schu S4 was able to inhibit MAPK activation.\n\nTogether, these results provide evidence that the immune\n\nsuppression observed during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 is not due to actively produced bacterial factors. However,\n\nthese factors are predicted to play an important role during\n\nsubsequent stages of infection.\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nCR3 is the major receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis by\nhuman macrophages\n\nWe next examined the role of C3 receptors and the possible\n\ncrosstalk between C3 receptors and TLR2 in mediating the\n\nimmune suppression during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized Schu\n\nS4. We elected to focus on CR3 (CD11b/CD18) which is the\n\nmajor receptor for C3 opsonins, and has been implicated as the\n\nimportant receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis by human phago-\n\ncytes [21]. We transfected hMDMs with scramble siRNA (control)\n\nor siRNA targeting CD11b, the latter to knockdown the a chain of\nthe CR3 heterodimer (Fig. 6A and B). We then performed\n\nexperiments that quantify attachment and uptake of Schu S4 by\n\ncontrol and CD11b knockdown macrophages. Compared to\n\ncontrol siRNA transfected hMDMs, Schu S4 attachment and\n\nuptake were nearly abolished in CD11b knockdown cells,\n\nproviding strong confirmatory evidence that CR3 is the major\n\nreceptor for phagocytosis of the highly virulent Schu S4 strain by\n\nhuman macrophages (Fig. 6C and D).\n\nSeveral studies have indicated crosstalk between complement\n\nreceptor pathways and TLR pathways, especially for the\n\ninvolvement of TLRs in inside-out activation of CR3 [33,34,40].\n\nTherefore, we tested the possible involvement of TLR2 in Schu S4\n\nphagocytosis by hMDMs, since TLR2 is responsible for most of\n\nthe cell surface TLR-driven host inflammatory responses following\n\nFigure 3.

We knocked down TLR2 in\n\nhMDMs using siRNA as we have described previously [53] and\n\nexamined Schu S4 attachment and uptake by these cells.\n\nCompared with control siRNA transfected cells, there was an\n\napproximately 40% reduction in the attachment and uptake of\n\nSchu S4 in TLR2 siRNA transfected cells (thus less than that\n\nobserved with CD11b knockdown cells) at 15 min (Fig. 6C and D),\n\nwhich is consistent with the involvement of TLR2 in F. tularensis\n\nphagocytosis, possibly through inside-out activation of CR3.\n\nSimilar data were seen at 5 min and a similar trend was seen at\n\n30 min, although at the later time point the high number of\n\nbacteria per cell reduced the accuracy of the counting (Fig. S2).\n\nInside-out signaling is further supported by an experiment showing\n\nthat the cytoskeletal, actin-binding protein Talin co-localizes with\n\nCR3, particularly in macrophages infected with serum pre-\n\nopsonized Ft (Fig. S3) [54].\n\nPhagocytosis-associated immune suppression of C3-\nopsonized F. tularensis is mediated by CR3\n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that engagement of C3 receptors\n\nenables outside-in crosstalk with the TLR2 pathway to inhibit\n\nTLR2-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory responses, we\n\nexamined cytokine production in CD11b or TLR2 knockdown\n\nmacrophages following phagocytosis of serum-opsonized versus\n\nnon-opsonized Schu S4 or F. novicida. We observed a significant\n\nreduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in TLR2 knock-\n\ndown cells following non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4\n\ninfection, consistent with a role for TLR2 in mediating host pro-\n\ninflammatory immune responses (Fig. 7A). However, even in\n\nTLR2 knockdown cells, cytokine production in response to serum-\n\nopsonized bacteria remained depressed as compared to non-\n\nopsonized bacteria, indicating that the immunosuppressive effects\n\nof complement C3 in conjunction with Schu S4 do not depend on\n\nTLR2. In contrast, in CD11b knockdown cells, we observed that\n\nthe selective immune suppression seen with opsonized bacteria was\n\nabolished, providing evidence for CR3 in mediating immune\n\nsuppression following optimal engagement by C3-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 (Fig. 7B). As observed before, there was robust pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine production following phagocytosis of F.\n\nnovicida independent of opsonization status.\n\nWe next examined MAPK activation upstream of cytokine\n\nproduction following phagocytosis of Schu S4 by control, CD11b or\n\nTLR2 knockdown hMDMs. In order to detect and examine the\n\nsignaling events immediately after receptor ligation, we increased\n\nthe MOI to 250:1 and collected samples at 5, 15 and 30 min post\n\ninfection. As shown in Fig. 7C, in control siRNA transfected cells,\n\nboth ERK and p38 activation were selectively inhibited upon\n\ninfection with serum pre-opsonized bacteria compared with non-\n\nopsonized bacteria, although maximal inhibition of each occurred\n\nat different time points (ERK and p38 activation were significantly\n\nlower at 5 min and 30 min post infection, respectively). Similar to\n\nthe results in Fig. 7A, in TLR2 knockdown cells MAPK activation\n\nwas reduced and the overall pattern between opsonized and non-\n\nopsonized bacteria was maintained; whereas in CD11b knockdown\n\nFigure 4.

We found that the tail less\n\nmutant form of CR3 was not able to inhibit the activation of\n\nERK1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonized Schu-S4 phagocytosis\n\n(Fig. 8A). To further validate that CR3 is an important receptor\n\nfor serum-opsonized Schu S4, we performed a cell association\n\nassay with serum-opsonized or non-opsonized bacteria and CHO\n\ncells expressing full length or tail less mutant CR3.

The\n\nhighly virulent Schu S4 exploits host defense mechanisms by using\n\nCR3 as the phagocytic receptor which suppresses host defense\n\nimmune responses by inhibiting MAPK activation. However, the\n\nquestion still remained as to the signaling cascade downstream of\n\nCR3 that leads to MAPK inhibition.\n\nA recent study [29] showed that CD11b can negatively regulate\n\nTLR signaling by activating Syk and promoting the degradation of\n\nMyD88 and TRIF. To explore this possibility, we examined the\n\nactivation of Syk upon infection with serum-opsonized or non-\n\nopsonized Schu S4. Our results indicated that Syk is transiently\n\nactivated upon Schu S4 infection, but there is no difference\n\nbetween serum-opsonized and non-opsonized Schu S4 infection at\n\nall time points studied (5, 15 and 30 min). Also MyD88 and TRIF\n\nprotein levels following serum-opsonized and non-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 infection are not changed (data not shown). Thus, these data\n\nsuggested that neither Syk nor Syk-mediated degradation of\n\nMyD88 and TRIF is involved in CR3-mediated immune\n\nsuppression in human macrophages.\n\nCR3 belongs to the b2 integrin family. Src family kinases (SFKs)\nHck, Fgr and Lyn are known to control b2 integrin signal\ntransduction in leukocytes [57]. Among these we were particularly\n\ninterested in Lyn since it has been shown to play an important role\n\nin host defense. Lyn deletion led to impaired phagocytosis,\n\nelevated inflammatory cytokine production and increased apop-\n\ntosis following Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [58]. Lyn also\n\nnegatively regulates TLR4 and TLR2 signaling in mouse\n\nmacrophages and in vivo, which is partially mediated by the\n\nPI3K pathway [59].\n\nIn order to answer the question whether Lyn is involved in\n\nCR3-mediated host immune suppression following Schu S4\n\ninfection, we first explored whether Lyn is activated downstream\n\nof CR3 and if so, whether its activation is affected by TLR2\n\nactivation which can activate CR3 through inside-out signaling.\n\nhMDMs were transfected with control siRNA, or siRNA targeting\n\nCD11b or TLR2, and then infected with either serum-opsonized\n\nor non-opsonized Schu S4. Lyn activation was measured by\n\nWestern blot. As shown in Fig. 9A, in control siRNA transfected\n\ncells, Lyn was activated only when hMDMs were infected with\n\nserum pre-opsonized Schu S4 but not with non-opsonized Schu\n\nS4, consistent with the importance of C3 opsonization in Lyn\n\nFigure 6.

These\n\nresults demonstrated that Lyn is activated downstream of CR3 but\n\nnot TLR2.\n\nIn order to explore whether CR3-mediated host immune\n\nsuppression is mediated by Lyn, we selectively knocked down Lyn\n\nby siRNA as described previously [60] (Fig. 9B). As shown in Fig\n\nS4, Lyn knockdown greatly impaired the uptake of Schu S4 by\n\nhMDMs, providing evidence that Lyn is required for CR3-\n\nmediated phagocytosis. The effect of Lyn on the host immune\n\nresponse was assessed by inflammatory cytokine production\n\nfollowing Schu S4 infection. Compared with the limited immune\n\nresponse in control siRNA transfected cells, Lyn knockdown led to\n\na significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production,\n\nincluding TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1b, following serum-opsonized Schu\nS4 infection (Fig. 9C) despite the impaired uptake, providing\n\nevidence for a critical role of Lyn in CR3-mediated host immune\n\nsuppression following Schu S4 infection.\n\nCR3 engagement leads to Akt activation and increased\nMKP-1 expression\n\nThe PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to play a central role in\n\nthe host immune response during F. novicida infection [18],\n\nincluding the production of TNFa [61]. In contrast, a recent study\nindicated that this pathway is involved in the immune suppression\n\nfollowing LVS infection of mouse macrophages [62]. In support of\n\na role of PI3K/Akt in F. tularensis immune modulation, Lyn has\n\nbeen shown to form a complex with PI3K/Akt in different cell\n\ntypes [63,64] while TLR2 can also activate the PI3K/Akt pathway\n\nthrough Rac1 [65]. In order to examine whether the PI3K/Akt\n\npathway is involved in CR3-mediated immune suppression and\n\ncrosstalk with the TLR2 signaling pathway we infected control\n\nsiRNA, CD11b siRNA or TLR2 siRNA-transfected hMDMs with\n\nserum pre-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 and then\n\nexamined the activation of this pathway by Western blot. As\n\nshown in Fig. 9A, 30 min after infection, the phospho-Akt level\n\nwas consistently greater in hMDMs infected with serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4, compared with hMDMs infected with non-opsonized\n\nbacteria, indicating that optimal engagement of CR3 at least\n\ntransiently activates Akt. This was further supported by CD11b\n\nknockdown, which abolished the enhanced Akt activation seen in\n\ncells infected with serum pre-opsonized Schu S4 (below the level\n\nseen with non-opsonized bacteria). Besides CR3, TLR2 is also\n\ninvolved in Akt activation following Schu S4 infection (Fig. 9A).\n\nThis was indicated by the increased level of phospho-Akt when\n\ncells are infected with non-opsonized bacteria which will engage\n\nCR3 in a limited fashion. Moreover, the increase seen following\n\nserum pre-opsonization was reduced in TLR2 siRNA transfected\n\ncells. As Akt is downstream of both pathways this could be an\n\nimportant point where the two pathways crosstalk.\n\nFigure 7.

MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) can dephos-\n\nphorylate both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues\n\nthus serving as important negative regulators of MAPKs [66]. In\n\norder to examine if MKPs are involved in CR3-mediated immune\n\nsuppression, we assessed MKP-1 levels during Schu S4 infection of\n\nhMDMs. Consistent with our observation of increased Akt and\n\ndecreased MAPK levels upon infection with serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4, the MKP-1 level also increased rapidly after serum pre-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 infection but not following infection with non-\n\nopsonized bacteria, suggesting a role for CR3 engagement.\n\nConsistent with this possibility, the increased MKP-1 level was\n\nabolished when CD11b was knocked down (Fig. 9A). In contrast,\n\nthere was no effect following TLR2 knockdown. Together, these\n\ndata map a pathway for CR3-mediated immune suppression that\n\nincludes activation of Lyn and Akt, and an increased level of\n\nMKP-1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nF. tularensis is highly virulent with a very low dose of infection,\n\nwhich is often lethal before a fully effective adaptive immune\n\nresponse can be mounted [67,68]. This high virulence and rapid\n\nlethality are at least partially due to the ability of F. tularensis to\n\nsubvert or suppress host pro-inflammatory immune responses\n\n[16,69]. F. tularensis infection of macrophages and dendritic cells\n\nleads to very limited secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines\n\nIL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa [13\u201315,70] and unresponsiveness to\nsubsequent stimulation by TLR agonists [14,15]. In the current\n\nstudy, we provide evidence for a pathway that links CR3-mediated\n\nphagocytosis for F. tularensis with immune suppression that involves\n\ncrosstalk with TLR2.\n\nComplement component C3 deposition on the F. tularensis\n\nsurface has been previously characterized [25,71], and optimal\n\nuptake of the highly virulent strain by human macrophages\n\nrequires C3 deposition and its receptor CR3 [21]. Despite the fact\n\nthat significantly more bacteria are phagocytosed by human\n\nmacrophages in the presence of serum or C3, to our surprise we\n\nobserved very limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production along\n\nwith decreased activation of MAPK ERK1/2 and p38, and NF-\n\nkB under this condition. We excluded the possibilities that this C3-\nmediated immune suppression was due to a difference in the\n\nkinetics of phagocytosis or possible involvement of certain bacterial\n\ncomponents/virulence factors, and confirmed the role of CR3 in\n\nthis immune suppression via siRNA knockdown of the receptor.\n\nFurther we provide direct evidence for the requirement of the\n\nCR3 cytoplasmic tail for C3 opsonized F. tularensis-mediated\n\nsuppression of immune function in human macrophages. In\n\naddition we identify a pathway downstream of CR3 leading to\n\nimmune suppression that includes Lyn, Akt and MKP-1. The\n\nengagement of CR3 leads to activation of Lyn, and the role of Lyn\n\nin immune suppression was confirmed by siRNA knockdown.\n\nCR3 engagement also led to transient activation of Akt and an\n\nincreased level of MKP-1. These findings are consistent with the\n\ninhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 activation as well as limited pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine production following Schu S4 infection.\n\nThus, we identify a key pathway that links a receptor critical for F.\n\ntularensis phagocytosis with post-phagocytic signaling events\n\nimportant for immune suppression following Schu S4 infection,\n\nand the crosstalk downstream of two critical receptors in innate\n\nimmunity: CR3 and TLR2 (Fig. 10).\n\nThe crosstalk revealed here is complex and involves interactions\n\nbetween TLR2 signaling and both inside-out and outside-in\n\nsignaling of CR3 by F. tularensis. First, CR3 is required for efficient\n\nF. tularensis phagocytosis while TLR2 is also partially involved.\n\nThis is likely through inside-out activation of CR3 which proceeds\n\nthrough Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34] and involves the\n\nactin cytoskeleton-binding protein talin (Fig. S3). The activated\n\nCR3 will then efficiently bind C3bi-coated bacteria, generate CR3\n\noutside-in signaling involving Lyn and Akt, and negatively regulate\n\nTLR2-mediated immune responses by limiting the activation of\n\nMAPKs through increased MKP-1. Another possibility we cannot\n\nexclude from our studies is that the inhibition of TLR2 signaling\n\nhappens at the level of receptor ligation. For example, it is possible\n\nthat C3 deposition on F. tularensis can block the recognition of\n\nTLR2 ligands on the bacterial surface. In this regard, a recent\n\nstudy showed that F. tularensis grown in different media has distinct\n\nbacterial surface structures, which in certain cases shields TLR2\n\nligands on the bacterial surface and consequently blocks the host\n\nimmune response [42]. The net result of CR3 engagement by F.\n\ntularensis is efficient phagocytosis and limited immune response.\n\nAlthough CR3 is present on the very cells that are meant to\n\ncontrol F. tularensis infection, it allows for a relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019\n\nmeans of entry to macrophages.\n\nWe consistently observed a difference in the kinetics of ERK1/2\n\nand p38 inhibition in our study. While the inhibition of ERK1/2\n\noccurred as early as 5 min post infection, inhibition of p38 was not\n\noptimal until 30 min (Fig. 7B). This difference in kinetics has\n\nimplications for MKP-1 regulation and function. In our study, the\n\nlevel of MKP-1 was not increased until 15 to 30 minutes post\n\ninfection. In addition, although MKP-1 can deactivate ERK1/2\n\nwhen it is highly induced, p38 is its preferred substrate [66].\n\nTherefore taken together, although our current model of the\n\nsignaling cascade can explain the inhibition of p38 activation,\n\nother mechanisms are likely to be involved in the early inhibition\n\nof ERK1/2. Further studies are underway to characterize the\n\nmechanisms enabling early ERK1/2 inhibition. Insight is provid-\n\ned by the modeling of C3-opsonized F. tularensis engagement of\n\nCR3 [72].\n\nThe observed CR3-mediated immune suppression is relatively\n\nspecific to Schu S4. This is different from the immune suppression\n\nmediated by RipA, a Francisella protein that is conserved in all\n\nsubspecies [52]. In our studies, F. novicida induced a much more\n\nrobust immune response than Schu S4. In addition, serum or C3\n\nhad very little suppressive effect. F. novicida always has a much\n\nhigher phagocytosis rate than Schu S4 in the absence and presence\n\nof serum (data not shown) suggesting the two strains use different\n\nmeans of cellular entry. Thus, differences in the early immune\n\nresponse to Schu S4 and F. novicida can be at least partly due to\n\ntheir engaging different receptors during phagocytosis. For\n\nexample, it is possible that F. novicida more efficiently engages\n\nboth CR3 and Fcc receptors during phagocytosis, leading to a\nmore robust immune response. Abundant natural antibody has\n\nbeen found on the surface of F. novicida that is capable of engaging\n\nFcc receptors [19]. Consistent with the notion that immune\nsuppression is critical for the success of F. tularensis as a human\n\npathogen, Schu S4 is highly virulent in humans whereas F. novicida\n\nis not. Beyond this, our studies do not rule out differences in\n\nbacterial surface-exposed ligands between Schu S4 and F. novicida\n\nthat would still be present after PFA treating bacteria that could\n\nengage different receptors. We believe that differences in receptor-\n\nligand interactions at the macrophage surface will lead to\n\nsignificant differences in the host cell response due to associated,\n\nunique, combinatorial signaling events.\n\nThe negative regulatory role of the PI3K/Akt pathway on pro-\n\ninflammatory immune responses has been demonstrated in other\n\nstudies [73\u201375] including a recent study with LVS infection of\n\nmouse macrophages, which identified the role of Akt and MKP-1\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nin the immune suppression [62]. As LVS has a similar level of\n\nphagocytosis as Schu S4 (which is lower than that seen with F.\n\nnovicida), and efficient uptake also requires serum-opsonization\n\n[19], it is possible that LVS uses a similar pathway as Schu S4 for\n\nimmunosuppression. At a later stage of infection (24 h post\n\ninfection), F. novicida activates while Schu S4 inhibits the PI3K/Akt\n\npathway by differentially regulating SHIP-1 through induction of\n\nmiR-155 [41]. Our studies support the idea that the induction of\n\nbroad immune suppression by F. tularensis in the host occurs at\n\nmultiple levels and by different mechanisms during the course of\n\ninfection. The current study provides evidence that immune\n\nsuppression mechanisms are initiated at the earliest state of\n\ninfection, i.e. during the phagocytic process itself.\n\nIn addition to CR3, other complement receptors might also\n\nplay a role during F. tularensis phagocytosis. C3bi can also be\n\nrecognized by CR4 (CD11c/CD18) and CRIg [76]. These\n\nreceptors might also be involved in the immune suppression\n\nobserved during F. tularensis infection in the presence of serum. In\n\naddition, C1q is deposited on the F. tularensis surface (Clay CD &\n\nSchlesinger LS, manuscript in preparation). Interestingly, C1q\n\nsuppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by\n\nNF-kB inhibition and CREB activation [77\u201379]. Opsono-phago-\ncytosis of C1q-bound apoptotic cells occurs via CD91/calreticulin\n\n[80] and is immunosuppressive. Thus, it is intriguing to\n\nhypothesize that C1q receptors might also be involved in the\n\nimmune suppression observed here. We are further exploring this\n\npossibility.\n\nSignaling events associated with the complement system\n\nhave been examined in the case of other pathogens. For exam-\n\nple, P. gingivalis can cleave C5 to release C5a, which activates\n\nFigure 10. Model of CR3-mediated immune suppression and crosstalk with TLR2 signaling during the phagocytosis of Schu S4 by\nhuman macrophages. In the absence of serum, pathogen associated molecular determinants such as lipoproteins will be recognized by TLR2\nwhich activates MAP kinase (ERK1/2 and p38) and NF-kB signaling pathways, and induces host pro-inflammatory responses. Phagocytosis is limited\nwithout the optimal engagement of CR3. In the presence of serum C3bi is deposited on the Ft Schu S4 surface, which optimally engages CR3 and\nenhances phagocytosis. At the same time, TLR2 is activated at least to some degree, leading to inside-out activation of CR3, which contributes to\nenhanced outside-in CR3 signaling and increased phagocytosis. CR3-mediated signaling activates Lyn and AKT, and leads to an increased MKP-1 level\nwhich results in inhibition of MAPK activity. This allows for increased phagocytosis simultaneously with a dampened host immune response.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g010\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nintracellular Ca2+ signaling and cAMP, leading to impaired\n\niNOS-dependent killing in macrophages [81]. P. gingivalis can\n\nactivate CR3 through inside-out activation downstream of\n\nTLR2 signaling, induces ERK1/2, and selectively down-\n\nregulates IL-12 expression [82,83]. Blastomyces dermatitidis uses\n\nBAD1, a virulent factor on the pathogen surface to engage CR3\n\nfor TNFa suppression and immune evasion by unknown\nmechanisms [84]. In addition to its role in the phagocytosis of\n\nbacteria, CR3 is also responsible for clearance of C3bi-coated\n\napoptotic cells without initiating vigorous immune responses\n\n[85]. In this context, CR3 ligation is immunosuppressive [86]\n\nand can inhibit IL-12 production [37,87]. Although inside-out\n\nactivation of CR3 through TLR2 has been reported for other\n\npathogens [33,34,40], our data provide evidence that F. tularensis\n\nis able to take advantage of both inside-out and outside-in\n\nsignaling of CR3 to achieve efficient entry as well as immune\n\nsuppression for its own survival. Thus, we provide new\n\ninformation on how outside-in signaling of CR3 by a pathogen\n\ncan negatively regulate TLR signaling. CR3 is a major receptor\n\nfor intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacteria [88], Leishmania\n\n[89,90] and Legionella [91]. Therefore it will be interesting to\n\ninvestigate whether these pathogens also employ similar\n\nsignaling mechanisms related to CR3 in order to enhance their\n\nsurvival during infection. In this regard, during infection of\n\nmurine macrophages with Mycobacterium avium, C3-depletion\n\nresults in a significantly higher level of TNFa production [92].\nTLR2, PI3K and cytohesin-1 mediated inside-out activation of\n\nCR3 has also been found to play a role in the phagocytosis of\n\nMycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [34]. In the\n\ncase of Leishmania, ligation of CR3 has been shown to inhibit the\n\nproduction of IL-12 [93].\n\nDuring the course of our studies, we entertained the idea of\n\nextending them to the mouse model using CR3 knockout mice.\n\nWe first examined the activation of ERK, p38 and Akt during\n\nserum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 synchronized\n\nphagocytosis by mouse bone marrow derived macrophages\n\n(BMDMs) from wild type C57/Bl mice. In stark contrast to the\n\nresults obtained with human macrophages, the activation of\n\nERK and p38 was significantly enhanced in mouse BMDMs\n\nincubated with serum-opsonized Schu S4 compared to non-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 (Fig. S5). This result indicates that the C3\n\nopsonin-mediated inhibitory effect of Schu S4 on MAPKs is\n\nspecific to human macrophages. In this regard, there is\n\ngrowing evidence that the mouse model does not recapitulate\n\nhuman disease for a number of infectious agents. In fact, both\n\nSchu S4 and F. novicida are highly virulent in mice whereas\n\nonly the former is highly virulent in humans. Beyond this, we\n\nand others are beginning to see major differences between\n\nmice and man (and their cells), particularly in the innate\n\nimmune system, where the array of PRRs on macrophages, for\n\nexample, and their signaling cascades are quite different\n\n[94,95].\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate a pathway that links an\n\nimportant phagocytic receptor, CR3, on human macrophages\n\nwith the down-regulation of host immune responses that allows\n\nfor an efficient, but relatively \u2018\u2018silent\u2019\u2019 mode of entry of the\n\nhighly virulent F. tularensis. This involves active crosstalk\n\nbetween CR3- and TLR2-mediated signaling pathways. CR3-\n\nmediated immune suppression can be an important strategy\n\nused by F. tularensis for its success as a human pathogen. These\n\nresults have broader implications in understanding the patho-\n\ngenesis of other intracellular pathogens as well as the crosstalk\n\nbetween different PRRs and phagocytic receptors, especially\n\nTLRs and integrins.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nBacterial strains\nF. novicida U112 (Fn) was obtained from ATCC and F. tularensis\n\nsubspecies tularensis Schu S4 strain (Ft) was generously provided by\n\nDr. Rick Lyons (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO).\n\nThe bacteria were cultured on Chocolate II plates (Becton\n\nDickinson, Sparks, MD).

After 2\u20133 hrs of attachment at\n\n37uC with 5% CO2 hMDM monolayers were washed with warm\nRPMI, repleted with warm RPMI containing 20% autologous\n\nserum, and incubated at 37uC 5% CO2 for additional 48 hrs.\n\nCHO cell TLR2 transfection\nThe functional TLR2-expressing plasmid (YFP-TLR2) was\n\ntransfected into CHO cells by using lipofectamine reagent\n\n(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Briefly CHO cells stably\n\nexpressing full length CR3 or the tail less mutant form of CR3\n\nwere plated in 6 well (2.06106/well) or 24 well (2.06105/well)\nplates and incubated for overnight. The cells were washed,\n\nreplenished with HAMs F12 media without serum, and the\n\nplasmid DNA lipofectamine complex was prepared according to\n\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions and mixed with CHO cells. After\n\n24 hrs of incubation cells were washed and replenished with\n\nHAMs F12 media with serum, incubated for 24 hrs and used for\n\ninfections.\n\nFrancisella infection of hMDMs and CHO cells: uptake and\nassociation assays\n\nF. novicida or Schu S4 was cultured on Chocolate agar plates for\n\n16 hrs and 40 hrs, respectively. Bacteria were re-suspended in\n\nPBS, and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was approximated by\n\nmeasuring the optical density of the bacterial suspension at\n\n600 nm, and confirmed by plating the inocula and counting\n\nCFUs. Bacteria were incubated with hMDM monolayers at an\n\nMOI of 50 in RHH (RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine, 10 mM\n\nHEPES and 0.25% human serum albumin) or RHS (RPMI 1640\n\nwith L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES and serum) with 10%\n\nautologous serum, 10% C3-depleted serum (C3-dpl) or 10% C3-\n\nrepleted serum (C3-rpl) for 15 min on a nutator for equal\n\ndistribution, and then under stationary condition for another\n\n45 min at 37uC, 5% CO2. Following infection, MDMs were\n\nwashed with warm RPMI 1640 and incubated with 50 mg/ml\ngentamycin at 37uC 5%CO2 for 30 min to kill extracellular\nbacteria. MDM monolayers were then washed with PBS, lysed\n\nwith 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and Francisella uptake was\n\nnumerated by serial dilution of the lysates and plated on chocolate\n\nagar plates for CFUs. MDMs were also fixed with 2%\n\nparaformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by\n\nan inside/outside differential staining protocol for attached and\n\ningested bacteria as described below.\n\nFor CHO cell infections, transfected cells in incomplete HAMs\n\nF12 media were incubated with serum-opsonized or non-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 at an MOI of 50. Infections were synchronized\n\nby centrifuging at 4uC, 2506g for 10 min and incubated at 37uC,\n5% CO2 for different time points. At each time point the cells were\n\nwashed and lysed with TN-1 lysis buffer for Western blot or fixed\n\nwith 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature\n\nfollowed by staining for Schu S4 for microscopy studies as\n\ndescribed below.\n\nhMDM infection, lysis and Western blotting\nF. novicida and Schu S4 were prepared as described above.\n\nBefore infection, bacteria were pre-opsonized with 10% autolo-\n\ngous serum, C3-depleted serum or C3-repleted serum at 37uC for\n30 min, washed with ice-cold PBS and re-suspended in ice-cold\n\nPBS. A non-opsonized sample incubated with PBS instead of\n\nserum was also included in all experiments. MDM monolayers\n\nwere washed with warm RPMI 1640, replenished with RHH and\n\npre-chilled at 4uC for 10 min. Opsonized or non-opsonized\nbacteria were added to MDMs, and infections were synchronized\n\nby centrifuging at 4uC, 2506g for 10 min. hMDMs were then\nreturned to 37uC 5% CO2 and incubated for the specified times.\nCells were washed with PBS and lysed with TN-1 lysis buffer\n\n[50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na4P2O7,\n\n10 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM\n\nNa3VO4, and 10 mg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin],\nincubated at 4uC for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 16,0006 g\nat 4uC for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. Protein concentrations\nof the cleared cell lysates were measured using the Pierce BCA-\n\nprotein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Samples were\n\nsubjected to separation by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western\n\nblot with the different antibodies of interest. Protocols for CHO\n\ncell infections, cell lysis and Western blotting were the same.\n\nCytokine ELISAs\nMDMs were infected with F. novicida or Schu S4 without pre-\n\nopsonization in RHH or with RHS plus 10% autologous serum,\n\nC3-depleted serum or C3-repleted serum for 1 h as described\n\nabove. Cell-free culture supernatants were collected at 16 hrs post\n\ninfection.

TIMP-3\nwas initially identified as a potent inhibitor of MMPs, however it also has several properties that\nare unique and not related to its ability to abrogate MMPs. We studied the effects of overex-\npression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) on lung cancer cells and explored\nthe mechanisms involved in apoptosis-induction in susceptible cells and subsequently, the ther-\napeutic effect in vivo. Overexpression of TIMP-3 resulted in apoptosis of A549 lung cancer cells\nand AdCMVTIMP3 up-regulated the expression of p53, Fas ligand, TNFR1 and TNFR2 on these\ncells. Adenoviral delivery of TIMP-3 gene inhibited the growth of pre-established A549 tumours\nin Balb/c nude mice, and was associated with a greater therapeutic effect than either TIMP-1\nor -2 gene delivery. There was no evidence of increased hepatic toxicity following the delivery\nof TIMP-3 either from intra-tumoural or intravenous injection. Thus, at least in cells showing\n\nin vitro susceptibility, TIMP-3 gene therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over TIMPs 1 and\n2. These findings establish the potential of adenoviral gene delivery of TIMP3 as a therapeutic\nagent for selected lung cancers.\n\u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

The understand-\nng of the molecular basis of cancer development and the\nechanisms of the development of metastases has increased\n\nhe potential targets for the development of effective anti-\nancer agents. Gene-based therapies provide an ideal oppor-\nunity to exploit this knowledge as novel therapeutic agents\nor the management of various cancers.\n\nDegradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) occurs\ns cells change their form, migrate or proliferate. Con-\nrolled matrix destruction is considered a key event in both\nocal invasion and the development of metastasis associ-\nted with tumour progression [3]. Matrix metalloproteinases\nMMPs) are zinc dependent endopeptidases that regulate\nhe movement of cells within the ECM and also degrade\nll of its components. They have important roles in tumour\nevelopment and in tumour cell survival [3,4]. MMPs are\nver-expressed in a number of cancers including lung can-\ner. This is associated with increased tumour aggressive-\ness and metastatic potential [3,4]. The intricate balance\netween net extracellular matrix deposition and degrada-\nion is controlled by a complex system of tightly regulated\nrotease enzymes and their endogenous inhibitors, which\nncludes the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)\n5]. It is postulated that inappropriate over-expression of\nMPs or under-expression of TIMPs constitutes part of the\nathogenic mechanism in cancer [6]. Therapies targeted to\nhe processes that inhibit MMP proteolysis and ECM break-\nown may specifically disrupt the growth of tumour without\nltering normal tissues. The increased local expression of\npecific TIMPs, which is achievable with gene delivery may\nrove a more efficient and effective mechanism for the\nnhibition of MMPs. Furthermore, it is now known that cer-\nain TIMPs possess additional properties which may have a\neneficial effect in cancer therapy beyond MMP inhibition\n7].\n\nTIMP-3 has several features that distinguish it from the\nther TIMPs. It binds tightly to the ECM following secre-\nion by the cell [8]. It inhibits vascular endothelial growth\nactor mediated angiogenesis by blocking the binding of\nEGF to VEGF receptor-2, inhibiting downstream signalling\nnd angiogenesis [9]. TIMP-3 also inhibits TNF-\ufffd-converting\nnzyme, a member of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and\netalloproteinase). This may account for its ability to\n\nnduce apoptosis [10]. It has been shown to induce apopto-\nis in a number of cancer cell lines [5,11,12]. It also inhibits\nhedding of ectodomains of cell surface receptors including\nyndecan-1 and -4, L-selectin and IL-6 receptors [10,13\u201415].\nt is plausible that loss of TIMP-3 within tumours may abro-\nate normal apoptotic programs, enhance primary tumour\nrowth and angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastasis and\nossibly therefore contribute to all stages of malignant pro-\nression [7]. Thus, TIMP-3 gene therapy may have significant\ndvantages over other TIMPs.\n\nTo date, less work has been done to evaluate the ther-\npeutic efficiency of TIMP-3 compared to TIMPs-1 and -2.\nrevious work with TIMP-2 gene delivery has shown ther-\n\npeutic effects in animal models, whereas the effects of\nIMP-1 are variable [16]. Further, not all cells lines are sus-\neptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects of TIMP-3 [17].\no direct comparisons of in vivo delivery of TIMP fam-\n\nly members have been reported. In the current study we\n\nv\ns\nw\nm\nu\n\nK.M. Finan et al.\n\netermined the effects of overexpression of adenovirally\nelivered TIMP-3 in susceptible lung cancer cells on prolif-\nration, apoptosis and cell death in vitro, in comparison to\nIMPs-1 and -2. We then determined whether susceptibility\no TIMP-3-induced apoptosis translated to therapeutic gains\nn vivo in over the effects seen to TIMPs-1 and 2.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1.

Balb/c nude mice (4\u20146-week-old) were\nsed in all experiments. For in vivo experiments 1 \u00d7 106 A549\nells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of mice\nnd tumours established a minimum volume of 50\u2014100 mm3.\numour volume was calculated using the equation, vol-\nme = tumour length \u00d7 (tumour width)2/2.

We detected the presence of TIMP-1\nnd -2 in conditioned media from cells transduced by these\niruses, thus confirming the functionality of all elements.\ne then characterised the cell lines with regard to the\n\nevels of expression of coxsackie and adenoviral receptor\nCAR; Fig. 1a), transducibility with an Ad vector carrying\nhe luciferase reporter gene (AdCMVLuc; Fig. 1b) and some\nf the cellular markers known to be involved in the apoptotic\nrocess to see if these parameters would correlate to TIMP-3\nusceptibility. The cell lines showed that there were differ-\nnces in the surface marker expression of Fas, (Fig. 1c),\nhereas TNF-R1 and the death receptor ligand Fas ligand\nxpression was detectable on less than 1% of cells for all\nines (not shown). The levels of intracellular p53 expression\nn each of the cell lines examined varied between each of the\nell lines examined (Fig. 1d). To examine the effects of TIMP-\non the growth of lung cancer cells we studied the adenovi-\n\nal delivery of TIMP-3 on the viability of the lung cancer cell\nines compared to AdCMVLuc and AdCMVTIMP-1 and -2. Using\nanual cell counts and crystal violet staining there was a\n\nignificant decrease in cell numbers in the A549 cell line fol-\nowing infection with AdCMVTIMP-3 at 24 h until 96 h (when\nll cells infected by AdCMVTIMP-3 were dead). There was\no significant effect of adenovirally delivered AdCMVTIMP-1\nr AdCMVTIMP-2 on the growth of A549 cells.

Of these other cell lines only the H1466 line\nhowed a consistent increase in Annexin V and PI, however,\ns noted this did not translate to a consistent net cell killing\nffect.\n\n.3. Bax and Bcl2 expression\n\nrevious studies have shown good correlation between West-\nrn blot (the \u2018\u2018gold standard\u2019\u2019) and flow cytometry for the\netection of these apoptosis related proteins [21]. The ele-\nation of Bax following transduction with AdCMVTIMP3 was\nonsistent with the increased level of apoptosis detected\nn the A549 cells. In the uninfected cells there were\n5.95 \u00b1 2.4% Bax positive cells, while the TIMP-3 treated\nells had 36.95 \u00b1 1.06% positive cells for Bax. AdCMVLuc,\ndCMVTIMP1 and AdCMVTIMP2 demonstrated 21 \u00b1 0.28%,\n2.05 \u00b1 5.02% and 14.14 \u00b1 1.06%, respectively (Fig. 3c). The\nhange in the ratio of the balance between pro-apoptotic\nax and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 indicates increased apoptosis.\nhe balance changed from 0.5 in uninfected cells and 0.49\nn cells infected with AdCMVLuc to 2.0 in cells infected with\ndCMVTIMP3 (Fig. 3d). This is consistent with activation of\nhe caspase apoptotic pathway and a consequent change in\nhe regulators of this pathway from the anti-apoptotic Bcl2\no the pro-apoptotic Bax.\n\nt\nd\nl\np\nd\n\no Bax expression following transduction with AdCMVTIMP-3 and\n\n.4. Cell surface recognition of apoptosis\n\n.4.1. Death receptor and ligand expression\nas, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 are members of the TNF super-\namily of receptors. Specific ligand binding activates death\neceptors and subsequently, the downstream signalling that\nauses cell death. Multiple caspase pathways are recruited\ny activated TNF receptors [22]. TNF-R1 has been shown\no direct its signalling toward either transcription or apop-\nosis [23]. Although TNF-R2 does not have a death recep-\nor domain, it may also have a role in apoptosis through\nNF-R1 [24,25] activation. The expression of TNF-R1 on\nells infected with AdCMVTIMP3 was 3.64 \u00b1 0.67%, com-\nared with 0.21 \u00b1 0.15% in uninfected cells and 0.9 \u00b1 0.5%\nn cells infected with AdCMVLuc. These levels are low\nut there is a significant increase (p < 0.004) following\ndCMVTIMP3 infection (Fig. 4a). The expression of Fas lig-\nnd following AdCMVTIMP3 infection was 4.66 \u00b1 1.07%. In\nninfected cells the expression was 0.62 \u00b1 0.21%, AdCMVLuc\n.31 \u00b1 0.43%, AdCMVTIMP1 0.71 \u00b1 0.22% and AdCMVTIMP2\n.08 \u00b1 0.35%. There is a small but significant increase in\nhe expression of Fas ligand following delivery of TIMP-\n\nto the A549 cells (p < 0.004) (Fig. 4b). Expression of\nNF-R2 on TIMP-3 infected cells was 3.41 \u00b1 0.37%, com-\nared with uninfected controls 1.04 \u00b1 0.05% and AdCMVLuc\niral controls 1.54 \u00b1 0.27%. As anticipated this expres-\nion is low but detectable (Fig. 4c). Metalloproteinases\nave significant role in the regulation of the cytoxicity\nf Fas ligand [26]. Inhibition of MMPs via TIMPs would\ne expected to have significant effects on the activa-\n\nion of the TNFR family and influence the regulation of\niverse cell systems including those involved in cell pro-\niferation [27].

We thus proceeded\nto p53 inhibition studies in an effort to determine whether\nchanges in p53 function were involved in TIMP-3 mediated\napoptosis.\n\n3.5. Inhibitory experiments\n\nWe conducted inhibitory experiments to determine the rel-\native roles of Fas, caspase and p53 in the apoptotic process\ninitiated by TIMP-3. As previously discussed TIMP-3 has been\nshown to act via a Fas death domain dependent Type II\napoptotic pathway in melanoma cells [29]. The caspases are\ncentral to the development of apoptosis initiated by both\nthe intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The demonstration\nof active caspases in cells transfected with TIMP-3 is con-\nsistent with involvement of the caspases in the apoptotic\nprocess initiated by TIMP-3. The addition of the pan-caspase\ninhibitor Z-VAD to the cells infected with TIMP-3 inhibited\nthe development of apoptosis up to 72 h, thus confirming\n\nthe pivotal role of caspases in the TIMP-3 apoptotic process\n(Fig. 5a).\n\nThe Fas inhibitor ZB-4 is a neutralising monoclonal anti-\nbody to Fas receptor that inhibits Fas receptor-mediated\n\nt\ns\ng\ni\n\nf TIMP-3 on A549 cells and (c) the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-\ufffd (p-a)\noes not significantly affect apoptosis induced by TIMP-3.\n\npoptosis. As expected A549 cells developed apoptosis\nollowing infection with TIMP-3 (65.1 \u00b1 2.8% positive for\nnnexin V and PI staining). There was no toxicity associ-\nted with the addition of ZB-4 to uninfected cells compared\no the standard viral control (18.07 \u00b1 3.7% v 14.7 \u00b1 2.7%).\nowever, the addition of ZB-4 to the TIMP-3 treated cells\n\nnhibited the development of apoptosis. Only 17.69 \u00b1 2.5%\nf these cells were positive for Annexin V and PI stain-\nng. This confirms the role of the Fas death receptor in\nhe transformation of the extrinsic apoptotic signal to the\nctivation of DISC and subsequent caspase activation fol-\nowing transduction of A549 cells with adenoviral TIMP-3\nFig. 5b).\n\nThe p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-\ufffd is a reversible inhibitor\nf p53 mediated apoptosis. It improves cell survival after\nenotoxic stresses. The effect of the UV light on the A549\nells was as anticipated. It caused almost 80% of the cells\no become apoptotic. Following the addition of the p53\nnhibitor, the number of cells induced by UV light to undergo\npoptosis was reduced by half. TIMP-3 initiated apoptosis in\n5.1 \u00b1 2.8% of cells and the addition of the p53 inhibitor did\nosis (Fig. 5c). The controls of uninfected and AdCMVLuc\nhowed results consistent with previous findings. This sug-\nests that the p53 pathway is not directly involved in the\nnitiation of apoptosis in A549 cells.\n\n\n\nK.M.

The slightly greater killing effect seen\nwith the conditioned media experiment possibly reflects the\ngreater lead time for TIMP-3 generation in that experiment\n\nFig. 6 (a) Bystander effects of cells infected with\nAdCMVTIMP-3 and mixed with uninfected cells at various\n% of infected cells as indicated.

It is possible that factors released by TIMP-\n-mediated cell death contributed to the net death effect,\nather than TIMP-3 alone, but the key finding was that it is\not necessary to achieve 100% transduction of target cells\no achieve efficient cell death.\n\n.7. AdCMVTIMP3 effect on subcutaneous tumours\nn nude mice\n\nhe effects of adenovirally delivered TIMP-3 were compared\no effects of TIMP-1, -2 and control virus AdCMVLuc. Subcu-\naneous A549 tumours were injected with PBS, AdCMVLuc\nnd AdCMVTIMP1, 2 and 3. Those tumours injected with\ndCMVTIMP3 showed significantly impaired growth when\nompared to PBS, AdCMVLuc, AdCMVTIMP1 or AdCMVTIMP2\nnjected tumours (Fig. 7). On completion of the tumour pro-\nocol at day 35 the animals were euthanised and the tumours\nnd livers extracted for examination. TUNEL analysis of the\numour sections was used to identify apoptotic cells within\nhe sections. Tumours injected with AdCMVTIMP3 had sig-\nificantly more apoptotic cells than tumours injected with\nBS, AdCMVLuc and either TIMP-1 or -2 (Fig. 8-1(a\u2014e)). H&E\ntaining and TUNEL assay was used to assess inflammation\nr apoptosis in the livers of animals given tail vein injec-\nions of adenoviral vectors. There were no significant dif-\nerences between the livers of those animals injected with\ndCMVTIMP3 and control animals. Serological examination\nf hepatic enzymes showed that there was no significant\nvidence of hepatic derangement in any of the groups.\n\n.8.

Our vector val-\nidation studies had shown that TIMP-3 was detectable in\nthe cell-matrix rather than freely in conditioned media.\nWe used two methods to determine the bystander effect\nof TIMP-3. Firstly, we infected cells then 24 h later (before\nsigns of toxicity) mixed these at various ratios with unin-\nfected cells. Secondly, we infected cells, then waited 72 h\n(at which time toxicity was apparent) then took the con-\nditioned medium from these and applied it to uninfected\ncells. We used standard cell counting techniques to deter-\nmine cell numbers on completion of the protocol. The mixed\ncultures containing the TIMP-3 infected cells were signifi-\ncantly affected by the presence of TIMP-3 transduced cells.\nIn fact almost all the cells were dead in all ratios examined\n(Fig. 6a). The addition of media containing 15% and 35% of\nthe TIMP-3 conditioned media resulted in the death of all\nthe uninfected cells.

Discussion\n\nThe development of cancer therapeutics based on modula-\ntion of MMP activity is a rational paradigm but as yet it has\nfailed to achieve significant meaningful clinical advances.\nGene-based approaches for MMP inhibition using TIMPs may\nhave several advantages over conventional pharmaceuti-\ncal approaches. The potential for high-level locoregional\nexpression of the therapeutic agent and the anti-tumour\nproperties of the TIMPs beyond MMP inhibition offer the\npotential of multifaceted therapeutic agents. A number of\ndisturbances in the TIMP/MMP relative ratios have been\n\ndescribed in lung cancer [30]. High levels of MMP expres-\nsion are found in non-small cell carcinoma [31]. The number\nof MMPs expressed tends to increase with increased tumour\nstage and the levels of individual MMPs tends to be higher\nwith advanced tumour stage [30]. Decreased TIMP-3 expres-\n\n(\n(\n[\na\na\n\nVTIMP-2 and (e) AdCMVTIMP-3. 3(a\u2014e) CD-31 expression within\nontrol, (b) PBS, (c) AdCMVTIMP-1, (d) AdCMVTIMP-2 and (e)\n\nion at the invasive front of human colon carcinomas sug-\nests that a regional loss of TIMP-3 may facilitate tumour\nnvasion and metastasis [14]. The delivery of TIMP-3 to can-\ner cells would allow restoration of the MMP/TIMP balance\nnd inhibit the effects of excessive MMP expression. TIMP-3\nelivery would offer other potential benefits independent\nf MMP inhibition such as the initiation of apoptosis and cell\neath in lung cancer cells, and the inhibition of angiogene-\nis.\n\nThe evaluation of TIMPs with respect to their role in can-\ner has lead to potentially conflicting results [16]. TIMP-1\nas been associated with increased survival of lymphoma\nell lines. It also has been shown to confer resistance to Fas\nigand dependent and independent apoptosis [32]. TIMP-2\nas been shown to promote apoptosis in an in vivo colorec-\nal cancer model [33], but, protects B16 melanoma cells\nrom apoptosis [34]. TIMP-4 can also instigate apoptosis\nn transformed cardiac fibroblasts but inhibits apoptosis in\numan breast cancer cells in vitro and mammary tumours\nn vivo [35]. Baker et al. [5] have previously demonstrated\nhat adenoviral gene delivery of TIMP-3 to melanoma cells\nnd vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo inhibits invasion\nnd induces apoptosis. The same group also demonstrated\nhat gene delivery of TIMP-3 inhibited the invasion of HeLa\n\nmoderately invasive cervical carcinoma cells) and HT1080\nfibrosarcoma cells) through artificial basement membranes\n18]. This phenomenon was also demonstrated by TIMPs 1\nnd 2 whereas the pro-apoptotic effect of TIMP-3 was unique\nnd was therefore the focus of the current study.

Questions of toxicity in normal organs, due\no the use of adenoviral vectors to deliver TIMP-3 have\not been addressed previously. We attempted to examine\nhis.\n\nTIMPs are known to have divergent effects on pro-\nrammed cell death [5], and the current series of investi-\nations demonstrates for the first time the ability of TIMP-3\nelivered via an adenoviral vector to induce apoptosis and\nell death in vitro in lung cancer cells. We have shown that\nverexpression of AdCMVTIMP3 effectively induces apoptosis\nnd causes cell death within 96 h of its delivery to A549 lung\nancer cell lines. This effect is not seen with either TIMP-1 or\n2. However, we found that the effect of TIMP-3-induced cell\nilling in vitro was rather limited, given that most of the cell\nines we tested were resistant to this effect. We attempted\no determine the basis for the variable susceptibility by look-\nng at levels of expression of various components of the\npoptosis pathway, as well as differences in the basic sus-\neptibility of the lines to infection with Ad, but no consistent\nifferences emerged. While we assessed death receptor lev-\nls and p53 levels, a more detailed analysis of functional\n53 status could provide more insight. Of note, A549 cells\nre known to have functional p53 [28]. Nevertheless, we did\not find any impact on TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis by p53\nnhibition. Variability in the susceptibility of tumour lines to\nIMP-3 has been noted by others [17]. Thus, for clinical util-\n\nty, some method for identifying those tumours likely to be\nusceptible would be preferable for optimal application of\nhis treatment strategy.\n\nMitochondria and cell surface receptors mediate the two\nain pathways of apoptosis [36]. The death receptors trans-\nuce the pro-apoptotic signal from the extracellular space\no the intracellular environment. Fas and TNF-R1 members\nf the TNF superfamily are among the best characterised\nf the death receptors [37,38]. Fas ligand is also a mem-\ner of the TNF family and is the principle ligand for Fas\n39]. The binding of Fas ligand to the receptor allows the\normation of death inducing signalling complex (DISC) by\nnducing clustering of Fas associated death domain (FADD),\naspase-8 and caspase-10. This results in proteolytic cleav-\nge of these caspases, release of the active proteases and\nubsequent activation of the downstream effector caspases\n37]. TNF-R2 does not contain a death domain motif but is\nhought to be able to signal apoptosis directly or through\nigand passing to TNF-R1 [40,41]. Exposure of metastatic\nelanoma cell lines to TIMP-3 results in stabilisation of\n\nhree distinct death receptors, TNF-R1, Fas and TRAIL-R1\nn cell surface and makes these cells more susceptible to\npoptosis induced by their respective ligands [14,42]. We\nave shown that treatment of A549 lung cancer cells, which\nave abundant expression of the Fas death receptor, with\n\nIMP-3 up-regulates the presence of Fas ligand, TNF-R1 and\nNF-R2 on the cell surface consistent with the significant\npoptosis induced by the delivery of TIMP-3 to these cells.\nimilar treatments with AdCMVTIMP1 and AdCMVTIMP2 did\not induce these changes.\n\ni\nF\ni\no\no\n\nK.M. Finan et al.\n\nA number of pharmaceutical inhibitors of MMPs (MMPIs)\nave been developed. Preclinical studies in experimen-\nal animal model systems demonstrated significant benefits\nrom the delivery of MMPIs in the form of reduced num-\ner of metastases and prolonged survival [43,44], although\nhese results have not yet translated to consistent benefits\nn human clinical trials. Importantly, we have shown that\nhe promising anti-tumour effects of TIMP-3 gene delivery\nn vitro can be translated into a therapeutic effect in vivo,\nor susceptible cells. Delivery of intra-tumoural AdCMVTIMP-\ninhibits the growth of pre-established subcutaneous A549\n\numours in Balb/c nude mice and this reduction in growth\ns related to an increase in apoptosis within these tumours.\nhere was no increase in toxicity as determined by both his-\nological examination of livers and examination of hepatic\nnzymes. Concurrent analysis of Balb/c nude mice treated\nith AdCMVTIMP-1 and -2 did not show evidence of a reduc-\n\nion in growth.\nThe anti-angiogenic effects of the TIMPs were initially\n\nostulated to be due to their MMP inhibitory abilities. How-\nver, it has been shown that each of the TIMPs 1\u20143 have\nMP independent mechanisms for inhibiting angiogenesis.\nIMP-1 has an influence on tumour progression through MMP\n\nnhibition, specifically MMP-9, and also by impairing angio-\nenesis thus restricting tumour growth and progression. It\nas also been shown to inhibit microvascular cell migra-\nion thus having a negative impact on tumour angiogene-\nis [45\u201448]. TIMP-2 has been shown to specifically inhibit\nngiogenesis via induction of MKP-1 leading to p38 MAPK\nathway inactivation [49]. TIMP-2 also inhibits the mito-\nenic response of human microvascular endothelial cells to\nrowth factors [50]. There has also been significant inves-\nigation into the mechanisms of TIMP-3 induced inhibition\nf angiogenesis. There is an effect exerted via MMP inhibi-\nion which could potentially lead to a positive or negative\nffect on angiogenesis. However, there is a net negative\nffect seen in the presence of TIMP-3 overexpression in both\nn vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro effects of\nIMP-3 on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and EC\nube formation have been documented by Anand-Apte et\nl. during their investigation into the role of TIMP-3 muta-\nions in the development of Sorsby\u2019s fundal dystrophy [51].\nt was demonstrated that TIMP-3 inhibited the chemotaxis\nf vascular endothelial cells toward vascular endothelial\nrowth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor\nbFGF) and inhibited the invasion of collagen gels, capil-\nary morphogenesis in vitro and also inhibited bFGF induced\nngiogenesis. Spurbeck et al. [52] demonstrated that retro-\niral gene delivery of TIMP-3 to murine neuroblastoma and\nelanoma tumour cells in vivo affected functional capillary\norphogenesis. In this model the endothelial cells did not\n\norm functional tubules. There was decreased expression\nf vascular endothelial (VE)\u2014cadherin by endothelial cells\nn the presence of TIMP-3. Further, the work of Qi et al.\n9] demonstrated that the ability of TIMP-3 to inhibit VEGF\nediated angiogenesis was mediated via the inhibition of\n\nhe binding of VEGF to VEGF receptor-2 and the subsequent\n\nnhibition of the downstream signalling and angiogenesis.\nurther investigations in animal studies have shown there\ns a decrease in vascular endothelial-cadherin expression\nn endothelial cells in the presence of increased levels\nf TIMP-3. This supports the concept that TIMP-3 overex-\n\n\n\ngen\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\nIn vitro susceptibility to the pro-apoptotic effects of TIMP-3\n\npression leads to failure of vascular integrity in tumours\n[52].\n\nAt present, TIMP-3 is emerging as the most attractive\nanti-tumour agent. It has shown promise in animal models of\nmalignant glioma and human leukaemia xenografts in mice\n[17,53]. It inhibits MMPs effectively, induces apoptosis in\ntumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis [5,18,54]. It is bound\nto the extracellular matrix and its ability to induce an effect\nbeyond the transduced cell is directly related to its local-\nisation here [55]. Clearly however, the therapeutic utility\nof TIMP-3 will not be universal, but for those tumours sus-\nceptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects, therapeutic gains\ncan be achieved over alternate TIMPs. Further vector devel-\nopment to enhance efficacy might increase the therapeutic\nvalue of this promising agent but better understanding of\nthe molecular basis of TIMP-3 susceptibility would help to\nbetter target this therapeutic approach.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFinancial support: Grants from the Cancer Council of\nAustralia, Australian Lung Foundation, Medical Research\nand Compensation Foundation, National Health and Medi-\ncal Research Council and the University of Adelaide.

CPCs marker c-kit and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), are linked as c-kit/SCF axis, which is\nassociated with the functions of proliferation and differentiation. In our previous study, we found that stromal cell-derived\nfactor-1a (SDF-1a) could enhance the expression of c-kit. However, the mechanism is unknown.\n\nMethods and Results: CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts, c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs were separated by magnetic\nbeads. The cells were cultured with SDF-1a and CXCR4-selective antagonist AMD3100, and c-kit expression was measured\nby qPCR and Western blotting. Results showed that SDF-1a could enhance c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs, made c-\nkit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, and AMD3100 could inhibit the function of SDF-1a. After the intervention of SDF-1a and\nAMD3100, proliferation and migration of CPCs were measured by CCK-8 and transwell assay. Results showed that SDF-1a\ncould enhance the proliferation and migration of both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs, and AMD3100 could inhibit these\nfunctions. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA were measured by qPCR, DNMT activity was measured using the DNMT\nactivity assay kit, and DNA methylation was analyzed using Sequenom\u2019s MassARRAY platform, after the CPCs were cultured\nwith SDF-1a. The results showed that SDF-1a stimulation inhibited the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, which are critical\nfor the maintenance of regional DNA methylation. Global DNMT activity was also inhibited by SDF-1a. Lastly, SDF-1a\ntreatment led to significant demethylation in both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs.\n\nConclusions: SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs\nexpressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the inhibition of DNMT1\nand DNMT3b expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene.\n\nCitation: Chen Z, Pan X, Yao Y, Yan F, Chen L, et al.

In 2003, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) were first\n\nreported to reside in the adult heart [1\u20133]. Resident CPCs may\n\nbe particularly suitble for resurrecting dead myocardium because\n\nthey are endogenous components of the adult heart and appear to\n\nbe respnsible for the physiological and pathological turnover of\n\ncardiac myocytes and other cardiac cells. The heart have several\n\npopulations of CPCs, which are self-renewing, clonogenic, multi-\n\npotent and have the ability to proliferate and differentiate into\n\nfunctional cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and other kinds of\n\ncells [2,4\u20136]. Among these CPCs, c-kit(+)CPCs are especially\nsuitable in cell therapy for the recovery of injured cardiomyocytes\n\n[2,4]. c-kit(+)CPCs have the larger numbers than other types of\nCPCs, and have stronger proliferation and differentiation ability to\n\nrepair the injured myocardium [7].\n\nc-kit is a proto-oncogene and a tyrosine kinase growth factor\n\nreceptor, expressed on several types of cells, including CPCs [8\u2013\n\n11], with the stem cell factor (SCF) as its ligand. c-kit expression is\n\nrelated to the regulation of cell proliferation, and migration [12\u2013\n\n15]. Stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) is a member of the\nCXC chemokine family, and CXCR4 is its receptor, which are\n\nexpressed in a variety of cell types, including CPCs [16]. SDF-1a\nexpression has been reported to increase after an acute myocardial\n\ninfarction [17]. SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could prompt stem cell\nhoming to damaged cardiac tissue [16,18]. AMD3100 is a specific\n\nantagonist to SDF-1a, which binds to CXCR4 competitively for\npreventing the combination of SDF-1a and CXCR4. Recent\nstudies have indicated that SDF-1a/CXCR4 and c-kit/SCF axes\nare closely linked [19]. Our study found that SDF-1a could\nenhance c-kit expression. However, limited information is known\n\non the regulation of SDF-1a on c-kit.\nDNA methylation is one of the important research content of\n\nepigenetics, which cytosine is methylated in a reaction catalyzed\n\nby DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), with S-adenosyl methionine\n\n(SAM) as a methyl donor [20]. In mammalian cells, three\n\nDNMTs, namely, DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, are\nresponsible for DNA methylation. DNMT1 is a maintenance\n\ntype methyltransferase, responsible for copying DNA methylation\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69134\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0069134&domain=pdf\n\n\npatterns during DNA replication, whereas DNMT3a and\nDNMT3b are essential for de novo methylation [20\u201325]. DNA\nmethylation is an important method in the regulatory mechanisms\n\nof gene expression [20\u201329]. In several diseases such as cancer,\n\ngene promoter CpG islands result in abnormal silencing [27\u201329].\n\nA recent study has found that TGFb1 could regulate CD133\nexpression through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b\nexpressions, and subsequently, the demethylation of promoter-1\n\n[30]. However, the influence of SDF-1a on the expression of c-kit\nby DNA methylation is unknown.\n\nThe present study demonstrates that SDF-1a combined with\nCXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and\nmake c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs\n\nproliferation and migration ability improvement, through the\n\ninhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and global\nDNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-\n\nkit gene.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics Statement\nAll animal studies were carried out using a method approved\n\nby the the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of the\n\nSoutheast University, and conform with the guidelines of the\n\nNational Research Council (approval ID: SYXK-2010.3908).\n\nIsolation and culture of CPCs\nFor the isolation and culture of CPCs in our laboratory [31],\n\nCPCs were acquired from the hearts of two-month-old wild-type\n\nmale C57BL/6 mice (Yangzhou Laboratory Animal Center).\n\nThe hearts were acquired using a method approved by the Care\n\nof Experimental Animals Committee of the Southeast University,\n\nNanjing, China (Laboratory Animal Center of Southeast\n\nUniversity). CPCs were isolated following the standard method\n\ndescribed previously. After one or two weeks of growth, a layer\n\nof fibroblast-like cells were generated from the adherent\n\nmyocardial tissue. On these fibroblast-like cells, several small,\n\nround, and phase-bright cells emerged, which were collected by\n\nthe digestion of accutase enzyme, which did not affect the cell\n\nsurface markers (at room temperature, under direct visualization,\n\nfor a maximum of 3 min). The obtained cells were separated by\n\nmagnetic-activated c-kit cell sorting magnetic beads (Miltenyi\n\nBiotec Inc., GER) following the instructions of the manufactur-\n\ners.

CPCs were\n\nthen divided into two groups, namely, control and SDF-1a groups.\nGenomic DNA was extracted and subjected to Bisulfite sequencing\n\nanalysis. We found that SDF-1a could significantly reduce the\nmethylation percentage of c-kit(+)CPCs in five out of seven, and all\nof seven for c-kit(2)CPCs, analyzed CpG sites after incubation.\n\n(Figures 5A and 5B).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe key findings in our study are listed as follows: (1) An\n\nadequate amount of CPCs could be obtained from adult mouse\n\nheart tissue using enzymatic digestion, and c-kit(+)CPCs and c-\nkit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting,\n\n(2) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit\nexpression of c-kit(+) CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing\nc-kit, this regulation could be suppressed by ADM3100, an\n\ninhibitor of SDF-1a, (3) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could\nenhance the proliferation and migration abilities of CPCs, and\n\nthese fuctions could be suppressed by AMD3100, (4)SDF-1a\ncombined with CXCR4 could up-regulated c-kit expression\n\nthrough the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression\nand global DNMT activity, as well as through subsequent\n\ndemethylation of the c-kit gene.\n\nIn regenerating the functional cardiac tissue, stem cell therapy is\n\nan effective method for the recovery of the injured myocardium.\n\nWe selected CPCs because of their incomparable cardiac\n\nregenerative capacity [33\u201334]. Presently, CPCs are based exclu-\n\nsively on the expression of a stem cell-related surface antigen,\n\nnamely, c-kit and Sca-1. CPCs are multipotent, self-renewing, and\n\nclonogenic, which have the ability to transform cardiomyocytes in\n\nnormal, as well as in aging and diseased hearts. CPCs apparently\n\nhave a mixture of different subpopulations. Among these CPCs, c-\n\nkit(+)CPCs showed better cardiac repair capability thus are\nconsidered as the most suitable cells for myocardial regeneration\n\ntherapies [35]. Hence, in this study, we selected the marker, c-kit,\n\nas the identification index of CPCs, as observed in the heart. Our\n\nstudy verified that, an adequate amount of CPCs could be\n\nacquired from an adult mouse heart through enzymatic digestion,\n\nc-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic-\nactivated cell sorting. CPCs within 10 generations, which we had\n\nactually examined for c-kit expression, were used for these\n\nexperiments. Researches showed that c-kit (+)CPCs could be\npassaged to the 40 generation, and still had kept the stem cell\n\nsurface markers [36].\n\nc-kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase factor receptor. Its\n\nligand, SCF, is an early hemopoietic growth factor. c-kit/SCF axis\n\nsupports the proliferation and migration of multiple hemopoietic\n\nlineages [37\u201339]. SDF-1a belongs to the CXC subfamily, which\nhas the ability to facilitate the transmigration of hematopoietic\n\ncells through endothelial cell barriers [40]. CXCR4 is its receptor,\n\na seven- transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. SDF-1a\nexpression is aimed to protect against myocardial ischemic injury\n\n[41], which is critical in progenitor cell tissue retention, trafficking,\n\nand homing [42]. SDF-1a expression has been shown to enhance\nthe survival of progenitor cells in several stimuli such as in\n\nischemia/reperfusion injury [43\u201344], serum withdrawal and\n\napoptotic cell death, through interaction with CXCR4 [45].\n\nAMD3100 is a specific antagonist to SDF-1a, which competitively\nbinds to CXCR4 to prevent the combination of SDF-1a and\nCXCR4, effectively blocking.90% of binding SDF-1a [46]. A\nrecent study showed that AMD3100 with the concentration of\n\n5 mg/ml could efficiently prevent the SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis [47].\nIn our study, we found that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could\n\nup-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-\nkit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation\n\nand migration abilities improvement. Research showed\n\nVEGFMSCs could induced SDF-1a and CXCR4 expression,\nand promoted CSCs proliferation and migration, whereas\n\nblockade of SDF-1a or its receptor CXCR4 by RNAi or\nantagonist significantly diminished these beneficial effects of\n\nVEGFMSCs [48]. Our results were similar to these results, and\n\nthe conclusion was that SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could affect CSCs\nproliferation and migration. However, the mechanism is not quite\n\nclear.\n\nDNA methylation is an important mechanism for gene\n\ntranscriptional silencing. CpG hypermethylation in DNA pro-\n\nmoter regions is responsible for gene silencing [49\u201351]. DNA\n\nmethylation status was regulated by DNMT, which has de novo\n\nmethylation activity. We found that SDF-1a combined with\nCXCR4 could inhibit global DNMT activity. Furthermore,\n\nDNMT expression, include DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b,\nwas significantly higher in c-kit(2)CPCs compared to c-\n\nkit(+)CPCs, and DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was\nsuppressed by the stimulation of SDF-1a combined with\nCXCR4. Therefore, DNMT1 and DNMT3b are critical\nenzymes in the mechanism of SDF-1a combined with CXCR4\ninduced c-kit expression. Meanwhile, Bisulfite sequencing anal-\n\nysis was chosen to quantify the promoter methylation degree in\n\nmultiple CpG sites. Our data demonstrated that SDF-1a\nsignificantly reduces c-kit promoter methylation of c-kit(+)CPCs\nin five out of seven CpG sites, and all of seven CpG sites for c-\n\nkit(2)CPCs. Therefore, the 7th and 15th CpG sites probably\n\nplay an important role in the expression of c-kit gene in c-\n\nkit(2)CPCs. Although the effect of SDF-1a on methylation in\nindividual CpG sites is relatively small, the overall effect of\n\naccumulated demethylation induced by SDF-1a in multiple CpG\nsites has significant influence on c-kit transcription. Therefore,\n\nSDF-1a induced demethylation in the c-kit promoter is\nimportant in the regulation of c-kit transcription.\n\nOur study demonstrated that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4\ncould regulate c-kit expression, which result in the CPCs\n\nproliferation and migration ability improvement, and this function\n\ncould be suppressed by ADM3100. Furthermore, the up-\n\nregulation of c-kit expression by SDF-1a combined with CXCR4\nis through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression\nand the global DNMTs activity, as well as through the subsequent\n\ndemethylation of the c-kit gene. In summary, this study described\n\na mechanism by which SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 regulates\nc-kit expression through promoter demethylation. However, no\n\nclue about the mechanism of the inhibiting effect of SDF-1a\ncombined with CXCR4 to DNMT was found so far. We will\n\ncontinue to search for the possible mechanism. Our current\n\nfindings provided a novel strategy for stem cell therapy in\n\nrecovering damaged myocardium through the modification of the\n\nstatus of c-kit promoter methylation by potentially targeting SDF-\n\n1a or DNMTs.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Yao Liang Tang for his valuable technical\n\nassistance.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: ZC GM.

This analysis, followed by functional\ncharacterization, resulted in the identification of Jumonji Domain Containing 6 (JMJD6) protein as a novel driver of\noncogenic properties in breast cancer.\n\nMethods: Through microarray informatics, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the correlation\nbetween gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients in 14 independent breast cancer\ncohorts. JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate gene robustly associated with poor patient survival.\nImmunohistochemistry, siRNA-mediated silencing, and forced overexpression of JMJD6 in cell-based assays\nelucidated molecular mechanisms of JMJD6 action in breast cancer progression and shed light on the clinical\nbreast cancer subtypes relevant to JMJD6 action.\n\nResults: JMJD6 was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse outcomes, including ER- and basal-like,\nClaudin-low, Her2-enriched, and ER+ Luminal B tumors. High nuclear JMJD6 protein was associated with ER negativity,\nadvanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue microarrays. Separation of ER+/LN- patients that received endocrine\nmonotherapy indicated that JMJD6 is predictive of poor outcome in treatment-specific subgroups. In breast cancer cell\nlines, loss of JMJD6 consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not apoptosis, whereas forced stable\noverexpression increased growth. In addition, knockdown of JMJD6 in invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB231,\ndecreased motility and invasion, whereas overexpression in MCF-7 cells slightly promoted motility but did not confer\ninvasive growth. Microarray analysis showed that the most significant transcriptional changes occurred in cell-\nproliferation genes and genes of the TGF-b tumor-suppressor pathway. High proliferation was characterized by\nconstitutively high cyclin E protein levels. The inverse relation of JMJD6 expression with TGF-b2 could be extrapolated to\nthe breast cancer cohorts, suggesting that JMJD6 may affect similar pathways in primary breast cancer.\n\nConclusions: JMJD6 is a novel biomarker of tumor aggressiveness with functional implications in breast cancer\ngrowth and migration.\n\nIntroduction\nIn breast cancer, resistance to standard-of-care systemic\nadjuvant treatments such as endocrine and chemothera-\npies remains a major health burden and prompts the\nneed for novel therapeutic targets for patients with\n\nadvanced, unresponsive, or relapsed disease. We pre-\nviously used gene-expression profiles of breast tumors to\nidentify extracellular/secretory proteins and cell surface-\nreceptor genes whose high expression levels associate\nwith poor clinical end points. For example, we recently\nidentified serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1)\nas an important therapeutic target in breast cancer by\nusing a combined genotype and phenotype screening\napproach. We found that inhibition of SPINK1 by\n\n* Correspondence: kd1@nibmg.ac.in\n8National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, 2nd Floor Netaji Subash\nSanatorium, Kalyani 741251, India\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nLee et al.

A second candidate identified in the\nsame study was the phosphatidylserine receptor (PTDSR).\nFormerly, PTDSR was thought to be a cell-surface\n\nprotein that facilitates recruitment of phagocytic cells to\nsites of apoptosis. Antibodies against PTDSR and\nannexin V have been used in combination to estimate\napoptosis [2]. Mouse knockouts of PTDSR showed early\npostnatal lethality and had growth retardation and mul-\ntiple developmental abnormalities due to insufficient dif-\nferentiation during embryogenesis; however, no defect in\napoptotic clearance of cells was evident [3]. By genera-\ntion of deletion mutants and immune localization, Cui\net al. [4] demonstrated that PTDSR is a nuclear protein,\nwith five nuclear localization signals scattered through-\nout its sequence. Later, PTDSR was renamed Jumonji\ndomain containing 6 (JMJD6) based on the presence of\nits JMJC domain with bifunctional histone arginine\ndemethylation and lysyl oxidase activity [4-6]. JMJD6 is\nhomologous to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) aspar-\naginyl-hydroxylase, suggesting a function in cellular\nresponse to hypoxia. In addition, JMJD6 protein was\nrecently shown to interact with splicing factor U2AF65;\nhowever, very few splicing events in a limited number of\ngenes were attributable to JMJD6 expression [6]. In\nendothelial cells, alternate splicing of VEGF receptor\n(Flt1) by U2AF65 promoted endothelial cell migration,\nand siRNA-mediated knockdown of JMJD6 in endothe-\nlial cells led to decreased migration [7]. Based on X-ray\ncrystallographic data, it was predicted and shown that\napart from its enzymatic activity, JMJD6 protein bound\nsingle-stranded RNA [8]. These diverse findings predict\na range of versatile functions for JMJD6, at the tran-\nscriptional, splicing, posttranscriptional, and biochemical\nlevels. However, very little is known about the role of\nJMJD6 in cancer and the molecular pathways that may\nimpinge on disease initiation and prognosis.\nBecause our in silico analysis demonstrated a robust\n\npositive association between JMJD6 expression and\nbreast cancer recurrence, we investigated its phenotypic\nand molecular effects in breast cancer cells. We report\nherein that perturbation of JMJD6 expression modulates\ncell proliferation and cell scattering and motility: pheno-\ntypes associated with cancer metastasis. Furthermore,\nour findings suggest that these cellular phenotypes may\nbe elicited by JMJD6-mediated suppression of trans-\nforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-b2) and/or activa-\ntion of proteins that potentiate cell division in a cell\ntype-specific manner. These in vitro mechanistic find-\nings are consistent with the clinical observations that\nJMJD6 expression correlates positively with proliferation\nindex and high histologic grade but inversely with TGF-\nb2 expression. Together, these data implicate JMJD6\n\nfunction in breast tumor progression and suggest a diag-\nnostic role for JMJD6 in predicting patient outcomes.\n\nMaterials and methods\nBreast cancer clinical datasets\nTumor-expression profiles were obtained with approval\nfrom and in accordance with the policies of the institu-\ntional review boards of the respective institutions. An\nintegrated \u201cSuper Cohort\u201d (SC) of 15 individual Affyme-\ntrix array datasets comprising 2,116 breast cancer\npatients was used in this analysis. These datasets were\npreviously described in detail in Soon et al. [1]. These\ncohorts were accessible from public databases, Gene\nExpression Omnibus (National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation, Bethesda, MD, USA), ArrayExpress (Eur-\nopean Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK), and caAr-\nray (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Atlanta, GA, USA).\nAppropriate permission has been granted for the use of\nthe datasets and corresponding de-identified clinical\ndata. A summary of the clinical dataset details and lit-\nerature references can be found in Additional file 1,\nTable S1. Initial discovery and meta-analysis was per-\nformed on a subset of this Super Cohort.\nAll raw data (CEL files) were preprocessed and nor-\n\nmalized by using the R software package [9], and library\nfiles provided via the Bioconductor [10]. Raw data were\nMAS5.0 normalized on a per-cohort basis by using the\njustMAS function in the simpleaffy library from Biocon-\nductor (no background correction, target intensity of\n600). Cross-cohort batch effects were corrected by using\nthe COMBAT empirical Bayes method [11]. Normalized\nJMJD6 probesets, 212722_s_at and 212723_at, were\naveraged for the analysis of data from Affymetrix U133\narrays, and JMJD6 probe, AB011157, was used for the\nanalysis of the Agilent array dataset (that is, the NKI\ndataset). Of 2,116 array profiles in the Super Cohort,\n1,954 patient cases are annotated with distant metasta-\nsis-free survival (DMFS) time and event information.\n\nClinical survival analysis and expression in subtypes\nDistant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was used as the\nclinical end point of interest. A DMFS event was defined\nas metastatic recurrence to a distant organ site or in a\nlimited number of cases, as death owing to progressive\nbreast cancer. Cox proportional hazard regression analy-\nsis of JMJD6 expression with DMFS data (Time and\nEvent) was performed in individual patient datasets and\nin the Super Cohort. Clinical subtype analysis was per-\nformed by using the Super Cohort. Intrinsic subtypes\nwere assigned via the PAM50 algorithm of Parker et al.\n[12], by using the code provided by the authors at UNC\nMicroarray Database [13]. Gene data were matched by\nsymbol and median centered, and Spearman correlation\nwas used to assign samples to the nearest PAM50\n\nLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85\n\nPage 2 of 16\n\n\n\ncentroid. Claudin-Low subtypes were assigned based on\nthe method described by Prat et al. [14], by using the\nmicroarray data (GSE18229) and information provided\nby the authors at UNC Microarray Database [13]. Clau-\ndin-Low and Normal centroids were generated, and\nsamples were assigned to one or the other class based\non euclidean distance to the class centroid. The PAM50\nand Claudin-Low subtype information was then com-\nbined with the PAM50 subtype used, unless a sample\nhad been classified as Claudin-Low, in which case, the\nClaudin-Low assignment would take precedence.\nDistribution of JMJD6 expression in various breast\n\ncancer subtypes was analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks and\nmultiple pairwise comparisons with the Dunn method\nby using Sigma Plot. Statistical significance of differen-\ntial JMJD6 expression in ER-positive versus ER-negative\ntumors was analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney Rank\nSum Test. In Kaplan-Meier and CoxPH survival analysis\nof JMJD6 expression cohorts in the clinical subtypes, the\npatients were separated by median expression across the\nSuper Cohort into high and low JMJD6-expression\ngroups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also was per-\nformed on patient groups ranked by quartile expression\nwithin each clinical subtype. All survival analyses were\nperformed by using Sigma Plot [15].\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue microarray (TMA) blocks containing cores from\n98 breast cancer patients were constructed, as described\npreviously, under institutional ethics committee approval\nwith consent for the tissue microarray program (NUS-\nIRB 05-017) [1,16,17] and used for the analysis. Anti-\nJMJD6 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz,\nCA, USA: Sc-28348) was used at a dilution of 1:50 along\nwith antigen retrieval by heat and Tris-EDTA (pH 9.1).\nAutomated IHC scoring was performed with the Ariol\nSL-50 image analysis system (Applied Imaging, Santa\nClara, CA, USA). Positivity of JMJD6 nuclear expression\nwas defined as nuclear-staining intensity and percentage\ncoverage scores \u226525%. Odds-ratio analysis was per-\nformed on JMJD6-positive expression and clinicopatho-\nlogic features of the tumors by using PASW Statistics\n18 [18].\n\nCell lines\nAll cell lines were obtained from American Type Cul-\nture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in growth\nmedia, at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The growth medium for\nMCF-7, CAMA-1, and BT-549 was Dulbecco Modified\nEagle Medium (DMEM), with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS); and for MDA-MB231 and T47D, it was RPMI-\n1640, with 10% FBS.\n\nCloning and expression of JMJD6\nJMJD6 (NM_001081461.1) (J1) was amplified by using\nMCF-7 mRNA (forward primer: 5\u2019CCCAAGCTTAT-\nGAACCACAAGAGCAAGAAG3\u2019; reverse primer: 5\u2019\nGCTCTAGATCACCTGGAGGAGCTGCG 3\u2019), followed\nby reamplification with forward primer: 5\u2019 GAGGTAC-\nCATGAACCACAAGAGCA 3\u2019 and reverse primer: 5\u2019\nCGCTCGAGTGGGGGTGAGCCCGGCCT 3\u2019 and\nligated into TOPO pCR2.1 vector. All clones were\nsequence verified. JMJD6 was cloned from TOPO vec-\ntors into a gateway entry vector pENTR3C (Invitrogen)\nand then recombined into the lentivirus vector\npLenti6.2/V5-DEST (Invitrogen), pLenti4/V5-Dest (Invi-\ntrogen), and pcDNA3.1/V5-Dest (Invitrogen) by LR\nrecombination, according to the manufacturer\u2019s proto-\ncol. For lentiviral clones, pLenti6.2/V5-DEST or\npLenti4/V5-Dest was co-transfected with packaging vec-\ntors (Invitrogen) into 293 FT cells, and the supernatant\nwas harvested approximately 48 hours for packaged len-\ntivirus. For infection of MCF-7 cells, the cells were pla-\nted at 50% confluence and incubated with 20 \u03bcl to 30 \u03bcl\nof the concentrated virus and 8 \u03bcg/ml of hexamethrine\nbromide (Polybrene) for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. The cells\nwere replated and cultured with Zeocin (Invitrogen) to\nobtain several clones (MCF7-J1-OE). The pcDNA3.1\nvector was used to generate JMJD6 expression clones by\ntransfection by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)\ninto MDA-MB231, T47D, and CAMA cell lines. Stable\nclones were selected with gentamycin (Gibco).\n\nKnockdown of JMJD6 gene\nSiRNA was reverse transfected (by using manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into\nthe cell lines. At 48 hours after transfection, the cells\nwere reconstituted in fresh media for experimental\nassays. JMJD6 siRNAs used were as follows: siRNA A\n(Ambion: 111915)- gcuauggugaacacccuaatt; siRNA B\n(Dharmacon: D-010363-01)- gaacugggauucacaucga;\nsiRNA C (Dharmacon: D-010363-02)- ggauaacgauggcua-\ncuca; and siRNA D (Dharmacon: D- 010363-05)-\nggacccggcacaacuacua. A nontargeting scrambled siRNA\nserved as a negative control (Ambion: 4635).\n\nCell-based assays\nFor proliferation assay, cells were plated in 96-well\nplates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. Cell prolifera-\ntion was measured by using WST-1 (Roche) every\n24 hours over a 4- to 5-consecutive-day period, accord-\ning to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For detecting apoptosis,\ncells were transfected in a 96-well plate with siRNAs\nand assessed for apoptotic markers after 48 hours. In\nbrief, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and\ncells were permeabilized with Triton-X 100. Fixed cells\n\nLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85\n\nPage 3 of 16\n\n\n\nwere probed with active PARP (BD, 552596) antibody,\nand the primary antibodies were detected by a second-\nary antibody conjugated to fluors Alexa 488 (BD,\nA21121). ArrayScan VTI (Cellomics) was used to detect\nimmunofluorescence, and the baseline threshold was set\nby using cells stained with secondary antibody alone in\nthe absence of the primary antibody.\n\nScatter assay\nCells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 300\ncells per well and grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fifteen\nfields of colonies per cell type were captured on day 7 of\ngrowth and blindly scored for three categories of scatter-\ning (compact, loose, and scatter) by two random indivi-\nduals from six people. An average score was calculated\nfor each colony, and the percentage of colonies for each\ncategory of scattering was plotted [19].\n\nWound-healing assay\nCells were plated in culture inserts (Ibidi) with approxi-\nmately 500 \u03bcM gap. After 2 days (confluent cells), the\ninserts were removed, and fresh medium with 5 \u03bcg/ml of\nmitomycin C (Calbiochem, 47589) was added. The dis-\ntances moved by the cells across the gap were measured at\n24 hours and calculated as a ratio over the initial distance\nat 0 hours, and these data were further normalized to the\nratio of distance in Vec control.\n\nInvasion and migration assay\nIn vitro migration and invasion of the cells were assessed\nby using Falcon FluoroBlok 24-Multiwell inserts with\n8-\u03bcm pores (BD Biosciences). For invasion assays, the\ninserts were coated with 20 \u03bcg of Matrigel in 80 \u03bcl of\nserum-free media. Cell suspension (200 \u03bcl) in serum-free\nmedia was loaded into each transwell insert, and 750 \u03bcl\nof medium with 10% FBS was provided in the lower\nchamber; 4 \u00d7 104 MDA-MB231/BT-549 cells were loaded\nin each transwell. The assay was done for 18 hours for\nmigration and 24 hours for invasion. The cells that had\nmigrated or invaded through the inserts were fixed with\n3.7% formaldehyde and stained with propidium iodide,\n2 \u03bcg/ml (Calbiochem), for 30 minutes, washed with PBS,\nand counted for 10 fields by using the Target Activation\nBioapplication on an ArrayScan VTI (Cellomics). Assay\nresults for siRNA-treated MDA-MB231 cells were nor-\nmalized to fold change observed in proliferation at Day 2\nand then calculated as a ratio to the Sc siRNA control.\n\nMicroarray data analysis\nMCF-7 J1 clones were harvested for RNA isolation at\n80% confluence. For siRNA-mediated knockdown of\nJMJD6 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, the cells were har-\nvested for RNA isolation immediately, 48 hours after\n\ntransfection. Cells were washed twice with PBS and har-\nvested by trypsinization. RNA was extracted by Trizol\n(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Three\nbiological replicates of MCF-7 J1 clones and two inde-\npendent siRNA-transfection replicates were used for the\nmicroarray hybridization. Processing of samples for\nhybridization on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 was done\naccording to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The microarray\ndata were uploaded to Gene Expression Omnibus\n(accession number, GSE31782). Raw data were MAS5-\nnormalized and log transformed by using Genespring\nGX11.5. To extract differential gene expression, Gene-\nSpring GX 11.5 was used to perform two-way ANOVA\nfor siRNA-specific changes in MCF-7 and MDA-\nMB231. The list of significantly differential genes (P <\n0.05) was further filtered for genes with at least 1.5-fold\nchange in expression in at least one of the siRNA treat-\nments for either MCF-7 or MDA-MB231. For MCF-7\nJ1-OE clones, one-way ANOVA was performed to\nextract differential gene expression in the overexpression\nclones as compared with the Vec. Only genes that dif-\nfered in their expression by 1.5-fold in at least one of\nthe clones were selected for further analysis. Genes that\noverlapped in both siRNA treatment and in J1 clones\nand those that were regulated in the opposite direction\nwere selected for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) [20].\nHierarchical clustering by average linkage and visualiza-\ntion of the clusters was performed by using Cluster and\nTreeview, respectively [21,22].\nTo extract differential gene expression specific to\n\nMDA-MB231, GeneSpring GX11.5 was used to per-\nform one-way ANOVA in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7\nindependently. The list of significant genes that were\ndifferentially expressed (1.5-fold; P < 0.05) was fil-\ntered. Probesets unique to MDA-MB231 that were\nabsent in MCF-7 lists were extracted for IPA func-\ntional analysis.\n\nReal-time PCR\nTotal RNA was reverse transcribed by using Maxima\nreverse transcriptase mix (Fermentas). Real-time PCR\nwas performed by using SYBR-Green PCR Mix (Fer-\nmentas) and run on CFX384 Real Time PCR Detection\nSystem (Biorad). Ct values were generated by using CFX\nmanager software (Biorad). The primers used are listed\nin the Additional file 2, Table S2.\n\nConditioned media\nTo obtain conditioned media, plated cells were incu-\nbated with serum-free media for 24 hours before collec-\ntion. The media were spun down to remove any cell\ndebris and then concentrated \u00d760 to 80 by using Ami-\ncon Ultra centrifugation filter (Millipore).\n\nLee et al.

Protein concentration was quantified by using\nProtein Assay reagent (Biorad) with BSA standards. Equal\namounts of total protein lysates (20 to 40 \u03bcg) were ana-\nlyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF\nmembrane (GE Healthcare and Millipore). Antibodies\nagainst JMJD6 (Abcam, ab10526), b-actin (Sigma, A5441),\nV5 tag (Invitrogen, R960-25), E-cadherin (Cell Signaling,\n4065), vimentin (BD Pharmingen, 550513), TGF-b2\n(Abcam, ab36495), phosphorylated SMAD2 (Cell Signal-\ning, 3108 and 3104), phosphorylated SMAD3 (Cell Signal-\ning, 4520), SMAD2/3 (Cell Signaling, 3102), cyclin D1\n(ab24249), cyclin E1 (Abcam, ab3927), and cyclin E2\n(Abcam, ab40890) were used to probe for the protein on\nthe membrane. The detection was done by using HRP-\nconjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz) and ECL or ECL Plus\nreagents (Amersham Biosciences). Reactive proteins were\nidentified with autoradiography.\n\nTGF-b2 neutralization and Smad phosphorylation assays\nCells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000\ncells per well and changed to fresh media with either 5\nng/ml of recombinant human (rh) TGF-b2 (R&D Sys-\ntems, 302-B2) or BSA the next day. Cell-viability mea-\nsurement was taken on the first day of TGF-b2 or\nBSA treatment and 3 days later by using WST-1 assay.\nTo inhibit TGF-b2 action, cells were plated in 96-well\nplates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. After\n24 hours, they were exposed to 10 \u03bcM SB431542\n(Sigma-Aldrich, S4317) or DMSO (as vehicle control)\nbefore transfection with JMJD6 siRNA. The cells were\nchanged to fresh media 48 hours after transfection, con-\ntaining 10 \u03bcM SB431542 or DMSO. Cell viability was\ndetermined on the first day of SB431542 or DMSO\ntreatment and 3 days later by WST-1 assay. For assess-\nment of SMAD2 phosphorylation, cells were plated at\napproximately 50% confluence in six-well plates for\n24 hours. The cells were pretreated for 2 hours with\nSB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich, S4317) or DMSO, before\naddition of 5 ng/ml of rhTGF-b2 (R&D Systems, 302-\nB2). Protein lysates were harvested 1 hour after rhTGF-\nb2 treatment for immunoblot analysis.\n\nClinical correlation between TGF-b2 and JMJD6\nThe super-cohort dataset was used to assess correlation,\nif any, between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 expression. TGF-b2\nprobesets, 209908_s_at, 220407_s_at, 209909_s_at, and\n220406_at, were averaged for the clinical microarray\ndata analysis. Correlation of JMJD6 expression and\nTGF-b2 expression was performed by using the Pearson\ncorrelation test on PASW Statistics 18 [18].\n\nResults\nJMJD6 transcript levels correlate with poor prognosis in\nbreast cancer\nTo discover novel oncogenes associated with breast can-\ncer progression, we used an informatics approach [1] and\nmined multiple independent microarray datasets of\nbreast tumor profiles for genes having significant and\nreproducible associations with distant metastasis-free\nsurvival (DMFS). JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate,\nbecause its expression was significantly and positively\nassociated with decreased time to distant metastasis in\neight of the 14 breast cancer cohorts examined (Figure 1\nand Additional file 1, Table S1). Furthermore, in an inte-\ngrated Super Cohort (SC) (n = 1,954) comprising\nthe majority of the individual cohorts listed in Table 1\n(see Methods and Additional file 1, Table S1), high\nJMJD6 expression was significantly associated with\ndecreased time to distant metastasis with a hazard ratio\nof 1.92 (95% CI, 1.62 to 2.29; P < 0.001). Together, these\nobservations indicate a robust and reproducible associa-\ntion between JMJD6 expression and aggressive clinical\nbehavior of breast cancer that may reflect an underlying\nfunctional contribution of JMJD6 in breast cancer\nprogression.\n\nJMJD6 expression in breast cancer subtypes\nBreast cancers were classified based on hormone-receptor\nstatus, estrogen receptor (ER+/-), or gene expression into\nintrinsic subtypes as described by Perou et al. [23].\nBecause these subclasses show differential survival, we\nanalyzed the expression level of JMJD6 in each subtype\nannotated in the Super Cohort. As shown in Figure 2A,\noverall ER- tumors had slightly but significantly elevated\nexpression of JMJD6 (P < 0.001). The average JMJD6\nexpression differed across the intrinsic subtypes. JMJD6\nexpression was highest in Claudin-low tumors and basal\nsubtypes, followed by HER2, whereas in the ER+ group,\nthe luminal B (LumB) expressed more JMJD6 than did\nluminal A (LumA) (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). We examined\nthe survival outcome of JMJD6 high- and low-expresser\ngroups, determined by median separation across the Super\nCohort, within each subtype. Because ER- tumors had very\nhigh levels of JMJD6 expression, further separation based\non JMJD6 levels and survival analysis bore no significance\n(Table 1). In ER+ tumors, high JMJD6 expressers had\npoorer outcome than low expressers (Figure 2C; P <\n0.001), and this persisted on subdivision of ER+ into lumi-\nnal subclasses (Figure 2D and 2E). Further, in the tamoxi-\nfen-treated samples, high JMJD6 expressers had worse\noutcome. However, whether JMJD6 predicts endocrine\nfailure must be studied further. These data are summar-\nized in Table 1. Other than total cohort median-based\nseparation of patients, we also examined the relation of\n\nLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85\n\nPage 5 of 16\n\n\n\nJMJD6 levels and prognosis by quartile assignment of\nJMJD6 expression in each subtype independently. With\nthis method, we observed that extremely high expression\nof JMJD6 (upper quartile) significantly led to worse survi-\nval outcomes in luminal A and luminal B subtypes (P <\n0.05) (see Additional file 3, Figure S1). Therefore, we con-\nclude that JMJD6 is a marker for tumor aggressiveness\nand maybe is prognostic of poor outcome in ER+ breast\ncancer.\n\nJMJD6 protein associates with high-grade and ER- tumors\nTo study the distribution of JMJD6 protein levels, we\nimmunohistochemically (IHC) stained an 81-breast\ntumor tissue array by using a JMJD6-specific antibody\n(Figure 3A). MCF-7-J1 OE and JMJD6 siRNA-treated\ncells were used to confirm the specificity of the antibody\n(see Additional file 4, Figure S2). As shown, JMJD6 was\n\npresent predominantly in the nuclei of breast tumor\ncells, with increased staining evident in higher grades of\nbreast tumors. Univariate analysis clearly identified an\nassociation between high JMJD6 staining, high grade,\nand ER negativity (Figure 3B). Similar to the RNA-\nexpression data, JMJD6 protein was highly expressed in\nmore-aggressive and advanced tumors. However,\nbecause of the low sample size, our analysis could not\nexplore whether JMJD6 correlates with outcome in\nluminal tumors. Nonetheless, JMJD6 appears to be a\nrelevant marker in breast cancer pathogenesis.\n\nJMJD6 increases proliferation in MCF-7 cells\nBecause the JMJD6 expression profile was similar to the\nproliferative gene cluster, as characterized by Perou et al.\n[14,24], we posited that perturbation of its levels may\naffect cell proliferation (Figure 2A and 2B). We studied\nJMJD6 expression in a panel of five breast cancer cell lines\n(see Additional file 5, Figure S3A). With the exception of\nMCF-7 cells, JMJD6 was highly expressed in breast cancer\ncell lines. We used a lentiviral-based cloning system to\ninfect MCF-7 cells with V5-tagged JMJD6 and achieved\nstable expression of JMJD6 (MCF-7 J1-OE). As a pool,\nthese cells showed increased proliferation (see Additional\nfile 6, Figure S4), and this was confirmed in individual\nclones, J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7 (Figure 4A). Over a period\nof 5 days, MCF-7-J1-OE clones (J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7)\nshowed higher proliferation as early as day 2 and contin-\nued to grow faster as compared with empty vector control\ncells (Vec) (Figure 4A). Next we silenced JMJD6 expres-\nsion in all five cell lines by using a panel of siRNAs and\nassayed their proliferation. We achieved 80% to 100%\nsilencing of JMJD6 protein, depending on the basal, endo-\ngenous expression level of JMJD6 (see Additional file 5,\n\nFigure 1 High JMJD6 mRNA expression is associated with poor survival outcome. Cox regression analysis of JMJD6 expression and distant\nmetastasis-free survival of patients was initially performed in 14 microarray expression datasets independently and then subsequently on a\n\u201cSuper Cohort\u201d (SC) comprising 15 Affymetrix array-based cohorts, including a subset of the 14 cohorts used initially. Hazard ratios and their 95%\nconfidence intervals are shown in the forest plot.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85\n\nPage 6 of 16\n\n\n\nFigure S3A). Four different siRNAs resulted in profound\nloss of proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA MB231 cells\n(Figure 4B and 4C). This decrease was not due to\nincreased apoptosis, because higher levels of cleaved PARP\nwere not evident in the JMJD6 knockdown cells (see Addi-\ntional file 5, Figure S3B). Similar to MCF7 and MDA-\nMB231, siRNA treatment decreased proliferation in the\nremaining cell lines: BT-549, CAMA-1, and T47D (see\nAdditional file 5, Figure S3C). Together, these results sug-\ngest that high levels of JMJD6 lead to increased cell prolif-\neration. To determine whether further induction of JMJD6\nin cells with intrinsically higher JMJD6 levels shows an\nadditive increase in cell proliferation, we generated\nMB231-J1-OE, T47D-J1-OE, and CAMA-J1-OE cells (see\nAdditional file 7, Figure S5). However, an increased dosage\nof JMJD6 did not further augment cell growth\n\nJMJD6 enhances scattering and motility\nOur in silico analysis and IHC data showed that JMJD6 is\nassociated with aggressive advanced disease. We next stu-\ndied whether this protein could influence cell motility\nand invasion by using cell-scatter, wound-healing, and\nBoyden chamber assays. The motility and invasion assays\nwere performed within 24 hours to minimize secondary\neffects of cell proliferation. For the scattering phenotype,\nwe used a counting system previously described by Shtut-\nman et al. [19] to evaluate the degree of scattering\n\n(Figure 5A). All three MCF-7-J1-OE clones showed an\nincrease in scattering as compared with Vec cells. An\nincrease in scattering often implies a gain in motility or\nepithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). There-\nfore, we assayed loss of E-cadherin and gain in vimentin\nas markers for EMT. Immunoblots showed that MCF-\n7J1-OE clones maintained E-cad expression (see Addi-\ntional file 8, Figure S6), suggesting that the scattering is\nprobably encouraged by motility. Indeed, in a wound-\nhealing assay, MCF-7-J1-OE clones closed the wound\nmuch faster than did Vec cells (Figure 5B). Because\nincreased cell number due to increased proliferation can\nmislead interpretation of wound-healing data; we per-\nformed these assays in the presence of mitomycin C, an\ninhibitor of cell division. Despite a gain in motility, we\nwere unable to demonstrate an increase in invasive beha-\nvior in MCF-7-J1-OE cells (data not shown). However, in\nMDA-MB231, a highly motile and invasive cell line,\nknockdown of JMJD6 significantly attenuated both prop-\nerties (Figure 5C). To negate the contribution of\ndecreased proliferation in this assay, we normalized these\nresults to the proliferation changes observed on day 2\n(Figure 5C). However, the cells maintained loss in moti-\nlity and invasion, showing that this property was inde-\npendent of proliferation defects. Together, these data\nimply that JMJD6 is not a \u201cdriver\u201d of cell invasion but\nmay augment cell movement.\n\nFigure 2 JMJD6 expression and prognosis in intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer.

We selected 2,216 overlapping\nprobe sets that were commonly and appropriately regu-\nlated in all three settings: MCF-7-J1-OE, MCF-7 siRNA,\nand MDA-MB231 siRNA (see Additional file 9, Table S3).\n\nFigure 3 Nuclear JMJD6 protein expression is associated with high-grade breast tumors.

We analyzed these two gene sets\nwith Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [20]. In accordance with\nour cell-based assays, in the JMJD6-induced gene set, the\ntop enriched functions were cell-cycle and DNA replica-\ntion, followed by cellular assembly and cellular movement\n(Figure 6; see Additional file 10, Table S4). In the JMJD6-\nrepressed subset, a large number of genes were related to\n\ncancer function (120) (Figure 6). Among the associated\ngene functions, we observed a significant downregulation\nof TGF-b isoforms, the classic cell-cycle inhibitors [25-27]\n(see Additional file 10, Table S4), which was further con-\nfirmed by using quantitative RT-PCR. Loss of JMJD6\nincreased TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 expression, whereas TGF-\nb3 was unaffected in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 (Fig-\nure 7A and 7B). Protein analysis suggested that both\nJMJD6 siRNAs induced a high level of TGF-b2 secretion\nin the two cell lines (Figure 7C). In contrast, in MCF-7-J1-\n\nFigure 5 JMJD6 promotes motility in breast cancer cell lines.

At the\nprotein level, we failed to detect changes in TGF-b1 and\nTGF-b3, although both isoforms were expressed (data not\nshown).

To test the functionality of TGF-\nb2, we did the following: (a) assessed Smad2/3 phos-\nphorylation levels in both cells, (b) neutralized TGF-b2\nby using a TGF-b type I receptor inhibitor SB431542\nand assayed Smad phosphorylation and cell proliferation\nin the absence of JMJD6, and (c) treated MCF-7-J1OE\ncells with recombinant TGF- b2.\nBy treatment of recombinant TGF-b2 on MCF-7 and\n\nMDA-MB231, we confirmed that both cell lines\nresponded with increased SMAD2 phosphorylation,\nwhich suggests intact TGF-b receptor signaling (Figure\n8; see Additional file 11, Figure S7A). Similarly, an\nincrease in SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation with\nJMJD6 siRNA treatment was seen in both MCF-7 and\nMDA-MB231, as opposed to a decrease observed in the\nMCF-7 J1 OE clones (Figure 8). Interestingly, basal\nSMAD levels themselves were affected, which parallels\nthe transcript-level change detected in our expression\narray (Figure 6). When we inhibited SMAD phosphory-\nlation by using an Alk-5 receptor inhibitor (SB431542),\n\nwe observed a significantly higher rescue of proliferation\nin MCF-7 JMJD6 knockdown cells (Figure 9A and 9B).\nBecause MDA-MB 231 cells are refractory to TGF-b2-\nmediated cell-cycle inhibition, SB431542 should have no\neffect on MDA-MB231 growth suppression. Accord-\ningly, the suppressed proliferation could not be rescued\nby the Alk-5 receptor inhibitor treatment in this cell\ntype (see Additional file 11, Figure S7).\nLast, treatment of MCF-7 J1-OE cells with recombi-\n\nnant TGF-b2 repressed proliferation in both Vec and\nJ1-OE cells, suggesting that MCF-7 retained sensitivity\nto TGF-b2-mediated growth regulation despite increased\nJMJD6 levels (Figure 9C). Therefore, JMJD6 did not\nconfer unresponsiveness to this growth factor, but prob-\nably mediated its effect via repression of gene expres-\nsion. Together these data suggest that in MCF-7 cells,\nJMJD6 mediates cell-cycle regulation, in part by sup-\npressing TGF-b2.\nSecretion of TGF-b2 cannot explain the growth arrest\n\nin JMJD6 siRNA-treated MDA MB 231 cells.

Other pathways that\noperate in MDA-MB 231 cells must be explored further.\n\nClinical data for JMJD6 and TGF-b2\nFinally, by using expression data from the clinical\ncohorts, we observed a marginal but significant inverse\ncorrelation of JMJD6 with TGF-b2 (Pearson correlation\nvalue, -0.118; P value = 9.13 \u00d7 10-8) (Figure 11). This\nsuggests that this TGF-b2 mechanism observed in vitro\ncould be extrapolated to patient data and that the MCF-\n7-OE cells could serve as a model system to explore the\npathways involved in further detail.\n\nDiscussion\nThrough microarray informatics, we identified JMJD6 as\na candidate oncogene associated with poor patient prog-\nnosis. Consistent with its potential as a marker of breast\ncancer aggressiveness, JMJD6 was expressed at highest\nlevels in ER-, basal, claudin-low, HER2-enriched, and\nLuminal B tumor subtypes, which are known to be clini-\ncally associated with poor patient outcomes. Most\n\nimportant, in the less-aggressive ER+ subtypes (for\nexample, Luminal A), high levels of JMJD6 could predict\npoor outcome and possibly resistance to tamoxifen\nmonotherapy. Protein analysis by using tissue microar-\nray confirmed that high JMJD6 expression is consistently\nassociated with ER- disease, higher grade, and advanced\nstage. These data demonstrate for the first time that\nJMJD6 is a relevant prognostic biomarker in breast\ncancer.\nBy phenotypic and functional analysis, we found that\n\nJMJD6 induced an increase in cell scattering and\nincreased the rate of wound closure in MCF-7 cells, but\ndid not confer an invasive phenotype. In invasive cells\nlike MDA-MB231 and BT-549 with high expression of\nJMJD6, siRNA-mediated suppression led to loss of both\nmotility and invasiveness properties. Because forced\nJMJD6 expression did not confer invasiveness, this\napparent loss of invasiveness most likely follows a loss\nin motility. Nonetheless, JMJD6 may have a critical role\nin epithelial cell movement, and we showed that this\nproperty is not restricted to endothelial cells [7]. How-\never, this appears to be a minor function of JMJD6,\nbecause its exogenous expression did not induce epithe-\nlial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (that is, we did\nnot observe a loss or gain in E-cadherin or vimentin\nexpression, respectively, in MCF-7 J1-OE cells).\nThe most prominent effect of JMJD6 perturbation was\n\non cell proliferation. SiRNA-mediated attenuation of\nJMJD6 in multiple breast cancer cells led to a decrease\nin cell proliferation without activation of cellular apop-\ntosis, whereas forced expression in MCF-7 resulted in a\nmassive increase in cell proliferation. This finding is\nconsistent with the observation that JMJD6-knockout\nmice are small and show growth retardation [3]. The\nrole of JMJD6 in proliferation is further substantiated by\nour microarray analysis, which revealed that modulation\nof JMJD6 expression significantly affected the expression\nlevels of a number of cell cycle-associated genes (see\nAdditional file 10, Table S4). Although JMJD6 is thought\nto mediate splicing by physical interaction with U2AF65,\nwe obtained very little evidence for alternate transcripts\nin both cell lines. Conversely, we documented a large\nnumber of transcriptional changes in J1-OE clones and\nJMJD6 knockdowns.\nThe TGF-b pathway, particularly TGF-b2, was down-\n\nregulated when JMJD6 was overexpressed and induced\nwhen JMJD6 was depleted. We validated the inverse\nrelation between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 at both RNA and\nprotein levels in these cellular systems. We extended\nthis observation to clinical samples and observed an\ninverse correlation between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 in our\nbreast cancer cohorts. Such antagonistic roles of JMJD6\nand TGF-b2 have a precedent in eye development. One\nof the distinctive developmental defects of JMJD6-\n\nFigure 10 Decrease of cyclin E2 protein level in JMJD6\nknockdown. Western blot detection of G1 cell-cycle cyclins is\nshown.

In both MCF-\n7 and MDA-MB 231 transfected with JMJD6 siRNA, we\nobserved suppression of cyclin E expression, and an\nincrease in cyclin E was evident when JMJD6 was over-\nexpressed in MCF-7 cells. Therefore, in both cell lines,\nJMJD6 may exert a proliferative effect through a direct\nincrease in cyclin E protein levels, or this increase may\nbe a consequence of JMJD6-mediated suppression of\nTGF-b2. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, the down-\nstream effectors, Smads, were phosphorylated on JMJD6\nsiRNA-mediated secretion of TGF-b2. Specifically, in\nMCF-7, inhibition of TGF-b activity by using a TGF-b\ntype I receptor (Alk5) inhibitor resulted in the loss of\nSmad phosphorylation, rescue of arrested cells, and con-\ntinuation of proliferation (Figure 9). The Alk5 inhibitor\ndid not reverse cell-cycle arrest in MDA-MB 231 cells\nbecause they are refractory to the antiproliferative effect\nof TGF-b, suggesting that the JMJD6-cyclin E axis may\nfunction independent of TGF-b2 in these cells. Intrigu-\ningly, cyclin E is associated with poor prognosis, chro-\nmosomal instability, and trastuzumab resistance,\nsuggesting that the long-term dysregulation of cell-cycle\nmediators by JMJD6 may affect more than just prolifera-\ntion [36-38].\nOur initial microarray analysis selected genes that\n\nwere commonly regulated by JMJD6 in both MCF-7 and\nMDA-MB 231 cells. To elucidate further the mechan-\nisms behind JMJD6 siRNA-mediated growth suppression\nin MDA-MB 231 cells, we reanalyzed gene-expression\nchanges unique to MDA-MB 231 cells alone. We found\n1,864 probesets, with significant enrichment of genes\ninvolved in cellular death, growth and proliferation, and\ncell movement (P < 0.01; see Additional file 12, Figure\nS8). Close inspection showed at least 28 individual\ngenes in this proliferation gene cassette (see Additional\nfile 13, Table S5); however, no connectivity or compel-\nling pathway emerged that could be investigated further.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, our data indicate that JMJD6 has conserved\nfunctions and often affects similar pathways in a congru-\nent manner across multiple cell types and at a gene-\nexpression and phenotypic level. JMJD6 has ability to\npromote cancer cell proliferation and motility, which in\nturn may augment cancer virulence in vivo. In the clinic,\n\nJMJD6 associates with advanced grade, an aggressive\nphenotype, and serves as a marker of poor prognosis in\nbreast cancer. We propose that JMJD6 staining (with\nIHC) may serve a dual purpose in the clinic: to predict\npoor outcome in patients, particularly in the ER+ sub-\ntype, and to identify a patient subgroup wherein specific\ninhibitors of JMJD6 may facilitate the pathologic down-\nstaging of tumors in the neoadjuvant setting.\n\nAdditional material\n\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

Wa\na b s t r a c t\n\nIt has been widely reported that interleukin-8 (IL-8) is overexpressed in ovarian cyst fluid, ascites, serum,\nand tumor tissue from ovarian cancer (OVCA) patients, and elevated IL-8 expression correlates with a\npoor final outcome and chemosensitivity. However, the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisition of the\nchemoresistance phenotype and the underlining mechanisms of drug resistance in OVCA cells are not\nyet fully understood. Here we show that both exogenous (a relatively short period of treatment with\nrecombination IL-8) and endogenous IL-8 (by transfecting with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8) induce\ncisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in non-IL-8-expressing A2780 cells, while deleting of endogenous IL-8\nexpression in IL-8-overexpressing SKOV-3 cells (by transfecting with plasmid encoding for antisense IL-8)\npromotes the sensitivity of these cells to anticancer drugs. IL-8-mediated resistance of OVCA cells exhib-\nits decreased proteolytic activation of caspase-3. Meanwhile, the further study demonstrates that the\nchemoresistance caused by IL-8 is associated with increased expression of both multidrug resistance-\nrelated genes (MDR1) and apoptosis inhibitory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP), as well as activation\nof PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling. Therefore, modulation of IL-8 expression or its related signaling\npathway may be a promising strategy of treatment for drug-resistant OVCA.\n\n\ufffd 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n1. Introduction\n\nOvarian cancer (OVCA) is the second most common and the\nmost deadly malignancy of the female reproductive tract [1].\nAlthough tumor-reductive surgery and carboplatin- and paclit-\naxel-based chemotherapy regimens are effective treatments for\nprimary disease in the majority of OVCA patients, recurrence is\ncommon and often leads to death. As a consequence, the overall\n5-year survival is only 30% [2]. Thus, there is a pressing need to\neither identify novel therapies for OVCA or to discover drugs which\n(re)sensitize tumor cells to existing chemotherapy. Several factors\nhave previously been implicated in drug resistance, including\ngenes which regulate drug influx and efflux, drug metabolism,\ndamage repair, and the apoptotic response to drug-induced dam-\nage. Indeed, it is possible that numerous resistance mechanisms\nElsevier Ltd.\n\nnology, Medical College of\nrict, Chenlin Road, No. 211,\n2 60578099; fax: +86 22 022\n\nng).\ncould contribute to a drug-resistant phenotype and these mecha-\nnisms might be coordinately regulated [3].\n\nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is a multifunctional chemokine that is se-\ncreted by multiple cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils,\nendothelial and mesothelial cells, and tumor cells. As a member\nof the Cysteine-X-Cysteine (CXC) motif chemokines, IL-8 is respon-\nsible for recruiting neutrophils, T cells, and basophils during im-\nmune system activation [4\u20137]. Induction of IL-8 expression is\nmediated primarily by activator protein and/or nuclear factor kap-\npa B (NF-jB), although additional hormone response elements and\nnuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL-6) consensus sites have been character-\nized on the IL-8 gene promote [8]. Studies have shown that tumor\nprogression and metastasis may be associated with overexpression\nof IL-8 [9,10].\n\nIL-8 was elevated in ovarian cyst fluid, ascites, serum, and tumor\ntissue from OVCA patients [11\u201322], and elevated IL-8 expression\nwas associated with poor prognosis [15,22] and chemosensitivity\n[19\u201322]. Our previous study demonstrated that IL-8 may contribute\nto OVCA cell growth partly through the activation of androgen\nreceptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) pathways [23,24]. In vitro\nstudies with OVCA cell lines show that generation of paclitaxel-\nresistant sublines is often associated with increased IL-8 mRNA\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.005\nmailto:wy68wy68@yahoo.com.cn\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2011.06.005\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10434666\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/10434666\n\n\n366 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375\nexpression using cDNA array technology [25]. However, the role of\nIL-8 expression in the acquisition of the chemoresistance phenotype\nand the underlining mechanisms of drug resistance in OVCA cells\nremain unclear.\n\nIL-8 exerts its effects by binding to two cell-surface G protein-\ncoupled receptors (GPCR), IL-8 receptor A and IL-8 receptor B or\nCXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively. Both receptors are expressed on\nmost tumor cells as well as on endothelial cells [26,27]. Signals are\ntransmitted across the membrane through ligand-induced confor-\nmational changes, exposing epitopes on the intracellular loops and\ncarboxy-terminal tail of the receptor that promote coupling to func-\ntional heterotrimeric G proteins. After activation of heterotrimeric\nsmall G proteins, IL-8 signaling promotes activation of the primary\neffectors PI3 K (phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase) or phospholipase C,\npromoting the activation of Akt, PKC (protein kinase C), calcium\nmobilization and/or Ras/Raf/MEK(mitogen-activated protein or\nextracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase)/ERK(extracellular\nsignal regulated kinase) signaling cascades [8]. In addition, IL-8 sig-\nnaling activates members of the RhoGTPase family and activates a\nnumber of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases [e.g., Src family kinases\nand focal adhesion kinase (FAK)] that regulate the architecture of\nthe cell cytoskeleton and its interaction with the surrounding extra-\ncellular environment [8]. Recently, growing evidence suggests acti-\nvation of PI3 K/Akt [28\u201331] and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK [32\u201334] signaling\npathways play an important role in chemoresistance of OVCA.\nTherefore, we hypothesized that one potential mechanism that\nIL-8 induces chemoresistance of OVCA cells by triggering activation\nof PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the role of IL-8 expression in mod-\nulating cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in OVCA cells.\nFurthermore, we also explored possible underlying mechanisms\ninvolved in drug resistance induced by IL-8. Our data suggest that\nthe autocrine production of IL-8 by OVCA cells promotes resistance\nof these cells to chemotherapy through decrease of proteolytic acti-\nvation of caspase-3. The further study demonstrates that IL-8-in-\nduced resistance of OVCA cells may be associated with up-\nregulation of multidrug resistance-related genes [multidrug resis-\ntance gene 1 (MDR1)] and apoptosis inhibitory proteins [Bcl-2,\nBcl-xL and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)], as well as activa-\ntion of Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3 K/Akt signaling.\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Cell lines and cell culture\n\nHuman OVCA cell lines A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 were ob-\ntained from the American Type Culture Collection. A2780 and\nSKOV-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.,\nGaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life\nTechnologies, Inc.), CAOV-3 cells were grown in DMEM (Life Tech-\nnologies, Inc.) with 15% FBS.\n\nRecombinant human IL-8 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was\nused to pretreat A2780 cells. The cells were cultured in the pres-\nence of exogenous IL-8 (50 ng/ml) for 10 days. IL-8 was added to\nthe culture every 2 days [35]. After the pretreatment period, the\ncells (A2780/preIL-8) were harvested, washed, and replated in\nthe presence of IL-8, and their resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel\nwas determined by the MTT assay.\n2.2. pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 (i.e., sense IL-8 vector) and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-\n8 (i.e., antisense IL-8 vector) expression vector construction\n\nA 318 base pair cDNA fragment containing the full ORF of human\nIL-8 was amplified by RT-PCR from the RNA of SKOV-3 cell line that\noverexpresses IL-8. PCR primers for sense IL-8 were: forward\n50-CTCGGATCCATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTG-30 to introduce a Bam-\nHI site as italicized, and reverse 50-AGACTCGAGTTATGAATTCTCA\nGCCCTCTT-30 to introduce a XhoI site as italicized. PCR primers for\nantisense IL-8 were: forward 50-CTCGGATCCATGTGAATTCT-\nCAGCCCTCTT-30 to introduce a BamHI site as italicized, and reverse\n50-AGACTCGAGTTAACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTG-30 to introduce a XhoI\nsite as italicized. The resulting sense or antisense IL-8 PCR product\nwas cloned to pCR\ufffd 2.1 vector using Invitrogen\u2019s Original TA Cloning\nKit (Carlsbad, CA, USA). After sequence confirmation, sense or anti-\nsense IL-8 was cut from the pCR\ufffd 2.1 vector, purified, subcloned to\nthe BamHI and EcoRI (Life Technologies) sites of the pcDNA3.1(+)\nexpression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). We used DNA se-\nquence analysis and restriction enzyme mapping to distinguish be-\ntween the resulting plasmids, pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 (i.e., sense IL-8\nvector) and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8 (i.e., antisense IL-8 vector), which\nconstitutively expressed the IL-8 cDNA in the sense and antisense\norientations, respectively, from a cytomegalovirus promoter. We\nused the pcDNA3.1(+) vector without IL-8 inserts as negative con-\ntrols in subsequent experiments.\n\n2.3. Generation and selection of cells stably transfected with\npcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8 and pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8\n\nTransfection was done using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen,\nSan Diego, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions. A2780 and SKOV-3 cells (4 \ufffd 105) were plated onto 6-well\nplates until 90\u201395% confluence before transfection. A2780 cells\nwere transfected with 4 lg of pcDNA3.1(+)-ssIL-8, and SKOV-3\ncells were transfected with 4 lg of pcDNA3.1(+)-asIL-8. Selection\nfor the neomycin gene was initiated 48 h after transfection by add-\ning 500 lg (A2780 cells) or 600 lg (SKOV-3 cells) of G418 (Life\nTechnologies)/mL to the supplemented culture medium. This\nselection medium was changed every 2 days for 4 weeks, until all\nnon-transfected cells died. Resistant cell clones were isolated and\nexpanded for further characterization. The empty vector\npcDNA3.1(+) was also transfected into A2780 or SKOV-3 cells\nand served as negative controls.\n\n2.4. Semiquantitative RT-PCR\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen, San\nDiego, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Primer se-\nquences were designed by Vector NTI 8 software and synthesized\nby TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). The primer se-\nquences were as follow: IL-8, 50-AACATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCG-30\n\n(forward) and 50-CAGTTTT CCTTGGGGTCCAGAC-30 (reverse), for\nMDR1, 50-TGACTACCAGGCTCGCCAATGA T-30 (forward) and 50-TGT\nGCCACCAAGTAGGCTCCAAA-30 (reverse), for Bcl-2, 50-TGC ACCTGAC\nGCCCTTCAC-30 (forward) and 50-AGACAGCCAGGAGAAATCAAACAG-\n30 (reverse), for Bcl-xL, 50-ATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGGGAGC-30 (for-\nward) and 50-GCGATC CGACTCACCAATACCT-30 (reverse), for XIAP,\n50-ATGATACCATCTTCCAAAATC C-30 (forward) and 50-TTTCTGTAATG\nAAGTCTGACTT-30 (reverse), for b-actin, 50-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATC-\nCATGAAAC-30 (forward) and 50-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCC-\n30 (reverse). One Step RNA PCR Kit (AMV) (TaKaRa Biotechnology)\nwas used to do RT-PCR. PCR products were fractionated on 1.5% aga-\nrose gel and analyzed with Quantity One-4.5.6 software (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA). The results were normalized against b-actin, and pre-\nsented as target mRNA: b-actin ratio.\n\n2.5. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\nThe cells were cultured for 48 h in 1 ml of medium containing\n5% charcoal-stripped FBS (sFBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The\nsupernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation. The\n\n\n\nY. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375 367\nlevel of IL-8 was measured using ELISA Kits (R&D Systems)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n2.6. Western blot analysis\n\nAnalysis and quantitation were performed as previously\ndescribed [35]. In brief, cell lysates were subjected to 8\u201312 %\nSDS\u2013PAGE and analyzed by blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-\n8RA, anti-IL-8RB, anti-MDR1, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-xL, or anti-XIAP\nantibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively.\nMembranes were stripped by incubating with stripping buffer at\n50 \ufffdC for 30 min and then blotted with mouse monoclonal anti-b-ac-\ntin antibody (Sigma). Immunodetection was performed using the\ncorresponding secondary HRP-conjugated antibody, and HRP activ-\nity was detected using chemiluminescent substrate Kit (SuperSig-\nnal\ufffd Westpico Trial Kit, Pierce Biochemicals).\n\nA2780 cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes with the\ndensity of 4 \ufffd 106 cells for 24 h, and then incubated in 5% sFBS\nwith vehicle DMSO, or wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), or PD98059\n(25 or 50 lM) for 30 min prior to IL-8 (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Total cell\nlysates were isolated and quantified. The phosphorylation status of\nAkt and ERK was analyzed by Western blot as described above, ex-\ncept that the filters were probed with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-\nphospho-ERK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)\nto detect phosphorylated Akt or phosphorylated ERK, visualized\nby chemiluminescent substrate Kit. The filters were subsequently\nstripped and then reprobed with anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signal-\ning Technology, Beverly, MA) or anti-ERK (BD Biosciences, San\nDiego, CA) to detect both the phosphorylated and unphosphory-\nlated forms of Akt or ERK.\n\n2.7. Cytotoxicity assay\n\nIn vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed by MTT assay as\npreviously described [23,24]. MTT was obtained from Sigma\n(St. Louis, MO, USA). Briefly, 4 \ufffd 104 cells per well were plated in\n96-well plates. Culture medium was RPMI 1640 containing\nincreasing concentrations of cisplatin or paclitaxel (all obtained\nfrom commercial sources). After culture for 48 h, MTT solution\n(0.5 mg/ml PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h.\nAfter dissolving the resulting formazan product with acid-isopro-\npanol, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using ELISA micro-\nplate reader. Data represents the average absorbance of six wells in\none experiment. The percentage of surviving cells was estimated\nby dividing the A490 nm of treated cells by the A490 nm of control\ncells. The IC50 is defined as the drug concentration required to in-\nhibit A490 to 50% of the control value. IC50 values were estimated\nfrom the dose\u2013response curve. Data were derived from at least\nthree independent experiments.\n\nA2780 cells pretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8) were plated in\n96-well plates at 4 \ufffd 103 cells per well for 24 h, and then incubated\nin 5% sFBS with vehicle DMSO, or wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), or\nPD98059 (25 or 50 lM) for 30 min prior to IL-8 (50 ng/ml) and cis-\nplatin (1 or 10 lM) or paclitaxel (0.01 or 0.1 lM) or control for\n48 h. MTT assay was performed as described above. Data are\nshown as the mean \u00b1 SD of two separate experiments with sextu-\nple samples.\n\n2.8. Caspase-3 activation assay\n\nCaspase-3 activation assay was performed as previously\ndescribed [35]. Briefly, cells left untreated or treated with 10 lM\ncisplatin or 0.1 lM paclitaxel for 24 h and then lysed in lysis buffer\nfor 10 min on ice. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm\nfor 5 min, and 100 lg of protein was incubated with 20 ll of reac-\ntion buffer and 10 ll of caspase-3 substrate at 37 \ufffdC for 1 h, and\nabsorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm on a plate\nreader. Blank values were subtracted, and fold increase in activity\nwas calculated based on activity measured from untreated cells.\nEach sample was measured in triplicates.\n\n2.9. Statistical analysis\n\nData are expressed as the mean of three experiments, each in\ntriplicate or sextuple samples for individual treatments or dosage\nregimens. Statistical analysis was carried out using a one-way AN-\nOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Values are presented as the\nmean \u00b1 SD. All statistical tests were two-sided and were consid-\nered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Comparing expression levels of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA and\nIL-8RB) as well as sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCA\ncell lines\n\nIn order to investigate the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisi-\ntion of the chemoresistance phenotype in OVCA cells, we first ana-\nlyzed the expression of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA and IL-8RB) as\nwell as the response to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCA cell\nlines. The secretion levels of IL-8 were significant various in three\nOVCA as shown in Fig. 1A. High and middle levels of IL-8 secretion\nwere observed in CAOV-3 (12298.40 \u00b1 305.47 pg/ml) and SKOV-3\n(715.92 \u00b1 35.28 pg/ml), respectively. However, no IL-8 was de-\ntected in the supernatant from A2780 cells. The mRNA levels of\nIL-8 resembled their respective protein levels in three OVCA cells\n(Fig. 1B). As determined by Western blot analysis, these three cell\nlines were demonstrated to express IL-8RA and IL-8RB (Fig. 1C).\nThe sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel also varied among these\ncell lines as shown in Fig. 1D and E. A2780 cells were the most sen-\nsitive (IC50 for cisplatin and paclitaxel were 8.06 \u00b1 0.49 lV and\n0.74 \u00b1 0.08 lV, respectively), whereas CAOV-3 (IC50 for cisplatin\nand paclitaxel were 74.40 \u00b1 0.82 lV and 9.65 \u00b1 0.35 lV, respec-\ntively) and SKOV-3 cells (IC50 for cisplatin and paclitaxel were\n66.19 \u00b1 3.42 lV and 6.67 \u00b1 0.17 lV, respectively), were drug-resis-\ntant (P < 0.001), indicating that autocrine production level of IL-8\nby OVCA cell lines were inversely associated with their sensitivity\nto cisplatin and paclitaxel. Taken together, these results suggest\nthat IL-8 receptor-bearing OVCA cell lines, A2780 (non-IL-8-\nexpressing and drug-sensitive) and CAOV-3 or SKOV-3 (IL-8-over-\nexpressing and drug-resistant) are the suitable cell models to\ninvestigate the effect of IL-8 on cisplatin- or paclitaxel-mediated\ncytotoxicity in OVCA cells.\n\n3.2. IL-8 confers cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in OVCA cells\n\nPrevious reports have suggested that elevated IL-8 expression\ncorrelates with poor prognosis [15,22] and chemosensitivity\n[19\u201322]. In correlation, our above results showed that autocrine\nproduction level of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines were inversely associ-\nated with their responsiveness to cisplatin and paclitaxel. It sug-\ngests that IL-8 could play a role in the resistance of OVCA cells to\nthe cytotoxic activities of anticancer compounds. To address this\nhypothesis, A2780 cells were cultured in the presence or absence\nof IL-8 for 10 days. After the pretreatment period, the cells were\nharvested, washed, and replated in the presence or absence of IL-\n8, and their resistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel was determined\nby the MTT assay [23,24]. Pretreatment of A2780 cells with IL-8\ncaused 6.07-fold and 7.23-fold increase in resistance to cisplatin\nand paclitaxel, respectively (P < 0.001, Fig. 2), indicating that the\npresence of exogenous IL-8 increased the resistance of OVCA cells\nto cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Expression pattern of IL-8 and its receptor (IL-8RA and IL-8RB) as well as different sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel in three OVCA cell lines. (A and B) Expression of\nIL-8 protein and mRNA in OVCA cell lines. Secreted IL-8 production in three cell lines were analyzed by ELISA. Data are shown as the mean of three separate experiments with\ntriplicate samples and represent the mean \u00b1 SD. The mRNA level of IL-8 was detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Target fragment levels were normalized against b-actin. (C)\nExpression of IL-8RA and IL-8RB protein in OVCA cell lines. The same amount of total cell lysate of A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells were separated by 10% SDS\u2013PAGE gel,\nfollowed by Western blot with anti-IL-8RA antibody, anti-IL-8RB antibody or anti-b-actin antibody. Target protein levels were normalized against b-actin to control for\nvariance in sample loading and transfer. (D and E) Different responsiveness to cisplatin or paclitaxel in A2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells was assessed by the MTT assay. The\nexperiment shown is representative of three independent experiments with similar results.\n\n368 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375\nTo determine whether the endogenous production of IL-8 by tu-\nmor cells could provide self-protection against drug-induced cell\ndeath, we constitutively expressed IL-8 in A2780 cells and inhib-\nited expression of IL-8 in SKOV-3 cells and examined the effect\nof IL-8 expression on the drug resistance of these cells. A2780 cells\nwere transfected with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8 and SKOV-3\ncells were transfected with plasmid encoding for antisense IL-8.\nStable A2780 (A2780/ssIL-8) and SKOV-3 (SKOV-3/asIL-8) transfec-\nted clones were isolated and screened for their ability to produce\nIL-8. Three representative clones that produced low (19.86 \u00b1\n6.24 pg/ml, A2780/ssIL-8L), middle (73.44 \u00b1 9.02 pg/ml, A2780/\nssIL-8 M) and high (101.81 \u00b1 13.01 pg/ml, A2780/ssIL-8H) levels\nof IL-8 (P < 0.001, Fig. 3A) and two representative clones that were\nmiddle (64.13%, SKOV-3/asIL-8 Mi) and high (77.52%, SKOV-3/asIL-\n8Hi) inhibition of IL-8 production (P < 0.001, Fig. 3C) compared\nwith the corresponding parental (i.e., untransfected) and control\nvector-transfected A2780 and SKOV-3 cells were chosen for subse-\nquent studies. The levels of IL-8 gene expression in the stable\ntransfected clones were also examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR\nanalysis. The levels of IL-8 mRNA were consistent with the secreted\nIL-8 levels in these stable transfected clones (Fig. 3B and D).\n\nTo determine whether the endogenous production of IL-8 in\nA2780 cells can confer resistance to drug treatment, we examined\nthe susceptibility or resistance of ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells to\ncisplatin or paclitaxel treatment using the MTT assay. As shown in\nFig.4A and B, A2780/ssIL-8L, A2780/ssIL-8M and A2780/ssIL-8H\ncells exhibited increased resistance to both cisplatin (6.49-fold,\n7.39-fold and 8.53-fold, respectively) and paclitaxel (6.36-fold,\n7.59-fold and 8.08-fold, respectively), as compared with\nparental A2780 cells (P < 0.001). Control A2780/pcDNA3.1(+) cells\nthat did not produce IL-8 exhibited similar drug sensitivity to\nparental A2780 cells (P > 0.05). These data suggest that over-\nexpressing of IL-8 confers a moderate level of drug resistance in\nOVCA cells.\n\nTo determine whether deleting of endogenous IL-8 in SKOV-3\ncells could increase their responsiveness to drug treatment, we\nalso examined the susceptibility or resistance of asIL-8-transfected\nSKOV-3 cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel. In correlation with data\nfrom ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells, SKOV-3/asIL-8Mi and SKOV-\n3/asIL-8Hi cells exhibited increased responsiveness to both cis-\nplatin (IC50 was 10.58 \u00b1 1.67 and 7.75 \u00b1 0.88 lV, respectively,\nFig. 4C) and paclitaxel (IC50 was 0.89 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.76 \u00b1 0.04 lV,\nrespectively, Fig. 4D) as compared with parental SKOV-3 (IC50 for\ncisplatin and paclitaxel were 66.50 \u00b1 3.42 and 6.79 \u00b1 0.45 lV,\nrespectively) and control SKOV-3/pcDNA3.1(+) cells (IC50 for cis-\nplatin and paclitaxel were 65.32 \u00b1 4.18 and 6.74 \u00b1 0.33 lV, respec-\ntively) (P < 0.001), which did not vary (P > 0.05). These results\nindicate that deleting of endogenous IL-8 by OVCA cells restores\ntheir response to chemotherapy.\n\nCaspase-3 plays a direct role in proteolytic cleavage of cellular\nproteins responsible for progression to apoptosis. To test whether\ncisplatin and paclitaxel resistance or susceptibility in ss/asIL-8-\ntransfected cells may have affected caspase-3 activity with cis-\nplatin or paclitaxel exposure, we measured caspase-3 activities in\nthese cells after exposure to two drugs. As shown in Fig. 5, there\nwas a significantly reduced level of caspase-3 in ssIL-8-transfected\nA2780 cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 5A and B), while there was a markedly\nincreased in asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 cells (P < 0.001, Fig. 5C and\n\n\n\nFig. 2. Treatment with IL-8 increased the resistance of A2780 cells. A2780 cells\nwere cultured in the presence (A2780/preIL-8) or absence (A2780) of exogenous IL-\n8 for 10 days. After the pretreatment period, the cells were replated in the presence\nor absence of IL-8, and their resistance to cisplatin (A) or paclitaxel (B) was\ndetermined by the MTT assay. The experiment shown is representative of three\nindependent experiments with similar results.\n\nY.

Representative ELISA and RT-PCR demonstrating levels of IL-8 expression in A278\nempty vector or with vector encoding for sense IL-8, and SKOV-3 cells were stably transfe\nIL-8-transfected A2780 clones that produced low (A2780/ssIL-8L), middle (A2780/ssI\nIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 clones that were middle (SKOV-3/asIL-8Mi) and high (SKOV-3\nvector-transfected A2780 and SKOV-3 cells were isolated for further studies. \u2044P > 0.05, \u2044\n3.3. IL-8 up-regulates MDR1 expression in OVCA cells\n\nCross-resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel suggests a mul-\ntidrug resistant phenotype possibly explained by drug transport or\nmetabolism, cellular repair or detoxification mechanisms. To eval-\nuate this possibility the expression of several genes already known\nto be involved in the mutidrug resistance phenomenon [MDR1,\nglutathione S transferase pi (GSTpi), multidrug resistance-associ-\nated protein (MRP), lung resistance-related protein (LRP) and topo-\nisomerase I (TopoI)] in above several OVCA cell lines was first\nmeasured by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.\nThis analysis demonstrates that the mRNA and protein levels of\nMDR1, GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown) are lower in\nA2780 cells, while those are higher in CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells,\nindicating that autocrine production levels of IL-8 by OVCA cell\nlines were consistent with the expression levels of above several\nputative resistance factors in these cells. To determine the effects\nof exogenous and endogenous IL-8 on mutidrug resistance-related\ngenes, we further studied IL-8-induced above several putative\nresistance factors expression of mRNA and protein in A2780 cells\ntreated with IL-8, ss/asIL-8-transfected cells and the corresponding\nuntransfected and control vector-transfected cells by semiquanti-\ntative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. IL-8 significantly up-reg-\nulated the mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 (Fig. 6A and B) but\nnot GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown) in a dose-depen-\ndent manner in A2780 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of MDR1\n(Fig. 7A and B) but not GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI (data not shown)\nenhanced in ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells (Fig. 7A and B), and re-\nduced in asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 7C and D) compared\nwith the corresponding parental and control vector-transfected\ncells, which had no difference. Therefore, these data suggest that\nIL-8 may confer cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in OVCA cells\nby increasing MDR1 expression.\n\n3.4.

Similarly, the responsiveness of\ntwo asIL-8-transfected SKOV-3 clones and their parental and control vector-transfected cells to cisplatin (C) and paclitaxel (D) was examined by the MTT assay.\n\nFig. 5.

To determine\nthe another potential mechanism through which IL-8 causes\nchemotherapy resistance in OVCA cells, we also examined the\nexpression levels of several apoptosis inhibitory proteins in above\nseveral OVCA cell lines. The mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-\nxL, XIAP and survivin (data not shown), are lower in A2780 cells,\nwhereas those are higher in CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells, suggesting\nthat autocrine production levels of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines were\nalso in agreement with the expression levels of four apoptosis\ninhibitory proteins studied in these cells. To determine the effects\nof IL-8 on these apoptosis inhibitory proteins, we further studied\nIL-8-mediated mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

IL-8 significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels\nof Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP (Fig. 6C and D) in a dose-dependent man-\nner, but had no effect on the mRNA and protein levels of survivin\n(data not shown) in A2780 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of\nBcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP (Fig. 8) but not survivin (data not shown)\nup-regulated in ssIL-8-transfected A2780 cells (Fig. 8A and B),\nand down-regulated in as IL-8-transfected SKOV3 cells (Fig. 8C\nand D) compared with the corresponding untransfected and con-\ntrol vector-transfected cells, which did not vary. Taken together,\nthese results suggest that IL-8 may cause chemoresistance in OVCA\ncells by enhancing Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP expression.\n\n3.5. IL-8-induced chemoresistance to OVCA cells is through PI3K/Akt\nand Ras/MEK/ERK activation\n\nTo investigate what role PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways\nplay in the signal transduction of IL-8 in OVCA cells, we deter-\nmined the effects of wortmannin, a PI3 K specific inhibitor at 100\nor 200 nmol/L, and PD98059, a MEK1/2 specific inhibitor at 25 or\n50 lmol/L, on IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK and\nIL-8-induced cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance of A2780 cells. It\nwas found that wortmannin and PD98059 significantly antago-\nnized IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, respectively\n(Fig. 9A and B), and both of them blocked IL-8-induced cisplatin\nand paclitaxel resistance (Fig. 9C and D) and the inhibitory effects\nof wortmannin and PD98059 were dependent on its concentration.\nThese data confirm that activation of Akt and ERK are mediated by\nPI3 K- and MEK1/2-dependent mechanism, respectively, and\nsuggest that IL-8-induced cisplatin or paclitaxel resistance to OVCA\ncells is through activation of PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK.\nIn addition to detecting increased phosphorylation of Akt, in-\ncrease in Akt expression in A2780 cells was also indicated by den-\nsitometry analysis after stimulation with IL-8 (Fig. 9B). Therefore,\nour experiments indicate that IL-8 signaling increases both the\nactivation and the expression level of Akt in OVCA cells.\n4. Discussion\n\nIt has been widely reported that IL-8 is overexpressed in ovarian\ncyst fluid, ascites, serum, and tumor tissue from OVCA patients\n[11\u201322], and elevated IL-8 expression correlates with a poor final\noutcome [15,22] and chemosensitivity [19\u201322]. Previous work\nfrom our group and others has shown that IL-8 promotes OVCA cell\ngrowth [22\u201324,27]. In the present study, we first demonstrated\nthat autocrine production level of IL-8 by OVCA cell lines, including\nA2780, CAOV-3 and SKOV-3, is inversely associated with their re-\nsponse to cisplatin and paclitaxel. Some studies have consistently\ndemonstrated that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells are resistant to cis-\nplatin, while A2780 cells are responsive [40,41]. Our data further\ndemonstrated that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells were also paclit-\naxel-resistant and A2780 cells were paclitaxel-sensitive. Further-\nmore, we found that CAOV-3 and SKOV-3 cells produced higher\nlevels of IL-8, while A2780 cells do not. Notably, we also observed\nthat A2780 cells expressed IL-8 receptor, though they did not se-\ncrete IL-8, suggesting that the expression of IL-8 receptor by OVCA\ncells could be not associated with their IL-8 production status.\nTherefore, IL-8 receptor-bearing OVCA cell lines, non-IL-8-express-\ning and cisplatin/paclitaxel-responsive A2780, and IL-8-over-\nexpressing and cisplatin/paclitaxel-resistant CAOV-3 or SKOV-3\nwere used to study the effect of IL-8 on multidrug resistance, but\nin our study, A2780 and SKOV-3 cell lines were chosen as suitable\ncell models.\n\n\n\nFig. 9. Effects of wortmannin or PD98059 on IL-8-induced phosphorylation of Akt or ERK in A2780 cells and IL-8-mediated cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance to A2780 cells\npretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8). The cells were pretreated with wortmannin (100 or 200 nM), PD98059 (25 or 50 lM) or DMSO of equal volume for 30 min at 37 \ufffdC\nbefore IL-8 was added into the medium. (A and B) A2780 cells were cultured for 6 h in the presence of IL-8. After the cells were collected and washed, whole-cell extracts were\nprepared and subjected to Western blot assay. (C and D) The cells were seeded into 96-well plate (4 \ufffd 104 cells per well) and cultured in the presence of IL-8 (50 ng/ml) and\ncisplatin (1 or 10 lM) or paclitaxel (0.01 or 0.1 lM) for 48 h. Afterwards, MTT assay was performed to determine the effect of wortmannin and PD98059 on IL-8-induced\ncisplatin or paclitaxe resistance to A2780 cells pretreated with IL-8 (A2780/preIL-8). The experiment shown is the average data of three independent experiments. \u2044P > 0.05,\ncompared with control; \u2044\u2044P < 0.001, compared with cisplatin or paclitaxel (no inhibitors).\n\nY. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375 373\nSeveral recent studies have addressed the role of IL-8 in tumor\ncell chemoresistance, including in melanoma [42], colorectal can-\ncer [43], renal cell carcinoma [44], and prostate cancer [45,46].\nHowever, the role of IL-8 expression in the acquisition of the mul-\ntidrug resistance phenotype in OVCA has not been investigated.\nHere we show that both exogenous (a relatively short period of\ntreatment with recombination IL-8) and endogenous IL-8 (by\ntransfecting with plasmid encoding for sense IL-8) induce cisplatin\nand paclitaxel resistance in non-IL-8-producing A2780 cells,\nwhereas deleting of endogenous IL-8 expression in IL-8-over-\nexpressing SKOV-3 cells (by transfecting with plasmid encoding\nfor antisense IL-8) promotes the sensitivity of these cells to anti-\ncancer drugs. Meanwhile, we confirm that IL-8-mediated resis-\ntance of OVCA cells exhibits decreased proteolytic activation of\ncaspase-3. These findings suggest that the production of IL-8 pro-\ntects the cells from cytotoxic agents through down-regulation of\nproteolytic activation of caspase-3 and expression level of IL-8 is\npositively associated with their degree of chemoresistance in OVCA\ncells. Other studies have shown that transfection of IL-8 into colo-\nrectal cancer [43] or prostate cancer cell line [45] causes drug resis-\ntance and inhibition of IL-8 overexpression in colorectal cancer\n[43] or prostate cancer [45,46] cell lines with small interfering\nRNA (siRNA) increases the sensitivity of these cells to anticancer\ndrugs. Thus, some tumor cells may acquire the ability to express\nand produce IL-8 as a protective mechanism against drug induced\ndeath. The stimuli responsible for the constitutive expression of IL-\n8 in chemoresistant cells are not yet fully understood. Previous\nfindings have suggested that expression of IL-8 is regulated by a\nnumber of different stimuli including inflammatory signals (e.g.,\ntumor necrosis factor a, IL-1b), chemical and environmental\nstresses (e.g., exposure to chemotherapy agents and hypoxia),\nand steroid hormones (e.g., androgens, estrogens, and dexametha-\nsone; reviewed in Ref. [47]). These stimuli may be associated with\nthe constitutive expression of IL-8 in chemoresistant cells, but fur-\nther experiments need to be done to determine this presumption.\n\nIn OVCA, up to two-thirds tumor specimens have been found to\noverexpress MDR1 (also known as ABCB1, which encodes the P-\nglycoprotein) on immunohistochemistry [48\u201350], and this overex-\npression has been shown in some cases to correlate with poor\noverall survival and chemotherapy resistance. Recently studies\nhave shown that inhibition of MDR1 expression by siRNA in human\nmultidrug resistant OVCA cell lines enhances the intracellular\naccumulation of and restored sensitivity to cisplatin [51]. The re-\nsults of the many studies cited above suggests that MDR1 play\nan important role in the mechanisms responsible for chemoresis-\ntance of OVCA cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-8 regulates\nexpression of MDR1 but not GSTpi, MRP, LRP and TopoI in OVCA\ncells, in correlation, increases the resistance of the cells to cis-\nplatin/paclitaxel treatment. Thus, the regulation of MDR1 gene\nexpression is a potential mechanism by which IL-8 provides drug\nprotection. In this study, we first demonstrate that IL-8 up-regu-\nlates MDR1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA\ncells.\n\nA number of studies have shown that the anti-apoptotic ability\nof IL-8 was associated with expression of the Bcl-2 and Inhibitor of\nApoptosis (IAP) families proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin\n[46,52]. Bcl-2 [36], Bcl-xL [37], survivin [38] and XIAP [39] have\nbeen shown in OVCA to be associated with resistance to chemo-\ntherapy. Thus, we investigated whether IL-8 alters the expression\nof apoptosis inhibitory proteins as a mechanism of drug resistance.\nWe found that IL-8 increased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and XIAP\nbut not survivin in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA cells as a\n\n\n\n374 Y. Wang et al. / Cytokine 56 (2011) 365\u2013375\nmechanism of drug resistance. The enhancement of Bcl-2 and\nBcl-xL expression by IL-8 in OVCA cells is in accordance with the\nresults of Singh et al. [46] in prostate cancer cell line. While our\nfindings that survivin levels are not altered by IL-8 in OVCA cells\nis different from the results of Wilson et al. [52], who have reported\nthat stimulation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells\nwith IL-8 increases the transcription and expression of survivin.\nHere we provide the first evidence that IL-8 may up-regulates XIAP\nexpression in a dose-dependent manner in OVCA cells.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence implicated that the activation of PI3\nK/Akt [28\u201331] and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK [32\u201334], the most important\ncell survival signalings, protects OVCA cells from chemotherapy.\nIt has reported that Akt inactivation sensitizes human OVCA cells\nto cisplatin [28] and paclitaxel [29]. Moreover, the inactivation of\na downstream targets of the PI3 K/Akt pathway, such as BAD [28]\nand the transcription factors of Forkhead [53] and NFjB [54], also\nsensitize human OVCA cells to cisplatin in vitro. Finally, Akt inacti-\nvation by a PI3 K inhibitor also enhances the sensitivity of OVCA to\ncisplatin [28] and paclitaxel [29] in vivo. It has been shown that cis-\nplatin treatment activates ERK in OVCA cells and that activation of\nERK protects OVCA cells from cisplatin-induced death [32\u201334].\nFurthermore, inhibition of ERK signaling by the MEK1/2 inhibitor\nPD98059 blocked ERK activation and increased cisplatin sensitivity\nin SKOV-3 cells [33]. In this study, IL-8-induced activation of ERK\nand Akt in OVCA cells is blocked by their specific inhibitors to sig-\nnal transducers, which inhibit IL-8-induced cisplatin and paclitaxel\nresistance of OVCA cells. Also, we interestingly find that IL-8 in-\ncreases not only phosphorylation of Akt but expression of Akt in\nOVCA cells, which is in accordance with the result of MacManus\net al. [55] in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our data suggest\nthat IL-8 promotes chemoresistance of OVCA cells via activation of\nmultiple signal transduction pathways including PI3 K/Akt path-\nway and ERK cascade. In toto, these results provide support for\nthese signal transduction pathways as a strategy for reversing drug\nresistance.\n\nIn summary, we conclude that IL-8 secreted by OVCA cells may\ncontribute to the refractoriness of these cells to conventional che-\nmotherapy through down-regulation of proteolytic activation of\ncaspase-3. Furthermore, IL-8-induced chemoresistance may be\nassociated with increase of both multidrug resistance-related\ngenes (MDR1) and apoptosis inhibitory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL\nand XIAP), as well as activation of PI3 K/Akt and Ras/MEK/ERK.\nTherefore, modulation of IL-8 expression or its related signaling\npathway may be a promising strategy of treatment for drug-resis-\ntant OVCA.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by Grants from the National Natural\nScience Foundation of China (No. 81041071), Tianjin Municipal Sci-\nence and Technology Commission (No. 08JCYBJC06900), Postdoc-\ntoral Science Foundation of China (No. 20080441340) and\nProgram for Science and Technology in Medical College of Chinese\nPeople\u2019s Armed Police Forces (No. WYM201105, WY200914).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Risch HA.

Ribosome construction requires\nassembly of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four different species of rRNA. As RPs co-assemble into\none multi-subunit complex, mutation of the genes that encode RPs might be expected to give rise to phenocopies, in which\nthe same phenotype is associated with loss-of-function of each individual gene. However, a more complex picture is\nemerging in which, in addition to a group of shared phenotypes, diverse RP gene-specific phenotypes are observed. Here\nwe report the first two mouse mutations (Rps7Mtu and Rps7Zma) of ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7), a gene that has been\nimplicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Rps7 disruption results in decreased body size, abnormal skeletal morphology, mid-\nventral white spotting, and eye malformations. These phenotypes are reported in other murine RP mutants and, as\ndemonstrated for some other RP mutations, are ameliorated by Trp53 deficiency. Interestingly, Rps7 mutants have\nadditional overt malformations of the developing central nervous system and deficits in working memory, phenotypes that\nare not reported in murine or human RP gene mutants. Conversely, Rps7 mouse mutants show no anemia or\nhyperpigmentation, phenotypes associated with mutation of human RPS7 and other murine RPs, respectively. We provide\ntwo novel RP mouse models and expand the repertoire of potential phenotypes that should be examined in RP mutants to\nfurther explore the concept of RP gene-specific phenotypes.\n\nCitation: Watkins-Chow DE, Cooke J, Pidsley R, Edwards A, Slotkin R, et al.

Ribosomes\n\nthemselves, which consist of small (40S) and large (60S) subunits,\n\nare assembled from about 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs)\n\nalong with four species of rRNA synthesized in the nucleolus [1,2].\n\nRPs fall broadly into two categories; the RPL proteins that make\n\nup the large ribosomal subunit, and the RPS proteins that\n\nconstitute the small subunit. Mutations in both RPL and RPS\n\ngenes have been implicated in a set of shared phenotypic\n\ncharacteristics in invertebrates. This is best illustrated by the\n\napproximately 50 Drosophila melanogaster Minute mutants, a collec-\n\ntion of ribosomal gene mutations that are characterized by\n\ndevelopmental delay, short thin bristles, growth retardation,\n\nreduced fertility and recessive lethality [3].\n\nIn vertebrates, a phenotypic overlap among RP mutants occurs\n\nsimilar to that seen in Drosophila Minute mutants, however\n\nadditional phenotypic complexity is emerging, in which mutation\n\nor suppression of RPs results in some phenotypes that depend\n\nupon which gene is mutated. This is highlighted by a recent study\n\nin which 20 different RP genes were targeted using morpholino\n\nantisense oligos in the zebrafish Danio rerio [4]. Whereas some\n\nphenotypes were shared among knockdowns, such as hypoplasia of\n\nthe yolk sac, others were gene-specific. For instance, knockdown of\n\nrps15 resulted in an enlarged 4th ventricle of the brain, whereas\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nknockdown of rpl35a caused a sharply bent tail, and targeting of\n\nrps29 produced an enlarged lens [4]. A similar picture of\n\nphenotypic overlap paired with gene-specific phenotypes is\n\nemerging in mice. For example, mutations in Rps19 and Rps20\n\nresult in increased epithelial pigmentation, a ventral belly spot,\n\nsmall body size, and a reduction in red blood cell count [5]. Mice\n\nwith mutations in Rpl24 also have ventral belly spots and body size\n\nreduction, but they present with additional retinal abnormalities\n\nand skeletal defects [6]. Mice harboring the Rpl27a sooty foot allele\n\nshare an epidermal hyperpigmentation phenotype with Rps19 and\n\nRps20 mutants, but display the additional feature of cerebellar\n\nataxia [7]. These distinct features of individual RP mutant\n\nphenotypes suggest that vertebrate RPs may have unique, tissue-\n\nspecific functions and/or tissue-specific expression levels. Indeed,\n\nthe broad spectrum of distinct phenotypes that have been\n\ncharacterized in a relatively small number of mammalian RP\n\nmutants also hints at possible extra-ribosomal functions of RPs.\n\nIn humans, mutations in RPs have been implicated in\n\nhematopoetic disorders, most notably Diamond-Blackfan anemia\n\n(DBA), which has been attributed to mutations in RPS19, RPS26,\n\nRPS24, RPS17, RPS10, RPS7, RPL35a, RPL26, RPL11, and RPL5\n\n[8\u201314]. While anemia is a shared phenotype among all patients\n\ncarrying these various gene mutations, some specific attributes are\n\nassociated with individual genes. For example, mutations in RPL5\n\nare associated with cleft palate and anomalies of the thumb and\n\nheart, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominant in\n\npatients carrying mutations in RPL11 [11].\n\nIn this paper, we further examine the role of ribosomes in\n\nmammalian development by investigating Rps7. Through analysis\n\nof two new ENU-induced mouse mutants of Rps7, montu (Mtu)\n\nand zuma (Zma), we show that mutation of Rps7 impairs ribosomal\n\nbiogenesis, resulting in variable lethality and reduced body size\n\naccompanied by abnormal skeletal, melanocyte, eye, and central\n\nnervous system (CNS) development. While many of these\n\nphenotypes have previously been associated with mutation of\n\nmurine RP genes, the findings of overt brain malformations and\n\nbehavioral abnormalities are novel. Similar to mutation of other\n\nRP genes in the mouse, the penetrance of the Rps7-associated\n\nphenotypes is affected by genetic background and the overt\n\nphenotypes are suppressed by TRP53 deficiency. These mutants\n\nprovide the first mouse models of Rps7 disruption and increase our\n\nunderstanding of the phenotypic consequences of mammalian RP\n\nmutations.\n\nResults\n\nIdentification and genetic mapping of montu and zuma\nThe montu (Mtu) mouse was identified in a large-scale ENU\n\nmutagenesis program [15,16] exhibiting dominant inheritance of a\n\nventral belly spot, kinked tail, and reduced body weight (Figure 1A,\n\n1B). Linkage analysis was performed using a cross of the Mtu\n\nfounder (BALB/c OlaHsd background) with C3H/HeH. Analysis\n\nof genotypes of 104 offspring demonstrated linkage to a 74 Mb\n\nregion of proximal chromosome 12 that was further refined to a\n\n3.43 Mb critical region (Figure S1A, S1C). DNA sequencing of\n\nexons and flanking regions of 17 candidate genes using genomic\n\nDNA from four affected animals and controls identified a single\n\nheterozygous sequence variant occurring only in affected mice\n\nwithin exon 6 of Rps7, which encodes a 194 amino acid ribosomal\n\nprotein, RPS7 (or S7e, the eukaryotic specific homolog of the yeast\n\nS7A and S7B). The identified Rps7 variant, c.574T.G\n\n(NM_011300), encodes a Gly substitution of a highly conserved\n\nVal residue (p.V156G; NP_035430) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A).\n\nSubsequent sequence analysis of 91 animals from a C3H/HeH\n\ncongenic Mtu colony showed 100% concordance between the\n\nc.574T.G mutation and the affected phenotypes. Analysis of Mtu\n\nanimals demonstrated variable penetrance on a mixed back-\n\nground, however 100% penetrance of the tail kink, belly spot, and\n\nsmall body size phenotypes when assessed in the C3H/HeH\n\ncongenic colony. We also observed a dominant lethality phenotype\n\nwith incomplete penetrance, 72% viability in F1 BALB/c:C3H\n\nmice (N = 251) and 26% viability in the C3H/HeH congenic\n\ncolony (N = 260).\n\nThe zuma (Zma) mouse was independently identified as part of a\n\nsensitized ENU screen designed to identify mutations that\n\nincreased the severity of neural crest defects observed in Sox10\n\nhaploinsufficient mice (Sox10LacZ/+), a well characterized neural\n\ncrest mutant which presents with a high frequency of small, white\n\nbelly spots [17]. Affected backcross mice (BALB/cJ6C57BL/6J)\nfrom the Zma pedigree exhibited large white belly spots, tail kinks,\n\nand reduced body size. Linkage analysis of twelve affected N1\n\nmice initially detected linkage of Zma to a region of chromosome\n\n12 overlapping where the Mtu mutation was localized (Figure S1B,\n\nS1C). Subsequent sequencing of Rps7 in Zma mice revealed a\n\nheterozygous A to C point mutation in exon 7 of Rps7, predicted\n\nto cause substitution of a conserved amino acid (p.Y177S;\n\nc.637A.C) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A). Genotyping analysis of\n\nZma mice outcrossed to C57BL/6J to establish a congenic colony\n\nshowed that the c.637A.C mutation was observed in 100% of\n\naffected mice. We initially observed incompletely penetrant\n\nphenotypes in N2 heterozygous Zma mice on a mixed BALB/cJ;\n\nC57Bl/6J background, where Zma/+ mice showed 74% viability,\n76% belly spots, and 90% tail kinks (N = 46). However,\n\nheterozygosity for the Zma allele rapidly changed to a completely\n\npenetrant, lethal phenotype during outcrossing onto C57BL/6J,\n\nand no Zma/+ mice were observed at N4. This contrasted with the\nphenotype we observed during establishment of a congenic C3H/\n\nHeJ Zma colony; on this genetic background, the N3 generation\n\nexhibited a low frequency of belly spotting and tail kinks (4% and\n\n0%, respectively; N = 41) yet no lethality, as Zma heterozygotes\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nRibosomes are composed of two subunits that each\nconsist of a large number of proteins, and their function of\ntranslating mRNA into protein is essential for cell viability.\nNaturally occurring or genetically engineered mutations\nwithin an individual ribosomal protein provide a valuable\nresource, since the resulting abnormal phenotypes reveal\nthe function of each ribosomal protein. A number of\nmutations recently identified in mammalian ribosomal\nsubunit genes have confirmed that homozygous loss of\nfunction consistently results in lethality; however, haploin-\nsufficiency causes a variety of tissue-specific phenotypes.\nIn this paper, we describe the first mutant alleles of the\ngene encoding ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7) in mouse. Rps7\nhaploinsufficiency causes decreased size, abnormal skele-\ntal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eye\nmalformations, phenotypes that also occur with haploin-\nsufficiency for other ribosomal subunits. Additionally,\nsignificant apoptosis occurs within the developing central\nnervous system (CNS) along with subtle behavioral\nphenotypes, suggesting RPS7 is required for CNS devel-\nopment. Mutation of human RPS7 has been implicated in\nDiamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), yet the murine alleles do\nnot present an analogous phenotype. The phenotypes we\nobserve in the Rps7 mouse mutants indicate RPS7 should\nbe considered as a candidate for a broader spectrum of\nhuman diseases.\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nwere observed at the expected frequency through N6. The\n\ncomparably mild phenotype we observed in the congenic C3H/\n\nHeJ Zma colony suggests that the Mtu allele may exert more severe\n\nphenotypic effects than the Zma allele. This hypothesis is\n\nsupported by the observations that Mtu/+ mice presented with\nreduced viability, fully penetrant belly spots, tail kinks, and small\n\nbody size on a predominantly C3H/He genetic background, while\n\nZma/+ mice on a similar background were observed at the\nexpected frequency and were generally indistinguishable in\n\nphenotype from their+/+littermates.\nSequencing of exons 6 and 7 of Rps7 in 9 inbred strains (A/J,\n\nAKR/J, BALB/c, C57BL6/J, C3H/HeJ, CBA, DBA, LP/J, and\n\n101) confirmed that the point mutations detected in Mtu and Zma\n\nare not natural variants. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of\n\nthe mutations in Rps7 transcripts using Mtu/+ and Zma/+ cDNA for\nsequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. We also demonstrated\n\na lack of complementation between the Mtu and Zma Rps7 alleles by\n\nperforming an intercross of heterozygous mice from the two lines.\n\nGenotyping of newborn offspring revealed that no animals carried\n\nboth the Mtu and Zma mutations (N = 27) (Figure S1D). The lack of\n\nviable double heterozygotes was consistent with homozygote\n\nlethality observed in each line, thus showing non-complementation\n\nof the two alleles. Collectively, the similar phenotypes, sequencing\n\ndata, and genetic analyses provide strong evidence that the\n\nmutations identified in Rps7 are responsible for the observed Mtu\n\nand Zma phenotypes, hereafter referred to as Rps7Mtu and Rps7Zma.\n\nFigure 1. Heterozygous mutation of Rps7 results in visible white spotting, small body size, and tail kinking.

The consequences of the RPS7Mtu\n\nand RPS7Zma mutant proteins were first assessed using the\n\ncomputational analyses PANTHER and SIFT. Results from the\n\nPANTHER coding SNP analysis tool [18] suggested that both\n\nmutations are likely to be deleterious (PANTHER subPSEC score\n\nof 25.00 and 25.06 for RPS7Mtu and RPS7Zma, respectively).\n\nSimilarly, the Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT) algorithm\n\n[19] predicted both alleles to affect protein function, however, the\n\nhigh degree of conservation in the 72 database sequences at each\n\nposition resulted in a low confidence level for the prediction (SIFT\n\nprediction score 0.00, median conservation 3.59 for both RPS7Mtu\n\nand RPS7Zma). Collectively, the computational analysis was\n\nconsistent with the Rps7Mtu and Rps7Zma alleles both having\n\nfunctional consequences.\n\nThe potential effects of p.V156G and p.Y177S on RPS7\n\nsecondary structure (Figure 1D, Figure S2) were also examined.\n\nThere is no three-dimensional protein structure currently available\n\nfor metazoan RPS7, therefore we used the available structures\n\nfrom Tetrahymena thermophila (PDB ID 2XZM) and Saccharomyces\n\ncerevisiae (PDB ID 3U5C), whose RPS7 ortholog sequences share\n\n37% and 55% residue identity with mouse RPS7, respectively\n\n[20,21]. RPS7 structural elements appear to be highly conserved\n\nacross species: the S. cerevisiae and T. thermophila proteins themselves\n\nshare only 34% amino acid identity, yet their solved three-\n\ndimensional structures superimpose well, and are consistent with\n\nsecondary structural predictions of mouse RPS7 generated using\n\nPSSpred (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/PSSpred) and\n\nPROFsec [22] (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the S. cerevisiae and T.\n\nthermophila sequences each contain a Tyr residue homologous to\n\nmouse p.Y177 (Figure S2A), and a Val residue homologous to\n\nmouse p.V156 is present in S. cerevisiae and substituted conserva-\n\ntively with Ile in T. thermophila. The introduction of either p.V156G\n\nor p.Y177S into the mouse sequence did not alter predictions of\n\nthe beta strand and alpha helix at the respective locations of the\n\nsubstitutions (Figure S2B), suggesting that grossly altered second-\n\nary structure may not be responsible for the functional\n\nconsequences of RPS7Mtu or RPS7Zma.\n\nWe next used biochemical analyses to examine the effects of\n\np.V156G and p.Y177S on stability and subcellular localization of\n\nthe 22 kiloDalton (kDa) protein as well as ribosome assembly and\n\nbiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that nonsense mutations\n\nin RPS19 can result in decreased protein levels, and missense\n\nmutations can alter the capacity of RPS19 to localize to the\n\nnucleolus [23]. C- and N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type,\n\nRPS7Mtu and RPS7Zma proteins were transiently expressed in\n\nhuman embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Western blot analysis\n\nrevealed no differences in protein levels for any of the RPS7\n\nmutant proteins (Figure 2A, Figure S3A). The remaining in vitro\n\nstudies were focused on the potentially more severe RPS7Mtu\n\nmutant protein. Analysis of the FLAG-tagged proteins revealed no\n\nnotable differences in subcellular localization of the RPS7Mtu\n\nprotein (Figure 2B). To verify the capacity of RPS7Mtu to be\n\nincorporated into the ribosome, cytoplasmic extracts from\n\ntransiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated to\n\nseparate ribosomes and ribosomal subunits (in the pellet) from\n\nfree cytoplasmic proteins (in the supernatant). A similar fraction of\n\nall transfected RPS7 proteins was observed in the ribosomal pellet\n\n(Figure S3B) indicating that the mutation does not alter RPS7\n\nassembly into the ribosome. To confirm this finding, cytoplasmic\n\nextracts from Rps7Mtu/+ liver were analyzed by ultracentrifugation\nthrough sucrose gradients, and the ratio between the peaks of the\n\nribosomal subunits in the absorbance profile was determined. This\n\nratio can reveal defects in the synthesis of one of the two subunits,\n\nsuch as the net increase of the 60S/40S ratio seen in cultured\n\nhuman cells following depletion of single RPs [24,25]. However,\n\nthe observed 60S/40S ratio in Rps7Mtu/+ liver was similar to\ncontrol (Figure S3C), indicating that RPS7Mtu does not drastically\n\nalter assembly of the ribosomal subunits.\n\nWe further assessed whether RPS7Mtu affects ribosomal\n\nbiogenesis by analyzing the pre-rRNA maturation pattern.\n\nAlterations are visualized by the accumulation of specific rRNA\n\nprecursors: a defect in large subunit RPs affects cleavage of 28S\n\nprecursors, whereas a defect in small subunit RPs alters that of 18S\n\nprecursors. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from wild-type\n\nand Rps7Mtu/+ tissue, using a probe for the internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) 1 of pre-rRNA that anneals to 18S rRNA precursors\n\n[26,27], indicated that 18S rRNA pre-rRNA processing was\n\naltered both in liver and brain from Rps7Mtu/+ mutant mice\n(Figure 2C). Quantitative measurement of the hybridization\n\nsignals showed a significant accumulation of the 30S precursor\n\nin Rps7Mtu/+ (indicated by an increased 30S/21S ratio; Figure 2D),\nconfirming altered rRNA precursor processing and demonstrating\n\nthat the RPS7Mtu mutation has functional consequences on\n\nribosomal biogenesis.\n\nCharacterization of the Rps7 phenotype\nSkeletal and eye malformation. X-ray examination of\n\nadult Rps7Zma/+ mice showed that vertebral fusion is responsible\nfor the tail kinks (Figure 3A, 3B). Similar results were observed for\n\nRps7Mtu/+ adult mice, indicating that in both mutants, defective\nsomitogenesis occurs as a result of RPS7 alterations. Decreased\n\nvertebrae numbers were also observed in both mutants; a\n\nreduction in total vertebrae number in Rps7Mtu/+ (52\u201355 versus\n55\u201357 in wild-type) and in caudal vertebrae number in Rps7Zma/+\n\n(16\u201319 versus 20\u201322 in wild-type). The decreased vertebrae\n\nnumbers indicate defective tail bud function associated with\n\ndefects in RPS7. Alcian blue and alizarin red staining of late\n\ngestation Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ embryos (N = 3 for each\ngenotype) revealed further Rps7Zma/+-associated skeletal abnor-\nmalities, including general disorganization of vertebral processes\n\nand arches in the cervical vertebrae (Figure 3C, 3D). The anterior\n\ntuberculum was appropriately located on C6, however a very\n\nsmall partial rib was observed on C7 (in 2 Rps7Zma/+ embryos),\nindicating an incompletely penetrant transformation of C7 to T1.\n\nWithin the thoracic region, we observed a shortened first\n\nsternebrae and asymmetric attachment of 8 ribs to the sternum\n\nrather than the usual 7 (in all 3 Rps7Zma/+ embryos) (Figure 3E,\n3F). Within the lumbar and sacral regions, a severe developmental\n\ndelay was observed, and disorganization of the ossification centers\n\nwas evident with some ossification centers being duplicated\n\n(Figure 3G, 3H). Additionally, we observed a transformation of\n\nL1 to T13 (in all 3 Rps7Zma/+ embryos) and also asymmetric fusion\nof the transverse processes of the first 5\u20136 sacral vertebrae (in 2\n\nRps7Zma/+ embryos) rather than the 3\u20134 observed in Rps7+/+\n(Figure 3H). Collectively the skeletal phenotypes observed in Rps7\n\nmutants are consistent with an anterior transformation of the axial\n\nskeleton.\n\nFrequent microphthalmia and uveal coloboma were also\n\nobserved as features of the Rps7 mutant phenotype (Figure 4).\n\nRps7Zma/+ embryos showed eye malformations ranging from\nminor delay in optic fissure closure to severe microphthalmia and\n\ninternalization of the entire eye structure. Whole mount micro-\n\nscopic imaging of E12.5 embryos revealed that 100% of Rps7Zma/+\nembryos exhibited a unilateral or bilateral delay in closure of the\n\noptic fissure, as compared to Rps7+/+ embryos which all showed\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nnormal optic fissures (N = 5 Rps7Zma/+, N = 7 Rps7+/+)\n(Figure 4A\u20134C). By E14.5, a time when wild-type embryos have\n\ncomplete fissure, 100% of Rps7Zma/+ embryos still displayed optic\nfissure closure defects either unilaterally (N = 2) or bilaterally\n\n(N = 3) (Figure 4D\u20134F). Additionally, more severe microphthal-\n\nmia and internalization of the eye was observed in 20% of\n\nRps7Zma/+ embryos (Figure 4F, 4I; 1 out of 5 at both E12.5 and\nE14.5).\n\nCirculating blood chemistry and erythroid\n\ndifferentiation. Because human RPS7 mutations are associated\n\nwith DBA [11], a disease characterized by red cell aplasia, we\n\nundertook an initial characterization of circulating blood in adult\n\nRps7Mtu/+ mice (on a C3H/He background) and Rps7Zma/+ mice\n(on a mixed C57BL/6J; BALB/cJ background). Neither Rps7\n\nmutant allele caused any significant differences from Rps7+/+\nlittermates in total hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) counts, white\n\nblood cell (WBC) counts, or hematocrit (Figure 5A, 5B, Table S1).\n\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV) was slightly elevated in Rps7Mtu/\n\n+ mice (elevated 1.026 fold over wild-type, p,0.05) (Figure 5A),\nhowever no significant difference in MCV was observed in\n\nRps7Zma/+ mice (Figure 5B). Additional analyses of plasma\nbiochemistry revealed no significant differences between\n\nRps7Mtu/+ and Rps7+/+ animals in major electrolytes and\nmetabolic indicators (Na+, K+, Cl2, urea, creatinine, ALP, AST,\n\nALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, amylase, and free fatty\n\nacids) (Table S2).\n\nTo further assess erythroid development of Rps7Zma/+ mice,\nwhich exhibit perinatal lethality on a C57BL/6J background,\n\nE13.5 Rps7Zma/+ fetal liver samples were characterized by flow\ncytometry. We simultaneously used monoclonal antibodies against\n\nthe erythroid cell lineage markers CD71, expressed at higher levels\n\nduring early stages of erythroid differentiation, and Ter119,\n\nexpressed at higher levels as erythrocytes mature, to profile 5\n\ncharacteristic populations of erythroid precursors (R1 to R5)\n\n[28,29] (Figure 5C). These cell populations correspond to\n\nincreasingly differentiated developmental stages, with R1 marking\n\nerythroid progenitors and proerythroblasts, R2 marking proeryth-\n\nroblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts, R3 marking all\n\nbasophilic erythroblasts, R4 marking chromatophilic and ortho-\n\nchromatophilic erythroblasts, and R5 marking late orthochroma-\n\ntophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Compared to their Rps7+/\n+ littermates, Rps7Zma/+ E13.5 embryos showed a significant\nincrease in the percentage of R3 cells (p,0.001) suggesting that\n\nerythroid precursors could be blocked in their maturation\n\n(Figure 5D). However, analysis of erythroid cell populations of\n\nE14.5 fetal livers showed that the percentages of cells in the R2\u2013\n\nR5 populations were indistinguishable between Rps7+/+ and\nRps7Zma/+ genotypes (Table S3). The presence of the more mature\nR4 and R5 cells at E14.5 indicates erythroid differentiation\n\nprogresses, rather than being blocked at R3. Alternatively, the\n\nincrease in R3 cells at E13.5 may result from a general\n\ndevelopmental delay in Rps7Zma/+ embryos. This was confirmed\nby inspection of gross anatomical features of crown-rump length,\n\nalong with eye, limb, and craniofacial development at E11.5\u201313.5,\n\nwhich showed that Rps7Zma/+ embryonic development is delayed\nby approximately one day relative to that of Rps7+/+ littermates\n(Figure S4). While we cannot rule out subtle alterations in\n\nerythroid maturation that may cause the differences observed in\n\nthe precursor populations, these analyses collectively suggest that\n\nthese two mutant alleles of Rps7 do not significantly impair red\n\nblood cell production or differentiation.\n\nEarly effect on melanoblast development. To assess the\n\neffects of RPS7 mutation on melanocyte development, we\n\ncharacterized Rps7Zma/+ mutant embryos from E10.5 to 14.5.\n\nFigure 2.

In these Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) embryos, Dct-positive\nmelanoblasts were notably reduced by E10.5 relative to Rps7+/+;\nTg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6A, 6B). At E14.5, a significant\n\nreduction in melanoblast number was still observed in both the\n\nhead and trunk of Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice compared to\nRps7+/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6C\u20136F). Mutation of\nRps7 did not cause a complete loss of melanoblasts, however, as\n\nDct-positive cells could still be observed at E14.5 in regions where\n\nmelanoblast density is normally highest, particularly around the\n\ndeveloping pinna and eye (Figure 6C, 6D). This severe melano-\n\nblast reduction in Rps7Zma/+ embryos was independently con-\nfirmed by in situ hybridization with a probe targeting mRNA for\n\nthe melanoblast/melanosome-specific protein Pmel17 (Figure S5).\n\nQualitative observation of Pmel17-expressing melanoblasts showed\n\nthat E12.5 Rps7Zma/+ mutant embryos displayed a marked\nreduction in melanoblasts relative to E12.5 Rps7+/+ littermates.\nThe reduction in melanoblasts is more severe than can be\n\nattributed to the developmental delay observed in Rps7Zma/+\nmutants, as E12.5 Rps7Zma/+ embryos showed a reduced\nmelanoblast number even in comparison to E11.5 Rps7+/+\nembryos (Figure S5). A combination of Rps7 and Sox10\n\nhaploinsufficiency (Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes)\nfurther reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (Figure S6),\n\nconsistent with the increased spotting observed in rare Rps7Zma/\n\n+; Sox10LacZ/+ pups that survived postnatally (Figure S7A, S7B).\nPostnatally, we observed that melanocytes were present in the\n\ntail skin of Rps7Zma/+ mice (Figure S7E, S7F), yet no dark skin\nphenotype occurred in the tails or footpads of adult Rps7Zma/+ or\nRps7Mtu/+mice (Figure S7C\u2013S7F). This indicates that these Rps7\nmutations do not cause epidermal melanocytosis, as was previously\n\nobserved for mutation of Rps19 and Rps20 [5]. Collectively, these\n\ndata show that mutation of Rps7 causes a severe, early reduction in\n\nmelanoblasts that is sufficient to account for the white belly\n\nspotting observed in viable heterozygotes.\n\nEnlarged ventricles, cortical thinning, and deficits in\n\nworking memory. We examined the neuroanatomical features\n\nof the Rps7 mutants, employing histological techniques and\n\nmagnetic resonance microscopy (MRM). Gross observations and\n\nhistological staining revealed marked cortical thinning accompa-\n\nnied by enlarged ventricles in adult Rps7Mtu/+ (Figure 7A\u20137B) and\nperinatal Rps7Zma/+ mice (Figure 7C, and data not shown). To\ninvestigate this phenotype further, we undertook MRM imaging of\n\nRps7Zma/+ mice at E18.5 (N = 3) (Figure 7D\u20137I). Following\nmanual segmentation of 10 major anatomic structures, the volume\n\nof each brain region was calculated as a percentage of the total\n\nbrain volume (Figure 7J) and 3-dimensional (3D) rendering with\n\nsmoothing was performed to generate 3D representations (Video\n\nS1 and Video S2). This quantitative analysis showed that the\n\nRps7Zma/+ CNS phenotypes originate during development and\nconfirmed a significant reduction in cortical (P = 0.0002) and\n\nhippocampal (P = 0.0044) size in Rps7Zma/+ mutants. Although\nlateral ventricle volume was not significantly different between\n\nthese small groups, qualitative observations of ventricle size at\n\ndissection, in MRM images, and in histological sections consis-\n\ntently indicated Rps7Zma/+ mutants had enlarged ventricles,\nleading us to conclude that enlarged ventricles are a consistent\n\nfeature of the Rps7 phenotype.\n\nWe investigated whether these gross neuroanatomical pheno-\n\ntypes affected the behavior of the Rps7Mtu/+ mice, assessing\nlocomotor activity, anxiety and working memory. The results\n\nshowed that while Rps7Mtu/+ mutants exhibited normal locomotor\nactivity and anxiety-related phenotypes, they displayed deficits in\n\nFigure 3. Skeletal abnormalities in Rps7 mutants.

Rps7Mtu/+ mutants displayed similar behavior to\nRps7+/+ controls in an open-field test, with no significant\ndifferences in total distance travelled in the open field or time\n\nspent in the center (Figure S8A). Similarly, there were no\n\nsignificant differences between Rps7+/+ controls and Rps7Mtu/\n+littermates when assessed on the elevated plus-maze (Figure S8B\u2013\nS8E), nor did Rps7Mtu/+ mutant animals display any ataxia that\nwould be indicative of motor dysfunction. We also investigated\n\nwhether Rps7Mtu/+ mice displayed any defects in working memory\nusing a spontaneous alternation test, which can indicate hippo-\n\ncampal dysfunction [31]. The mouse is placed in the start arm of\n\nan enclosed T-maze (the base of the \u2018\u2018T\u2019\u2019), and allowed to enter a\n\ngoal arm (the two arms of the top of the \u2018\u2018T\u2019\u2019) of its own choice.\n\nUpon repeating this test, the mouse can demonstrate memory of\n\nits previous choice by entering the arm not visited before, a\n\nbehavior called spontaneous alternation. Here we observed a\n\nsignificant difference between Rps7+/+ controls, which exhibited\nan average alternation frequency of 83%, and Rps7Mtu/+ mutants,\nwhich exhibited an average alternation frequency of only 68%\n\n(N = 9, P = 0.01) (Figure 7K). Collectively, the MRM and\n\nbehavioral data indicate that Rps7 is required for normal\n\ndevelopment of the central nervous system, particularly the\n\ntelencephalon, and that mutations in this gene have the capacity\n\nto affect hippocampal-dependent behavior.\n\nIncreased neuronal apoptosis in Rps7 mutants. Our\n\nhistological studies also revealed that late gestation Rps7Zma/+\nembryos exhibited pyknotic nuclei in the white matter tracts of the\n\nspinal cord (Figure S9), consistent with CNS degeneration. As\n\nmutations in other RPs have been associated with increased\n\ncellular apoptosis [32\u201337], we used immunohistochemistry to\n\ndetect cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) within the CNS. When compared\n\nto normal littermates, Rps7Zma/+ embryos showed increased\napoptosis in the cortex and neural tube at both E11.5\n\n(Figure 8A, 8B, 8D, 8E) and E12.5 (data not shown). Although\n\nmitotic, phospho-histone H3-positive (PH3+) cells surrounding the\nlumen of the neural tube appeared slightly disorganized in E11.5\n\nand E12.5 Rps7Zma/+embryos (Figure 8G, 8H and data not\nshown), cell counting revealed no significant difference in PH3+\ncell number per section compared to Rps7+/+ littermates\n(Figure 8J). In contrast, CC3 counts confirmed a significant\n\nincrease in apoptosis in the neural tube of E11.5 Rps7Zma/+\nembryos compared to Rps7+/+ (N = 3, p,0.001) (Figure 8K).\nConsistent with the location of apoptosis and with a putative role\n\nfor RPS7 in CNS development, in situ hybridization studies on\n\nFigure 4.

Using immunohistochemistry, we observed an\n\nincrease in TRP53 staining in the cortex (E11.5) and neural tube\n\n(E11.5 and E12.5) of Rps7 mutants consistent with increased\n\nTRP53-mediated apoptosis (Figure S11). Collectively, the histol-\n\nogy and immunohistochemistry data confirm that massive cell\n\ndeath in the Rps7 mutant CNS occurs at the onset of neurogenesis.\n\nPhenotypic suppression of Rps7 mutant phenotypes\n\nbyTrp53 haploinsufficiency. In an attempt to restore hetero-\n\nzygote viability by suppressing apoptosis, we crossed the Rps7Zma\n\nmutation onto a Trp53 mutant background. Trp53 mutations have\n\nbeen used to successfully suppress phenotypes in other RP mutants\n\n[5,35]. Rps7Zma mice were originally identified on a mixed genetic\n\nbackground, and heterozygote lethality in Rps7Zma/+ mice\nincreased as the mutation was outcrossed onto a C57BL/6J\n\nbackground. Thus we used early generation, mixed background\n\nRps7Zma/+ mice to establish a cross with Trp53 mutant mice on a\nC57Bl/6J background (B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Tyj/J, hereafter\n\nTrp53KO). Within a few generations of outcrossing, no viable\n\nRps7Zma/+ mice were observed after birth, as expected. However,\nRps7Zma/+; Trp53 KO/+ double heterozygotes were recovered at\nthe expected 50% frequency, suggesting restoration of Rps7Zma/+\nviability in the context of Trp53 haploinsufficiency (Table S4). In\n\nFigure 5.

In most cases Rps7Zma/+;\nTrp53KO/+ double heterozygotes were indistinguishable from their\nwild-type littermates after weaning, with the exception of a very\n\nsmall belly spot observed in 47% of Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ mice.\nTrp53 haploinsufficiency also suppressed the phenotypes of gross\n\nembryonic developmental delay (Figure S4), the subtle delay in\n\nerythroid maturation (Table S3), and CNS apoptosis (Figure 8C, 8F,\n\n8K). In summary, the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in Rps7Zma/+\nmice all appeared to be suppressed by Trp53 haploinsufficiency.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we present genetic, functional, and phenotypic\n\nevidence that the montu (Mtu) and zuma (Zma) mouse lines isolated\n\nfrom independent ENU screens harbor distinct point mutations in\n\nRps7. These first-reported alleles of Rps7 in mice cause similar\n\nphenotypes including small body size, tail abnormalities, mid-\n\nventral white spotting, eye defects, and an underdeveloped\n\ncerebral cortex.\n\nWe provide functional evidence that the Rps7Mtu mutation\n\n(p.V156G) affects ribosome biogenesis. The altered Rps7Mtu 30S/\n\n21S ratio is consistent with the altered pre-rRNA maturation\n\nreported for a DBA patient harboring an RPS7 donor splice-site\n\nmutation (c.147+1G.A) that results in accumulation of 30S and\n45S precursors [11]. A requirement for RPS7 during rRNA\n\nmaturation is supported by other studies showing a role for human\n\nRPS7 in early stages of 45S rRNA processing [24] or the nuclear\n\nstages of 40S maturation [38]. In yeast, depletion of the two RPS7\n\nparalogs (S7a and S7b) results in a severe growth defect [39,40]\n\nand S7 has been hypothesized to play an early role as a component\n\nof the small subunit processome [41] as well as a later role in\n\nribosome biogenesis during assembly of polysomes [42]. However,\n\nthe mechanism underlying the altered rRNA maturation in these\n\nmurine Rps7 mutants is not clear, as neither the Rps7Mtu nor the\n\nRps7Zma mutation is predicted to grossly disrupt protein secondary\n\nstructure, and RPS7Mtu protein is correctly localized and\n\nincorporated into ribosomes in cultured cells. Presumably, the\n\nmutant RPS7 proteins could be altered in their interactions with\n\nrRNA, other ribosomal proteins, or non-ribosomal proteins. The\n\npossibility of interaction with non-ribosomal proteins is intriguing\n\ngiven the position of RPS7 at the surface of the ribosome (Figure\n\nS2C, S2D) in close proximity to the binding site for eIF4G [21], a\n\neukaryotic initiation factor important for assembling the pre-\n\ninitiation complex. Interestingly, most other known, viable mouse\n\nRP mutations also occur in eukaryotic-specific RPs located at the\n\nsurface of the ribosome. Additional work is needed to determine\n\nthe precise role RPS7 plays in mammalian ribosome biogenesis\n\nand how the Rps7Mtu and Rps7Zma mutations disrupt this function.\n\nWhile modeling the pre-rRNA processing defect of an RPS7\n\nDBA patient, these Rps7 mutant mice do not replicate the\n\ncharacteristic DBA phenotype of severe anemia. This lack of an\n\nanemia phenotype is not entirely unexpected, since the analysis of\n\nmany mouse mutants suggests that mice as a species are generally\n\nless sensitive than humans to any gene haploinsufficiency [43,44].\n\nThis is exemplified by the fact that, despite frequent mutation of\n\nFigure 6. Melanoblast numbers are reduced in Rps7Zma/+ mutants. (A, B) In transgenic embryos carrying the melanoblast reporter Tg(Dct-\nLacZ), whole mount staining showed that Dct-positive melanoblasts are significantly reduced at E10.5 in Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice (A) compared\nto Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (B). The reduction is noticeably apparent over the otic region (red circle). (C,D) Whole mount staining of E14.5\nRps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) embryos showed that these embryos (D) also display a reduction in melanoblasts relative to Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates\n(C). The microphthalmia observed in Rps7Zma/+ mice is apparent in (D).

It is possible that further studies of Rps7 alleles on different\n\ngenetic backgrounds or in mice with more severe alleles may\n\nreveal additional red blood cell phenotypes. In the future,\n\ncomparison among mouse DBA models may provide insight into\n\nwhy the murine and human hematological phenotypes do not fully\n\noverlap, and may also reveal why mutation in RPS19 has a\n\nuniquely high frequency in DBA compared to other RPs that\n\ncause the disease.\n\nBoth Rps7 mutants display a variety of skeletal phenotypes that\n\ncollectively suggest that normal ribosome biogenesis is required for\n\nthree distinct stages of somite development, which governs\n\nsubsequent axial skeleton formation. First, the decreased number\n\nof tail vertebrae indicates an insufficient production of somite\n\nprogenitors. Second, the mutant vertebral fusion leading to tail\n\nkinks is indicative of incorrect somite border formation. Third, the\n\nmutants exhibit an array of axial skeleton defects consistent with\n\nFigure 8.

Widespread disturbances of the skeletal system\n\nencompassing each of these three defects are also found in Rpl38\n\n(tail short, Ts) [46,47] and Rpl24 (belly spot and tail, Bst) mutants\n\n[6,48]. Indeed, there are striking similarities in the defects\n\nobserved in Rpl38 and Rps7 mutants, including specific transfor-\n\nmations within the cervical (C7 to T1), thoracic (T8 to T7), lumbar\n\n(L1 to T13) and sacral (fusion of additional transverse processes)\n\nregions. Mutations in Rpl38 and Rpl24 cause additional distur-\n\nbances of the appendicular skeleton not observed in Rps7,\n\nhowever, given the similarities of these mutants to Rps7 it will be\n\ninteresting to see if appendicular skeletal defects are observed with\n\ndifferent Rps7 alleles and/or genetic backgrounds. Interestingly,\n\nsevere skeletal malformations have not been reported for five other\n\nmurine RP mutants (Rps19, Rps20, Rpl22, Rpl27a, Rpl29)\n\n[5,7,8,49,50]. This suggests that either mutation of RP proteins\n\ndo not universally affect skeletal development, or skeletal defects\n\nremain to be identified in these other RP mutants. In the case of\n\nRps7, the severity of skeletal defects was modified by both genetic\n\nbackground and by allele, suggesting that detailed characterization\n\nin existing and additional RP mutants is necessary to further\n\nexplore the role of RP proteins in skeletal development.\n\nWe show that Rps7Zma-mediated white spotting results from a\n\nsevere developmental reduction in melanoblasts. A developmental\n\nreduction in melanoblasts has also been reported in Rps19 and\n\nRps20 heterozygous mutants, however, these mutants subsequently\n\ndevelop epidermal melanocytosis [5], a phenotype not seen in\n\neither Rps7 mutant. This difference is unlikely to be due to genetic\n\nbackground, as both Rps7 mutants and Rps19 and Rps20 mutants\n\nwere examined on a predominantly C3H background. Alterna-\n\ntively, the difference could be a more severe developmental\n\nreduction in melanoblast numbers in Rps7 mutants, resulting in\n\nfewer melanoblasts available at later time points to generate\n\nepidermal melanocytosis. Another possibility is that loss of Rps7\n\nmay not have the same effect in keratinocytes as loss of Rps6, Rps19\n\nand Rps20, which are thought to act in keratinocytes to produce\n\nTRP53-mediated dark skin [5]. Our in vitro experiments with Rps7\n\n(Figure 2 and Figure S3) suggest that these mutations are\n\nhypomorphic alleles, so a third possibility is that allele severity,\n\nrather than gene-specific function, could account for pigmentation\n\nphenotype differences among RP mutants.\n\nThe mouse Rps7 mutants display additional developmental\n\ndefects of reduced cortical and hippocampal size. We hypothesize\n\nthat cell death within the developing CNS is sufficient to account\n\nfor the neocortical thinning we observe in both Rps7 mutant lines.\n\nWe also hypothesize that apoptosis within the developing\n\ntelencephalon might account for the deficit in working memory\n\nobserved in Rps7Mtu/+ heterozygotes. To our knowledge, this is a\nnovel developmental brain abnormality in mouse arising from RP\n\nhaploinsufficiency, differing substantially from the only other\n\nreport of neuronal defects in RP mutant mice, that of cerebellar\n\nabnormalities and ataxia in Rpl27a sooty foot mutants [7].\n\nInterestingly, the neuronal phenotypes in mouse Rps7 mutants\n\ncorrelate with the report of microcephaly as one of 11 congenital\n\ncraniofacial anomalies that can be associated with DBA [51], and\n\nare consistent with RP mutant phenotypes observed in different\n\nmodel organisms. In zebrafish, gene-specific neuronal phenotypes\n\nwere seen in a subset of knocked-down RPs [4] and further studies\n\nof RPL11 revealed brain deformities and reduced neuronal\n\nprogenitor cells along with apoptosis in the affected regions [32].\n\nIn the zebra finch, RPL17 and RPL37 both regulate the sexually\n\ndimorphic formation of the song control regions of the brain\n\nwithin the VZ [52]. Thus, the murine Rps7 mutant phenotypes\n\nadd to a growing body of literature linking individual RPs to\n\nspecific features of neural development and suggesting that other\n\nRP mouse mutants may have previously uncharacterized defects in\n\nbrain development.\n\nImportant questions remain regarding what underlying cellular\n\nmechanisms explain the similarities and differences among RP-\n\nassociated phenotypes. A growing body of literature suggests a\n\ncommon mechanism where alterations in RP expression result in\n\nactivation of TRP53, suggesting ribosomal stress is one of the\n\nmany cellular anomalies detected by TRP53. For example, in their\n\nstudy of RP-mediated dark skin, McGowan and colleagues show\n\nthat TRP53 acts as a sensor of ribosomal integrity, and that\n\nmutations in Rps19 and Rps20 can be phenotypically suppressed by\n\nTrp53 deficiency [5]. Trp53 haploinsufficiency also relieves the\n\nabnormal phenotypes of mice heterozygous for the sooty foot\n\nataxia allele of Rpl27a [7] or the Bst allele of Rpl24 [6]. Similarly,\n\nour results show that loss of Rps7 increases TRP53 levels and that\n\nTrp53 haploinsufficiency suppresses all morphological aspects of\n\nthe Rps7 phenotype. Our in vivo studies are supported by recent\n\nstudies showing that Rps7 depletion in vitro as well as in vivo in\n\nzebrafish induces TRP53 expression [53,54], and collectively\n\nsuggest the mechanism underlying the Rps7 phenotype is TRP53\n\nactivation followed by TRP53-mediated apoptosis.\n\nWhile these data suggest that RP mutant phenotypes may all be\n\nattributed to alterations in RP\u2014TRP53 interactions, the variabil-\n\nity among RP phenotypes suggests more complexity, potentially as\n\na result of RP gene-specific or cell-specific functions [55]. Tissue-\n\nspecific effects of mutations in different RPs have been observed in\n\nzebrafish [4], mouse [5,6] and human [11]. These apparently\n\ntissue-specific phenotypes could simply be due to incomplete\n\nphenotypic characterization, differing severity of hypomorphic\n\nalleles, and/or differing genetic backgrounds. However, if they\n\ntruly reflect tissue-specific RP functions, one explanation could be\n\ndifferences in the relative expression levels of individual RPs, with\n\na consequent differential sensitivity to RP insufficiency that could\n\nvary with tissue type, developmental stage or differentiation state.\n\nIndeed, remarkable heterogeneity in RP mRNA levels has been\n\nobserved in a variety of tissues [56] including specifically during\n\nmouse embryonic development [47] and human neuronal\n\ndifferentiation [57].\n\nA cell type-specific sensitivity to RP insufficiency is strongly\n\nsupported by the observation that keratinocyte-specific Rps6\n\nhemizygosity causes hyperpigmentation while melanocyte-specific\n\nRps6 hemizygosity instead causes hypopigmentation [5]. Similarly,\n\nthe severe melanoblast reduction in Rps7 mutants could suggest a\n\nmelanocyte-specific sensitivity to RPS7 loss. Given that Sox10 and\n\nRps7 pathways interact in melanocytes in vivo (Figure S6, Figure\n\nS7), it will be interesting to determine if a melanocyte-specific\n\ntranscriptional response to RPS7 deficiency is mediated by Sox10,\n\nwhich is expressed in melanocytes but absent in keratinocytes.\n\nTRP53 activation in melanocytes has already been associated with\n\ndownregulation of another white spotting gene, Kit, which is\n\nproposed as a transcriptional target of TRP53 [7,58]. Further\n\nwork is needed in melanocytes and other cell types that display RP\n\ngene-specific phenotypes, to clarify if direct transcriptional\n\nregulation of lineage-specific genes plays a role in tissue-specific\n\nsensitivity to individual RP deficiencies.\n\nAnother explanation of tissue-specific RP phenotypes could be a\n\nfunction for individual RPs in the translation of specific mRNAs.\n\nThis is supported by studies of RPL13 [59] and by a recent study\n\nreporting patterning defects in Rpl38 mutant mouse embryos due to\n\nRPL38 translational regulation of a subset of Hox transcripts [47].\n\nThe tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7 mutants would be\n\nconsistent with a role for RPS7 in facilitating translational\n\nregulation of transcripts critical for development of the affected\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\ntissues. Alternatively, tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7\n\nmutants could be a consequence of a direct interaction between\n\nRPS7 and tissue-specific developmental regulators at the protein\n\nlevel. Interestingly, support for protein-protein interactions between\n\nRPS7 and SOX10 comes from recent evidence that RPS7 interacts\n\ndirectly with SRY, an HMG box protein related to SOX10 [60].\n\nThis mechanism of direct interaction between RPs and tissue-\n\nspecific, non-ribosomal proteins could explain tissue-specific phe-\n\nnotypes in RP mutants, and is supported by a number of studies\n\nreporting extra-ribosomal functions of specific RPs in regulation of\n\nribosome biosynthesis and binding of transcription factor complexes\n\n(reviewed in ref. [55]).\n\nThe relative contributions of these various mechanistic expla-\n\nnations for tissue-specific and gene-specific RP mutant phenotypes\n\nwill be clarified with further detailed comparison of mutants on\n\nconsistent genetic backgrounds and with additional information\n\nfrom tissue-specific conditional alleles. In summary, these novel\n\nalleles of Rps7 add to the growing collection of mammalian\n\nribosomal mutants and provide two new mouse models of a DBA-\n\nassociated gene. Importantly, the unique CNS apoptosis and\n\nbehavioral phenotypes reported here suggest that RPs need to be\n\nconsidered as candidate genes for not only DBA but also a broad\n\nspectrum of neurodevelopmental human diseases.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics statement\nAll procedures performed in the UK were in accordance with\n\nthe UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and those\n\nperformed in the United States were approved by the IACUC in\n\naccordance with NIH guidelines.\n\nMice\nMontu mice were identified in a screen where BALB/c male mice\n\nwere mutagenized using ENU and crossed to C3H/He for\n\nscreening. Zuma mice were identified in an ENU screen sensitized\n\nby Sox10 haploinsufficiency (Sox10LacZ/+), where BALB/cJ mice\n\nwere mutagenized using ENU and crossed to C57Bl/6J mice for\n\nfurther pedigree analysis. Trp53 null mice (B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Tyj/J,\n\nstock #002101) were purchased from JAX Mice. For behavioral\nstudies, mice were housed in facilities with a 12:12 light:dark cycle at\n\na temperature of 2261uC with a 60\u201370% humidity. Upon weaning,\nmice were separated into single-sex littermate groups and food was\n\navailable ad libitum.\n\nFor body weight analysis, each gender/genotype group\n\nrepresented in Figure 1B was weighed over 10 weeks (average\n\nN = 9 for each Figure 1B data point, range N = 2\u201319). A Student\u2019s\n\nt-test was used to compare wild-type to mutant within gender-\n\nmatched groups at each age. Significance was assessed using the\n\nBonferonni method to correct for multiple testing, with p,0.001\n\ndeemed significant. In females, all time points after 1 week were\n\nsignificantly different and in males all time points after 2 weeks\n\nwere significantly different, with the exception of 8.5 weeks where\n\nonly 2 mutant mice were weighed (p,0.003).\n\nAlizarin red and alcian blue staining of skeletons was conducted\n\nusing standard techniques. Briefly, embryos were skinned and\n\neviscerated, fixed 24 hours in ethanol, then fixed 24 hours in\n\nacetone. Staining was performed for 3\u20134 hours at 37uC and then\n3\u20134 days at room temperature. After staining, embryos were\n\nrinsed in water and cleared in 1% KOH for 3 hours at room\n\ntemperature and moved to fresh 1% KOH overnight. After\n\nclearing, embryos were serially transferred through 20%/1%\n\nKOH, 50% glycerol/1% KOH, and 80% glycerol/1% KOH.\n\nFACS analysis was completed using standard techniques.\n\nBriefly, fetal liver samples were collected in ice cold PBS and\n\ndispersed into a single cell suspension with passage through a 21\n\ngauge needle. Samples were incubated for 20 minutes with the\n\naddition of 10 ml of each antibody (BD Parmingen Ter119-APC\nand CD71-FITC), then washed once with PBS before FACS\n\nanalysis. At each age ANOVA analysis was performed with a post-\n\nhoc test to compare selected pairs: (Rps7+/+ versus Rps7Zma/+) and\n(Rps7Zma/+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+).\n\nGenetic mapping and sequencing\nDNA was extracted from mice using standard techniques. For\n\nMtu, the mutation was mapped using 11 affected animals and 51\n\npolymorphic MIT makers that were amplified by PCR and\n\nvisualized on a 4% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.\n\nFine mapping was performed with 13 additional SNPs that\n\ndistinguished between BALB/c and 101. Seventeen known and\n\npredicted genes were identified in the Mtu critical interval from the\n\nEnsembl database (ENSMUSG00000020633, ENSMUSG00\n\n000066544, ENSMUSG00000020636, ENSMUSG00000036655,\n\nENSMUSG00000061477, ENSMUSG00000020630, ENSMU-\n\nSG00000020629, ENSMUSG00000020628, ENSMUSG0000\n\n0036613, ENSMUSG00000061911, ENSMUSG00000020674,\n\nENSMUSG00000020673, ENSMUSG00000020672, ENSMU-\n\nSG00000043061, ENSMUSG00000044573, ENSMUSG00000\n\n020669, ENSMUSG00000036136). All exons and adjacent splice\n\nsites for these 17 genes were sequenced using a BigDye dideoxy-\n\nterminator system and analyzed on an ABI3700 sequencer\n\n(Applied Biosystems). For Zma, DNA from 8 offspring was\n\nanalyzed using the Illumina GoldenGate assay medium density\n\nlinkage panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The addition of 24\n\nmicrosatellite markers, from 4 regions with suggestive linkage (Chr\n\n4, 6, 12, 17) in 8 additional affected mice, allowed localization to\n\nchromosome 12 (D12Mit182 -D12Mit60). Rps7 was sequenced as\n\na candidate gene using the same methods as for Mtu.\n\nCellular studies and Western blots\nmRNA was extracted from wild-type and Rps7Mtu/+ brains, and\n\ncDNA was prepared using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A\n\nhigh fidelity PCR polymerase (KOD, Novagen) was then\n\nemployed to amplify the Rps7 transcript encoding a fusion protein\n\ntagged at either the C- or N-terminus with a FLAG epitope, prior\n\nto cloning into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Constructs were\ntransfected into HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips, before\n\nfixation and staining 48 hours later. The primary antibody\n\nemployed was a rabbit anti-FLAG (Abcam, ab21536, 1:1000),\n\nfollowed by a fluorescent secondary (1:200, Molecular Probes).\n\nFive independent transfections were performed. Images were\n\ncaptured on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.\n\nFor Western blot experiments, DNA constructs encoding wild-\n\ntype RPS7, RPS7 p.V156G, and RPS7 p.Y177S fused to the\n\nFLAG epitope at the N- or C-terminus were used in transient\n\ntransfection experiments in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293\n\ncells. Neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) expressed by the\n\ncloning vector pcDNA3.1 was used as a control for transfection\n\nefficiency. After transfection, proteins were separated on a 12%\n\nSDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose Protran membrane\n\n(Schleicher and Schuell) and incubated with a rabbit anti-FLAG\n\nor anti-neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) antibody for 1 hr.\n\nFollowing three consecutive washes in PBS/Tween, the mem-\n\nbrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat\n\nanti-rabbit Ab (Jackson Immunoresearch) and visualized using a\n\nchemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and a LAS3000 Image\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nSystem (Fuji). Equal loading was checked by Ponceau-S red\n\nstaining of the membranes before Western blot analysis.\n\nRibosomal analysis\nFor Northern blots for rRNA processing, RNA was extracted\n\nfrom mouse tissues with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol. Total RNA was fractionated on formal-\n\ndehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Gene Screen Plus\n\nmembrane (NEN). To detect rRNA precursor transcripts, ITS1\n\nprobe was prepared by 59 end-labeling of a 28-mer oligonucleotide\n\n(GCTCCTCCACAGTCTCCCGTTAATGATC) with 25 mCi of\nc [32P]-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standard\nprotocols. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42uC in 66\nSSPE, 1% SDS, 0.25 mg/ml ssDNA and 56Denhardt\u2019s solution.\nAfter hybridization, the blot was washed twice with 1% SDS in 26\nSSPE for 30 min at 37uC. Quantitation of signals was obtained by\nphosphor screen scanning with a STORM PhosphorImager and\n\nImageQuant software analysis (Molecular Dynamics). The exper-\n\niments were performed on tissues from Rps7+/+ and Rps7Mtu/+\nlittermate mice (2 Rps7+/+ and 2 Rps7Mtu/+ for liver, 3 Rps7+/+\nand 3 Rps7Mtu/+ for brain, each in triplicate). Quantitation is\nreported as the ratio between 30S and 21S rRNA precursors and\n\nwas significantly different between genotypes in both brain\n\n(p,0.01) and liver (p,0.01) (two-way ANOVA with post hoc t-\n\ntest).\n\nFor ribosome isolation, cytoplasmic extracts from RPS7\n\np.V156G transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated\n\nthrough ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion. After 2 hours of\n\ncentrifugation at 100,000 g, ribosomes and ribosomal subunits\n\nwere recovered in the pellet and free cytoplasmic proteins were\n\nrecovered from the supernatant.\n\nFor sucrose gradients separating polysomes and ribosomal\n\nsubunits, cytoplasmic extracts from Mtu/+ liver were loaded onto a\n10%\u201330% linear sucrose gradient containing 30 mM Tris-HCl\n\n(pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. Gradients were\n\ncentrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 5 hr at 37,000 rpm and\n\nthen the absorbance profile of the gradient was used to evaluate\n\nthe ratio between the peaks of ribosomal subunits (60S and 40S).\n\nIn situ hybridization\nFor whole mount, Pmel17-containing plasmid (Riken cDNA\n\nclone G370069C13; GenBank Acc: BB766987) was digested with\n\nKpn1 and transcribed with T3 polymerase to generate DIG-\n\nlabeled in situ probes. Hybridizations were performed using\n\npublished protocols [61] with the following modifications. After\n\nprobe hybridization, Ribonuclease A digestion was omitted, and\n\nTris-buffered saline was used in place of PBS. BM-purple substrate\n\n(Roche, Molecular Biochemicals) was used in place of 5-bromo-4-\n\nchloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium. Embryos were\n\nphotographed using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V12 microscope\n\nwith a Zeiss AxioCam camera. Probes to detect Rps7 by in situ\n\nhybridization were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCRII-\n\nTOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the following primer pairs:\n\nR7_IN_F AAGGAAATCGAAGTTGGTG and R7_IN_ R\n\nAATTAACATCCTTGCCTGTG. Mouse embryos were fixed\n\nin 2\u20134% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 30% (w/v)\n\nsucrose in phosphate buffer before sectioning (10\u201320 mm) on a\ncryostat. In situ hybridization was carried out as previously\n\ndescribed [62]. Briefly, hybridization of sections with 35S-UTP-\n\nlabeled RNA probes was carried out in a 50% (v/v) formamide\n\nsolution at 60uC. Sections were washed in 50% (v/v) formamide,\nan RNAse A treatment was performed for 30 min at 37uC, and\nthen successively stringent SSC solution washes were performed,\n\nwith a final wash at 0.16 SSC at 60uC.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nFor Nissl staining, adult mice were perfused with 0.9% NaCl\n\nand 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde before the brain was dehydrated\n\nin 30% sucrose, sectioned (40 mm) on a freezing microtome, and\nstained.. For embryonic histology, embryos were fixed in either\n\nBouin\u2019s fixative or 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, washed\n\nextensively in PBS, and dehydrated in 70% ethanol before\n\nsectioning (5\u20137 mm paraffin) and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)\nstaining. For immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed in 4%\n\nparaformaldehyde overnight, washed with PBS, dehydrated in\n\n10% sucrose followed by 20% sucrose, then embedded in Neg-50\n\n(Thermo Scientific) for cryosectioning (14 mm). Antibodies includ-\ned anti-TRP53 (Leica NCL-p53-CM5p, 1:200), anti-CC3 (Cell\n\nSignaling #9661, 1:200), and anti-PH3 (Millipore #06-570,\n1:200) and resulting stains were imaged using a Zeiss Observer.D1\n\nmicroscope. For apoptosis and proliferation experiments, trans-\n\nverse cryo-sections collected at the level of the forelimb from 3\n\nembryos of each genotype, 6 sections per embryo, were counted\n\nfor CC3+ and PH3+ cells. InStat software (GraphPad Software,\nInc.) was used for one-way ANOVA statistical analysis. No\n\nsignificant difference among the three genotypes was observed in\n\nPH3+ cell counts (p = 0.902). CC3 counts were significantly\ndifferent among genotypes (p = 0.0005) and a Tukey-Kramer\n\nmultiple comparison post test was used for pairwise comparison\n\namong all genotypes with the following results: Rps7+/+ versus\nRps7Zma/+ (p,0.001), Rps7+/+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+\n(P.0.05, no significant difference), Rps7Zma/+ versus Rps7Zma/+;\nTrp53KO/+ (p,0.01).\n\nBehavioral phenotyping\nBehavioral phenotyping was performed on mutant and unaf-\n\nfected sex-matched littermates between 8 and 12 weeks of age.\n\nOpen-field tests were conducted for 5 minutes in a brightly lit,\n\n60 cm diameter, enclosed white arena (field), and monitored by an\n\nautomated tracking system to measure the total distance travelled\n\nand the amount of time spent in the center versus the border of the\n\nfield. The elevated plus maze test was conducted with an elevated\n\nplatform consisting of two enclosed arms and two open arms. An\n\nautomated tracking system was employed to measure the number\n\nof entries into each arm and distance traveled in open and closed\n\narms of the elevated plus maze over 5 minutes. Spontaneous\n\nalternation was performed in an enclosed T-maze built from gray\n\nplastic (arm dimensions 30 cm610 cm630 cm). Each mouse\nunderwent 10 trials with an inter-trial interval of at least\n\n20 minutes. For each trial the mouse was placed in the start\n\narm facing the end wall and allowed to enter a goal arm of its own\n\nchoice. The mouse was confined in the goal arm for 30 seconds\n\nand then put back in the start arm and allowed a free choice of\n\neither arm [31].\n\nMRM imaging\nLate gestation (E18.5) embryos were collected, fixed in 4%\n\nparaformaldehyde overnight, washed extensively in PBS, and\n\nstored in 70% ethanol. Prior to imaging, embryos were rehydrated\n\nin a solution of PBS and 0.5% (v/v) Magnevist (Bayer Healthcare\n\nPharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ), a contrast agent. MRM was\n\nperformed on specimens using a Bruker 14.1T MR imaging\n\nspectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) using a multi-echo\n\nRARE technique [63] with TR/TE = 200/6.9 ms, 8-echoes, and\n\n4 signal averages. The resulting 3D images were acquired in\n\n53 min with an acquisition resolution of 50 microns isotropic.\n\nManual segmentation of the whole brain and 10 major anatomical\n\nregions was performed using Amira visualization software (v5.2.2,\n\nVisage Imaging Inc., Andover MA, USA) with guidance from an\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nanatomical reference atlas [64]. The volume of these regions was\n\nestimated and 3D rendering with smoothing was performed to\n\ngenerate 3D representations. Student\u2019s t-tests were used to\n\ncompare volumes of each Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ brain region.\nSignificance was assessed using the Bonferonni method to correct\n\nfor multiple testing, with p,0.005 deemed significant.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Montu and zuma map to mouse Chromosome 12 and\n\ncause a variety of phenotypes.

(A) The amino acid residues altered by the Rps7Mtu and\n\nRps7Zma mutations are highly conserved across a wide range of\n\nspecies. Green highlight indicates the location of p.V156 and\n\np.Y177, and red font indicates non-identical residues. (B)\n\nAlignments of secondary structure predictions indicate that the\n\nRps7Mtu and Rps7Zma mouse alleles cause no gross structural\n\nchanges in RPS7 as a result of the encoded amino acid alterations.\n\nThe experimentally determined secondary structures of yeast (S.\n\ncerevisiae) and tetrahymena (T. thermophila) RPS7 orthologs (PDB ID\n\n3U5C and PDB ID 2XZM, respectively) are aligned with\n\nsecondary structure predictions of the S. cerevisiae, T. thermophila,\n\nand mouse RPS7, RPS7Mtu and Rps7Zma proteins (generated with\n\nboth PSSpred and PROFsec). In the predictions, numbers indicate\n\nreliability scores ranging from low (0) to high (9). Residues\n\npredicted as helix and strand are highlighted in blue and gray,\n\nrespectively.

A similar fraction of\n\nall transfected RPS7 proteins is observed in the ribosomal pellet (P)\n\ncompared to the supernatant (S). (C) Polysomal profiles of liver\n\ncytoplasmic extracts. After ultracentrifugation, the Optical Density\n\nat 260 nm was measured along the sucrose gradient. Ratio\n\nbetween 60S and 40S peaks in Rps7Mtu/+ is similar to control. The\nslight variation in 80S peak relative height is not significant as it is\n\nwithin the variability observed between samples, independent of\n\ngenotype.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S4 Embryonic developmental delay in Rps7Zma/+ mice is\nsuppressed by Trp53 deficiency. Chronologically age-matched\n\nlittermate embryos illustrate that Rps7Zma/+ mice exhibit devel-\nopmental delay at E11.5 and E12.5 relative to Rps7+/+ littermates\n(left 4 panels). This Rps7Zma-associated developmental delay is\n\nsuppressed by Trp53 deficiency in Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ (right 4\npanels). Images for each of the 4 genotypes are shown at the same\n\nmagnification within an age (row).\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S5 Pmel17 expression is reduced at E12.5 in Rps7 mutant\n\nembryos. Comparison of Pmel17 in situ hybridizations of E12.5\n\nRps7Zma/+ embryos (middle 3 panels) with E12.5 Rps7+/+\nembryos (left 3 panels) showed that Rps7Zma/+ embryos exhibit a\nsevere reduction in melanoblasts. Furthermore, melanoblast\n\nnumber in E12.5 Rps7Zma/+ embryos was reduced below that of\nE11.5 Rps7+/+ embryos (right 3 panels), thus showing that the\nmelanoblast reduction in Rps7Zma/+ embryos exceeds the gross\ndevelopmental delay observed in Rps7Zma/+ mutants. This\nreduction is especially evident from comparison of E12.5\n\nRps7Zma/+ and E11.5 Rps7+/+ melanoblast populations in the\notic area (arrows), in the trunk posterior to the forelimb (*), and in\n\nthe tail region (arrowheads). Scale bars = 1 mm.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S6 Mutation of Rps7 and Sox10 act synergistically to\n\nreduce melanoblast number. Combined haploinsufficiency for\n\nRps7 and Sox10 (Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes)\ngreatly reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (middle 3 panels)\n\nas compared to E12.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+mice (left 3 panels).\nFurthermore, E12.5 Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice showed a\ngreater reduction in melanoblast number in comparison with\n\nE11.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice, indicating that this reduction\nin melanoblasts exceeded the gross developmental delay observed\n\nin Rps7Zma/+ mutants. Reduction is especially evident in\nmelanoblast populations in the otic area (arrow), and in the tail\n\nregion posterior to the hindlimb (arrowhead and posterior). Scale\n\nbars = 1 mm.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S7 Rps7 mutation increases Sox10-dependent hypopig-\n\nmentation and does not result in dark skin. (A, B) Rps7Zma/+;\nSox10LacZ/+ double mutants that survive postnatally exhibit\nmore extensive hypopigmentation than Rps7Zma/+or Sox10-\nLacZ/+ mutants. A representative Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mouse\nis shown (A) along with quantitative scoring (0 = no spotting;\n\n4 = the largest ventral spots that extend to the dorsal surface)\n\ncomparing the white spotting in Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+ (blue,\nN = 27), Rps7Zma/+; Sox10+/+ (red, N = 16), and Rps7Zma/+;\nSox10LacZ/+ (yellow, N = 8) (B). (C, D) Adult Rps7 mutants do\nnot have dark skin in foot pads and tails. (E,F) H&E stained\n\nsections through the tail skin of Rps7Zma/+ mice reveal\nepidermal (*) and dermal (arrowhead) pigmentation similar to\n\nthat of Rps7+/+ mice, confirming the presence of melanocytes\nin the tail.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S8 Behavioral assessment of Rps7Mtu/+ mutants. (A)\nTotal distance traveled in the open-field test by Rps7+/+ controls\n(WT) and Rps7Mtu/+ (Mtu) (N = 11) was similar (p = 0.5). (B\u2013E)\nLikewise there were no significant differences between Rps7+/+\nand Rps7Mtu/+ on the elevated plus maze. Open arm distance (B,\nP.0.5), open arm entries (C, P.0.5), closed arm distance (D,\n\nP.0.5), and closed arm entries (E, P.0.1) were all comparable\n\n(N = 11).\n\n(TIF)\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 15 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nFigure S9 Rps7 mutants have pyknotic nuclei in the spinal cord.\n\nH&E stained sagittal sections through the spinal cord of E18.5\n\nRps7+/+ (A, B) and Rps7Zma/+ (C, D) embryos.

Sorenson,a Karen F. Ross,a,b Mark C. Herzberga,b\n\nDepartment of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USAa; Mucosal and Vaccine Research Center,\nMinneapolis VA Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USAb\n\nTo protect against invading bacteria, oral epithelial cells appear to use two effector antimicrobial peptides (AMPs): calprotectin\n(S100A8-S100A9 heterodimer [S100A8/A9]) in the cytosol and cathelicidin antimicrobial protein (CAMP) in endosomes. We\nsought to learn whether innate immunity might be augmented benignly to increase resistance against invasive bacteria. Epithe-\nlial cells were transiently transfected with mRNA constructs containing either the CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 open reading\nframes, A8-IRES-A9 (fusion sequence), or A8-nIRES-A9 (fusion with native internal ribosome entry site [IRES] sequence).\nCAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 protein levels generally peaked between 16 and 44 h after mRNA transfection, depending on the\nconstruct; CAMP was processed to LL-37 over time. Following transfection with the respective mRNAs, CAMP and S100A8/A9\neach independently increased resistance of epithelial cells to invasion by Listeria and Salmonella for up to 48 h; tandem\nS100A8/A9 constructs were also effective. Cotransfection to express S100A8/A9 and CAMP together augmented resistance, but\nsynergy was not seen. Independent of the new proteins produced, transfection reduced cell viability after 48 h by 20%, with only\n2% attributable to apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that epithelial cell resistance to invasive pathogens can be\naugmented by transient transfection of antimicrobial mRNAs into epithelial cells.\n\nMucosal epithelia provide the first line of defense against theinvasion of microbes. Indeed, epithelial cells offer both a\nphysical barrier and molecular-based antimicrobial resistance in\nthe absence of any assistance from the mucosal immune system.\nUsing a cell-autonomous mechanism to confer resistance to in-\nvading bacteria, epithelial innate immunity is provided by endog-\nenous expression of effector antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), in-\ncluding cathelicidin antimicrobial protein (CAMP) and its active\nproteolytic cleavage product (LL-37), calprotectin (S100A8 com-\nplexed to S100A9 [S100A8/A9]), \ufffd-defensins, S100A7, secretory\nleukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), lipocalin 2 (LCN2), and ly-\nsozyme (1, 2). Most antimicrobial peptides/proteins function pri-\nmarily outside eukaryotic cells, often with proinflammatory and\nother off-target effects. Upon secretion or release from eukaryotic\ncells, the antimicrobial peptides can interact and antagonize mi-\ncroorganisms, usually by membrane intercalation and internal-\nization to localize with subcellular microbial targets. Of these an-\ntimicrobial peptides/proteins, only CAMP (LL-37) (3) and, as we\nhave shown, S100A8/A9 (4\u20136) are known to function within epi-\nthelial cells to inhibit bacterial invasion.\n\nHuman CAMP is a member of a large family of cationic anti-\nmicrobial peptides, expressed in many species, that have broad-\nspectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses\nand also show immunomodulatory effects (7). Following excision\nof the signal peptide, human cathelicidin precursor protein\n(hCAP18), encoded by CAMP, is commonly stored in neutrophil\ngranules. Activation of hCAP18 is controlled by the serine pro-\nteases stratum corneum tryptic enzyme (SCTE; kallikrein 5) and\nstratum corneum chymotryptic protease (SCCE; kallikrein 7) (8).\nAfter processing, the 37-residue active peptide (LL-37) mediates a\nwide range of biological responses, such as direct killing of micro-\norganisms, chemotaxis and chemokine induction, regulation of\ninflammatory responses, and adjuvant, angiogenic, and wound-\nhealing effects (9). LL-37 appears to be directly antimicrobial in\nthe phagolysosomes of neutrophils and macrophages and at sites\n\nof acute inflammation (9), showing broad-spectrum antimicro-\nbial activity against Listeria monocytogenes (10), Salmonella en-\nterica serovar Typhimurium (11), and Streptococcus groups A, B,\nand C (12).\n\nCAMP expression can be induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin\nD3 (13), pathogens (9), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14). De-\ncreased CAMP/LL-37 production accompanies increased inva-\nsion and colonization by pathogens in epithelial cells, which char-\nacterizes diseases such as morbus Kostmann (15) and atopic\ndermatitis (16).\n\nCalprotectin is a heterodimeric complex of calcium-binding\nproteins S100A8 (MRP8 or calgranulin A; 10.8 kDa) and S100A9\n(MRP14 or calgranulin B; 13.2 kDa) (6). S100A8 and S100A9 are\nmembers of the S100 family of proteins (17). S100 family mem-\nbers are characterized by their two EF-hand calcium-binding mo-\ntifs; these proteins are involved in cell growth, cell differentiation,\ncell cycle progression, cell survival, protein phosphorylation, tran-\nscription, cancer development, and inflammatory diseases (18).\nCalprotectin shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against\nCandida albicans and bacteria, including Capnocytophaga sputi-\ngena, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocy-\ntogenes, S. Typhimurium, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (4, 6, 19\u2013\n21). After stable transfection to express the calprotectin complex,\n\nReceived 2 May 2013 Returned for modification 28 June 2013\nAccepted 5 August 2013\n\nPublished ahead of print 12 August 2013\n\nEditor: B.

When expressed in the cell\nin complex with S100A8, S100A9 E36Q and E78Q mutants\nshowed increased bacterial invasion and were predicted to cause\nloss of the calcium-induced positive face in the S100A8/A9 com-\nplex (6). Some intracellular pathogens appear to have strategies to\navoid antibacterial calprotectin. To facilitate intraepithelial sur-\nvival in the cytoplasm, Listeria mobilizes calprotectin to colocalize\nwith cytoplasmic microtubules, appearing to subvert anti-Listeria\nactivity and autonomous cellular immunity (5).\n\nMucosal epithelial cells can therefore protect against and sup-\npress invasive pathogens mainly by using two intracellular anti-\nmicrobial effector systems: CAMP/LL-37, largely in endosomes\n(3, 22), and calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9), in the cytosol (6). We\nhypothesized that S100A8/A9 and CAMP can function to aug-\nment innate intraepithelial resistance to invading bacterial patho-\ngens. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel approach to\ncellular production of neoproteins, using transient delivery of spe-\ncific antimicrobial effector mRNAs (e.g., CAMP and S100A8/\nS100A9). mRNA transfections for therapeutic purposes are of\nconsiderable current interest to replace or augment expression of\nproteins through systemic or ex vivo administration (23). When\nspecifically targeted to the native source of the protein of interest,\nmRNA transfections have the potential to replace, restore, or aug-\nment innate immune effector proteins and the mucosal immune\nbarrier to infection. We now report the delivery of CAMP and\nS100A8/S100A9 mRNAs into human keratinocytes and the func-\ntional changes in resistance to bacterial invasion.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture. Human KB cells (ATCC CCL-17; American Type Culture\nCollection) were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (MEM; Mediatech\nInc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at\n37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n\nBacteria. L. monocytogenes ATCC 10403S (provided by Daniel Port-\nnoy, University of California, Berkeley, CA) and S. Typhimurium ATCC\n14028 (provided by Carol Wells, University of Minnesota) were grown in\nbrain heart infusion medium (Difco) and on tryptic soy agar (Difco) at\n37\u00b0C. Listeria and Salmonella cells were harvested from log phase and\nstationary phase, respectively, at an absorbance at 620 nm of 0.4 to 0.6,\nand used to infect KB cells.\n\nPlasmid construction. The open reading frame (ORF) for EGFP (see\nFig. S2 in the supplemental material) and ORFs containing Kozak se-\nquences for human CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 (all primer pairs are\nlisted in Table S1) were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were cloned\ninto pGEM4Z.2bgUTR.150A (24) (provided by C. H. June and Y. Zhao,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania) via NotI and HindIII sites. To create a single\nmRNA for transcription, the S100A8 ORF containing a Kozak sequence\nwas cloned into the first multiple-cloning site (MCS) of the pIRES vector\n(Clontech, Mountain View, CA) via NheI and XhoI sites; the S100A9\nORF was cloned into the second MCS of the pIRES vector via XbaI and\nNotI sites. Amplified A8-IRES-A9 fragments were also cloned into\npGEM4Z.2bgUTR.150A to generate the plasmid pGEM4Z.A8-IRES-\nA9.2bgUTR.150A.\n\nThe internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the pIRES vector is a par-\ntially disabled sequence (25, 26). To construct the native IRES (nIRES),\npGEM4Z.A8-IRES-A9.2bgUTR.150A was used as a template and ampli-\nfied with primers 5= AAA CGT CTA GGC CCC CCG AAC C 3= and 5= TTT\n\nAAC CTC GAC TAA ACA CAT GTA AAG CAT GTG C 3=. The product\nwas purified and self-ligated to generate plasmid pGEM4Z.A8-IRES/\nmut1-A9.2bgUTR.150A. Primers 5= ACC ATG ACT TGC AAA ATG TCG\nCAG CTG 3= and 5= ATT ATC ATC GTG TTT TTC AAA GGA AAA CCA\nC 3= were used to amplify a fragment from pGEM4Z.S100A8-IRES/mut1-\nS100A9.2bgUTR as the template. The fragments were purified and self-\nligated to generate plasmid pGEM4Z.A8-nIRES-A9.2bgUTR.150A.\n\nIn vitro transcription. Templates were amplified from corresponding\nplasmid constructs and extracted from gels. Purified fragments were\ntreated with 0.5% SDS and 100 \ufffdg/ml protease K at 50\u00b0C for 30 min and\nthen extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and\nthen with chloroform. After ethanol precipitation, templates were dis-\nsolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl and stored at \ufffd80\u00b0C. Using an mMESSAGE\nmMACHINE T7 Ultra kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) or a\nScriptCap m7G capping system/ScriptCap 2=-O-methyltransferase kit\n(Cell Script, Madison, WI), mRNAs were synthesized and then purified\nusing a MEGAclear kit (Life Technologies) followed by ethanol precipi-\ntation.\n\nmRNA transfections. At approximately 60 to 90% confluence, cells\nwere transfected with mRNAs by using the TransIT-mRNA kit reagent\n(Mirus Biol LLC, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions.\n\nqRT-PCR. See the supplemental material for details on quantitative\nreal-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.\n\nWestern blot analysis. Cells were extracted using mammalian cell-PE\nLBTM buffer (GBiosciences, Maryland Heights, MO). The extracted pro-\nteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-\nbranes, and incubated with one of the following: rabbit anti-\ufffd-actin\n(DB070; Delta Biolabs, Gilroy, CA), mouse anti-LL37 (sc-166770; Santa\nCruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-S100A8 (sc-48352; Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology), rabbit anti-S100A9 (sc-20173; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or\nrabbit anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (anti-PARP) (9542S; Cell Sig-\nnaling). Rabbit primary antibodies were then incubated with horseradish\nperoxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, whereas\nmouse primary antibodies were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat an-\nti-mouse antibodies (secondary antibodies) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\nImmunoreactions were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemilu-\nminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and exposed to\nAmersham Hyperfilm ECL film (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway,\nNJ). Protein bands were quantified by Quantity One analysis (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA).\n\nImmunofluorescence. See the supplemental material for details on\nimmunofluorescence.\n\nBacterial invasion assay. Bacterial invasion was determined by the\nantibiotic protection assay (6). Briefly, KB cells (1 \ufffd 105 to 1.2 \ufffd 105 cells)\nwere seeded overnight in 24-well plates. Cells were then incubated with L.\nmonocytogenes ATCC 10403S or S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 at a mul-\ntiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100:1 or 1:1, respectively. After 2 h of incu-\nbation, the monolayers were washed with Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered\nsaline (DPBS) (Sigma) and incubated for 1.5 h in MEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS containing 100 \ufffdg/ml gentamicin (Sigma), and cells were\nlysed by incubation with sterile distilled water for 15 min. Released bac-\nteria were diluted, plated with a spiral plater (Spiral Biotech, Bethesda,\nMD), and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, and then the number of CFU of\nintracellular bacteria was enumerated on a New Brunswick C-110 colony\ncounter (New Brunswick, NJ).\n\nIn vitro toxicity assay. The toxic effects of mRNA delivery in vitro\nwere analyzed by quantitatively determining cell viability using a 3-(4,5-\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (in\nvitro toxicity assay kit; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, MTT solution (5\nmg/ml) was added to each well in an amount equal to 10% of the culture\nmedium volume.

Cells were also analyzed by flow cytom-\netry using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis de-\ntection kit (MBL International Corp., Watertown, MA) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. For both analyses of apoptosis, cells\nwere harvested by trypsinization at times up to 72 h following transfection\nand then washed with 2.5% FBS in PBS. Cells harvested for detection of\nannexin by flow cytometry were incubated with annexin V-FITC plus\npropidium iodide in binding buffer at room temperature for 5 min in the\ndark. A total of 50,000 events were counted using a Becton, Dickinson\nFACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and the\npercentage of annexin V-FITC-positive cells (considered apoptotic [27])\nwas analyzed with CellQuest software, placing the FITC signal in FL1 and\nthe propidium iodide signal in FL2.\n\nStatistical analysis. Statistical comparisons were done with Student\u2019s\nt test for comparisons between two groups or with one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test for multiple\ncomparisons, using Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).\n\nRESULTS\nOptimizing mRNA stability. Capping at the 5= end of mRNA\nenhances the stability of the expressed message. An anti-reverse\ncap analogue (ARCA) can cap at an efficacy of up to 80%, whereas\nthe capping enzyme (CE) can increase the capping efficiency to\n100% (25). To optimize the capping strategy, we compared the\nmMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra system (Life Technologies),\nwhich generates ARCA-capped mRNA, with the mScript RNA\nsystem (Cell Script), which uses the 2=-O-methyltransferase CE to\ngenerate a cap 0 or cap 1, depending on the addition of a methyl\ngroup at the 2=-O position of the penultimate (5= end) nucleotide\nof the transcript. CAMP mRNAs were synthesized using the dif-\nferent capping systems and delivered into KB cells, and protein\nexpression was detected by Western blot analysis. Eight, 24, and 48\nh after transfection with ARCA-capped mRNAs, KB cells ex-\npressed more CAMP protein than that after transfection with CE\ncap 1, which was higher than that after transfection with CE cap 0\n(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). ARCA capping was\nthen used for all experiments. To determine whether the lengths of\n3= poly(A) tails increased mRNA stability, we compared mRNAs\nwith 64-A and 150-A 3= extensions. The 150-A mRNAs showed a\nslightly longer half-life (not significant; data not shown). We used\n150-A mRNA for all subsequent experiments. CAMP protein lev-\nels peaked at about 16 h and decreased by about 50% 40 to 48 h\nafter ARCA-capped mRNA delivery (Fig. 1). CAMP was hydro-\nlyzed to LL-37, and levels peaked from 24 to 48 h after mRNA\ntransfection (Fig. 1). LL-37 appeared as the presence of CAMP was\nreduced.\n\nStability of mRNAs capped with ARCA. KB cells were used\nbecause they express CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 mRNAs below\nthe level of detection (data not shown). Therefore, endogenous\nS100A8, S100A9, and CAMP mRNAs expressed in KB cells con-\ntributed little to levels after transfection with ARCA-capped\nmRNAs. To synthesize a fusion mRNA containing S100A8 and\nS100A9, the S100A8 ORF containing a Kozak sequence was cloned\ninto pIRES MCS A, and S100A9 was cloned into MCS B. To elim-\ninate the attenuation of downstream translation with pIRES, na-\ntive IRES (nIRES) was constructed and inserted between the\nS100A8 and S100A9 ORFs. Sequences containing all necessary el-\nements were cloned into pGEM4Z.2bgUTR.150A, and then A8-\nIRES-A9 and A8-nIRES-A9 mRNAs were synthesized. Transfec-\ntion of in vitro-transcribed ARCA-capped CAMP, S100A8,\n\nS100A9, A8-IRES-A9, and A8-nIRES-A9 mRNAs was analyzed us-\ning qRT-PCR (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Four\nhours after each mRNA transfection, we first measured the intra-\ncellular mRNA levels. Sixteen to 20 h following transfection, the\nCAMP mRNA levels were approximately half that at 4 h, indicat-\ning that the half-life in KB cells was between 12 and 16 h (see Fig.\nS2A). In contrast, cotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs\nresulted in mRNA half-lives of between 12 and 16 h and 8 to 12 h,\nrespectively (see Fig. S2B). When the tandem mRNAs were trans-\nfected, the half-life of A8-IRES-A9 was 12 to 16 h, whereas that of\nA8-nIRES-A9 mRNA was between 8 and 12 h (see Fig. S2C and D).\n\nCotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9 increases stability of\neach protein. After delivery into KB cells, ARCA-capped mRNAs\nfor S100A8 (Fig. 2A), S100A9 (Fig. 2B), and calprotectin (1:1\n[mol/mol] S100A8 plus S100A9) (Fig. 2C) were compared for pro-\ntein expression. Expression of S100A8 protein alone was maximal\nat 16 h and decreased by about half at about 28 h (Fig. 2A),\nwhereas expression of S100A9 protein was maximized at 16 h and\ndecreased to half at about 40 to 48 h (Fig. 2B). The stability of each\npeptide appeared to increase after S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs\n(half the amount of each compared to transfections with either\nS100A8 or S100A9 mRNA) were cotransfected. Compared to\nS100A8 protein after transfection with S100A8 mRNA, for exam-\nple (Fig. 2D), S100A8/A9 was more sustained over time after\ncotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs (Fig. 2C). When\nS100A8 mRNA was cotransfected with S100A9 mRNA, S100A8\nprotein expression was maximized at 24 h and decreased by half at\nabout 72 h (Fig. 2C). Under the same conditions, S100A9 protein\nexpression was also maximized at 24 h and decreased to half at\nabout 48 to 72 h (Fig. 2D). Cotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9\nmRNAs led to increased stability of each peptide, suggesting that\nthe formation of spontaneous calprotectin heterodimers pro-\nmotes resistance to degradation.\n\nS100A8/S100A9 protein expression using tandem con-\nstructs.

For A8-nIRES-A9\nmRNA transfection, expression of S100A8 protein was maximal at\n16 h and decreased to half at 24 to 32 h (Fig. 2F and G), whereas\nS100A9 protein expression was maximal at 40 h and decreased to\nhalf at about 40 to 48 h (Fig. 2F and G). As when S100A8 was\ncoexpressed with S100A9 (Fig. 2C), use of the tandem mRNA\nconstructs generally appeared to stabilize the protein subunits\ncompared with just S100A8 mRNA transfection (Fig. 2A).\n\nIntracellular presentation of CAMP and calprotectin. Fol-\nlowing mRNA transfections, CAMP and calprotectin (neopro-\nteins) were also detected in KB cells by use of immunofluorescence\n(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Endogenous or back-\nground CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 protein levels were at or\nbelow the limits of detection, and fluorescence above background\nwas not detected with mock transfections (see Fig. S3). Sixteen\nhours after delivery of mRNAs for EGFP, CAMP, or calprotectin\n(S100A8/S100A9), significant fluorescence was detected, suggest-\ning that mRNA delivery increases enhanced green fluorescent\nprotein (EGFP), CAMP, and calprotectin protein expression (see\nFig. S3A to C). Sixteen hours after transfection with A8-IRES-A9\nand A8-nIRES-A9 mRNAs, no significant fluorescence was de-\ntected (see Fig. S3D). Forty hours following mRNA transfection,\nhowever, fluorescence signals for calprotectin were detected (see\nFig. S3E). These results are consistent with the results of Western\nblot analysis (Fig. 1 and 2E and F). The tandem constructs con-\ntained fewer molar equivalents of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs\nthan those with S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA cotransfection, but\nthey may be as effective.\n\nCAMP or calprotectin mRNA transfection increases resis-\ntance of KB cells to bacterial invasion. We determined whether\nselect antimicrobial proteins produced after mRNA transfections\n\ninto epithelial cells affected resistance to invasion by bacterial\npathogens. We determined the numbers of intracellular CFU of\nListeria and Salmonella that invaded untreated KB cells (vehicle\ncontrol) and cells treated by delivery of S100A8, S100A9, or CAMP\nmRNA (Fig. 3A). We then expressed the data as percentages of\nvehicle control levels at 8 (Fig. 3B), 24 (Fig. 3C), and 48 (Fig. 3D)\nh posttransfection to determine the effect of each mRNA treat-\nment over time. When intracellular antimicrobial proteins/pep-\ntides were present, invading bacteria were significantly reduced at\neach time point. Following transfection with all CAMP and cal-\nprotectin mRNA constructs, epithelial cell resistance to invasion\nsignificantly increased for Listeria and Salmonella at 8 h (Fig. 3A\nand B), 24 h (Fig. 3C), and 48 h (Fig. 3D). Resistance seemed to be\ngreatest 8 h after transfection. The CAMP and S100A8-plus-\nS100A9 mRNA transfection schemes appeared to increase resis-\ntance more effectively than the tandem mRNA constructs did.\n\nEffects of cotransfection with calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9)\nand CAMP mRNAs. To determine whether S100A8/A9 and\nCAMP (LL-37) function cooperatively and additively, S100A8 and\nS100A9 mRNAs (1:1 molar ratio) were cotransfected at different\nmolar ratios with CAMP mRNA. Compared to the vehicle control,\nCAMP and S100A8/A9 in all combinations caused a reduction in\nviable intracellular Listeria (Fig. 4A) and Salmonella (Fig. 4B).\nWhen CAMP and S100A8/S100A9 mRNAs were transfected at a\n1:1 molar ratio (S100A8/S100A9 at 0.5:0.5 relative to CAMP), re-\nsistance to invasion by Listeria (Fig. 4A) and Salmonella (Fig. 4B)\nwas significantly increased compared to that with S100A8/A9 or\nCAMP alone or at great excess (5:1 or 1:5 molar ratio).\n\nThe TransIT-mRNA delivery system reduces cell viability\nwithout triggering apoptosis.

Since the interiors of mucosal\nepithelial cells are not sterile, mechanisms must exist to control\nthe growth of these bacteria. The best-studied innate immune\neffector molecules, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), include the\ndefensins, CAMP (LL-37), and S100A8/A9. S100A8/A9 is ex-\npressed in the cytoplasm, and LL-37 in the endosomes, in associ-\nation with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) (6). As we have reported (5,\n6, 30), S100A8/A9 promotes functional innate immunity in the\ncytoplasm of epithelial cells by increasing resistance against invad-\ning bacteria, including Listeria and Salmonella. Functioning in the\ncytoplasm, S100A8/A9 has no signal sequence for export and gen-\nerally appears extracellularly when cells lyse. CAMP contains a\nsignal peptide, but the active LL-37 fragment does not. Hence, we\nfocused on whether S100A8/A9 and LL-37 function cooperatively\nwithin epithelial cells to attenuate the effects of invasive bacteria\n(3, 6).\n\nThe fact that these innate immune effector molecules function\nintracellularly distinguishes S100A8/A9 and LL-37 from the de-\nfensins and other AMPs that are packaged in granules and contain\nsignals for export and secretion. We show for the first time that\nepithelial cell resistance to invasive pathogens in vitro can be aug-\nmented by transient transfections using mRNAs encoding antimi-\ncrobial CAMP and calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9, A8-IRES-A9,\nand A8-nIRES-A9). S100A8/A9 and LL-37 or CAMP function in-\ndependently and additively in controlling intracellular bacteria.\nImportantly, stable presentation of S100A8/A9 and LL-37 neo-\nproteins continued for at least 72 h, with corresponding protec-\ntion against bacterial invasion.\n\nThe experimental approach using transient transfections of\nmRNAs to obtain neoprotein production is somewhat unusual,\nand this report appears to be the first in which epithelial cells are\ntargeted. We recognized that the stability of the neoproteins de-\npended on the stability of the transfected mRNAs. To optimize for\nstability, the mRNA cargo synthesized by in vitro translation was\nmodified through 5= capping with ARCA and by 3= mRNA cap-\nping using poly(A) chains in cis and in trans (31). After transfec-\ntion with ARCA-A100 Luc-mRNA, CD34-derived mouse den-\ndritic cells (JAWSII cells) showed detectable luciferase activity\nwithin 1 h, which maximized at 8 h and declined 20-fold at 30 h\n(31), whereas transfection of primary human mesenchymal stem\ncells with a CXCR4-GFP fusion mRNA resulted in CXCR4 expres-\nsion for up to 72 h and in efficient cell migration (32). To increase\nmRNA stability (33), our constructs included two sequential hu-\nman beta-globin untranslated regions (UTRs). Following trans-\nfection into KB cells, ARCA-capped CAMP, S100A8/S100A9, A8-\nIRES-A9, or A8-nIRES-A9 each showed mRNA half-lives of 8 to 16\nh (see Fig. S2A to D in the supplemental material). Our transfec-\ntions used a commercially available nonliposomal, cationic poly-\nmer-lipid formulation (TransIT-mRNA transfection kit). Clearly,\n\ncertain mRNA modifications improve the stability of the mRNA,\nbut the specific mRNA cargo, the stability of the translated pro-\ntein, and the target cell all affect the kinetics and efficiency of new\nprotein expression.\n\nAfter cotransfection with S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs,\nS100A8/A9 forms spontaneously, as seen in Fig. S3 in the supple-\nmental material. The stability of the S100A8/A9 heterodimer is\ngreater than that of the individual subunit proteins (34). Use of\ntandem constructs was similarly successful. S100A8/A9 protein\nexpression was detectable after cotransfection with S100A8 and\nS100A9 mRNAs (see Fig. S3C) and with the A8-IRES-A9 and A8-\nnIRES-A9 bicistronic transcripts (see Fig. S3E). The several con-\nstructs for S100A8/S100A9, A8-IRES-A9, and A8-nIRES-A9\nmRNAs did result in different kinetics of translation. Translation\nfrom the MCS B site insert proximal to pIRES (Fig. 2E and G) and\nnIRES (Fig. 2F and G) showed a delay. We speculate that the\nmRNAs in the MCS B site were scanned and that translation was\ninitiated by a low-efficiency, cap-independent IRES mechanism in\nKB cells.\n\nCAMP, LL-37, and calprotectin produced as neoproteins after\nmRNA transfections are expressed inside the cell (see Fig. S3 in the\nsupplemental material). S100A8, S100A9, and LL-37 all lack signal\nsequences, a membrane anchor sequence, and N-linked glyco-\nsylation consensus sequences, so they are unlikely to be secreted\nfrom the cell by a canonical pathway. We checked for release of\nS100A8/A9 and LL-37 from our cells, and the levels were below the\nlimits of detection (data not shown). Being slightly antimicrobial,\nCAMP has a signal peptide and can be secreted from the cell. We\ndid show, however, that innate intraepithelial immunity could be\naugmented through concurrent delivery of mRNAs encoding an-\ntimicrobial proteins, and we did not rigorously exclude the possi-\nbility that the effect is extracellular.\n\nTo perform our experiments, we reconciled differences in op-\ntimal cell confluence needed for the TransIT-mRNA transfection\nreagent (60 to 90%) and the antibiotic protection assay (40 to\n60%) (4, 6). For the antibiotic protection assay, cells were trans-\nfected, split 8 and 32 h later, and then incubated for another 16 h\nto reach the 40 to 60% confluence needed for bacterial invasion.\nAs expected, the apparent antimicrobial activity at 24 and 48 h was\nlower than that at 8 h following mRNA transfection (Fig. 3B to D);\ncell division over time (and subculturing) decreased intracellular\nCAMP and calprotectin protein levels. Nonetheless, the residual\nLL-37 and calprotectin levels up to 48 h after transfection were\nsufficient to provide statistically significant increases in resistance\nto the invading pathogens.\n\nCells in culture undergo apoptosis, but we found no evidence\nthat mRNA delivery of any of the cargo mRNAs or their translated\nneoprotein products, S100A8, S100A9, S100A8/A9, CAMP, and\nLL-37, affected apoptosis or cell viability. Apoptosis in untrans-\nfected and transfected cells was indistinguishable. Our observa-\ntions are consistent with previous reports using many different\ncell types and mRNA packaging systems (35, 36). To minimize the\nloss of cell viability, the delivery system may need to be modified to\nreduce epithelial cytotoxicity.

Both are directly antibacterial (3, 5, 6). S100A9\nE36Q and E78Q mutations in S100A8/A9 result in diminished\nresistance to bacterial invasion (6). S100A8/A9 also interacts with\nNADPH oxidase to activate oxidative killing in epithelial cells\n(HaCaT) (39) and neutrophils (40, 41). LL-37 also appears to\nfunction as an endosomal chaperone for bacteria and bacterial\nDNA (3), also functioning in cooperation with NADPH oxidase to\neffect intracellular killing. Since we now show that LL-37 and\nS100A8/A9 function cooperatively, we must learn how these var-\nious mechanisms are coordinated with the production of antimi-\ncrobial oxygen metabolites to control the microbial colonization\nof epithelia without causing tissue damage.\n\nSince this report shows that mRNA transfections can be used to\naugment innate epithelial immunity, this approach may be the\nbasis for development of therapeutic agents on mucosal or epider-\nmal surfaces. We appreciate that only moderate increases in resis-\ntance to bacterial invasion were noted in our experiments. Yet\nthese moderate effects may be of considerable biological impor-\ntance. For example, when keratinocytes were transfected using a\nlentivirus to overexpress cathelicidin (42), the antimicrobial ef-\nfects (\ufffd0.2 log) in vitro were more modest than what we report.\nWhen the anatomy of the squamous mucosa is considered, with\nexpressing cells stacked on expressing cells, the moderate effect\nwithin individual cells is multiplied geometrically into the antimi-\ncrobial protection of the tissue. When cathelicidin was augmented\nin mice, a profound epithelial resistance to group A streptococci\ndeveloped (42).\n\nmRNA delivery has several advantages over DNA gene transfer\ntechniques for the treatment of disease (33), despite persistent\nconcerns that the ease of synthesis and stability of transfected\nmRNA would prove insufficient to yield a useful protein product\n(23). Since mRNA does not integrate into the genome and the\ntransfection remains transient, this transfection approach avoids\nimprecise, mutagenic insertion into the host cells and offers\ngreater pharmaceutical safety (34). mRNA delivery facilitates si-\nmultaneous expression of all epitopes of an antigen, and manip-\nulation and purification are rather simple (33). mRNA transfec-\ntions have been used to express polyepitopes (43), to target\ndendritic cells ex vivo, and as anticancer vaccines in patients (44,\n45). Similarly, mRNA delivery systems are in development for T\ncell-based immunotherapy of certain tumors (46) and to increase\nerythropoiesis (47). With a view toward augmenting innate im-\nmunity, HBD-2 mRNA transfection into monocyte-derived mac-\nrophages was shown to be effective against Mycobacterium tuber-\nculosis, where the AMP and bacterium inexplicably colocalized in\nphagosomes (37). Similarly, insect-derived short proline-rich an-\ntimicrobial peptides (48) linked to a cell-penetrating peptide, pen-\netratin, entered the cytoplasm of two mammalian cell lines with-\nout marked toxicity; intracellular resistance was increased against\nMicrococcus luteus but not against Escherichia coli (48). The insect-\nderived peptides show homology to mammalian heat shock pro-\nteins, but concern about potential cross-reactivity with host pro-\nteins and an autoimmune response may limit their clinical utility.\nAugmentation of intracellular innate immunity using native, en-\ndogenous antimicrobial peptides/proteins, however, could sup-\n\nplement or supplant the use of antibiotics, avoiding the clinical\nchallenge of emergence of antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe present data show proof of principle that an mRNA deliv-\nery system could be an effective surrogate for a gene therapy ap-\nproach to augment innate mucosal epithelial immunity and for\ntreatment or control of mucosal infections. Use of this approach\nfor therapeutic purposes in mucosal infections would be en-\nhanced with an mRNA packaging system that would target epi-\nthelial cells more specifically and increase mRNA stability and\nminimize immune activation, as suggested by Weissman and col-\nleagues (35). Ultimately, the test for mRNA transfection efficiency\nis a new or augmented function and minimal associated cytotox-\nicity or induction of apoptosis. Our data show that CAMP and\ncalprotectin mRNA delivery could significantly increase resistance\nof epithelial cells to invasion by Listeria and Salmonella.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Lori A.

It faces the\nblastocoel cavity and later gives rise to the extraembryonic parietal and visceral endoderm. Here, we investigate a key step\nin primitive endoderm development, the acquisition of apico-basolateral polarity and epithelial characteristics by the non-\nepithelial inner cell mass cells. Embryoid bodies, formed from mouse embryonic stem cells, were used as a model to study\nthis transition. The outer cells of these embryoid bodies were found to gradually acquire the hallmarks of polarised\nepithelial cells and express markers of primitive endoderm cell fate. Fgf receptor/Erk signalling is known to be required for\nspecification of the primitive endoderm, but its role in polarisation of this tissue is less well understood. To investigate the\nfunction of this pathway in the primitive endoderm, embryoid bodies were cultured in the presence of a small molecule\ninhibitor of Mek. This inhibitor caused a loss of expression of markers of primitive endoderm cell fate and maintenance of\nthe pluripotency marker Nanog. In addition, a mislocalisation of apico-basolateral markers and disruption of the epithelial\nbarrier, which normally blocks free diffusion across the epithelial cell layer, occurred. Two inhibitors of the Fgf receptor\nelicited similar phenotypes, suggesting that Fgf receptor signalling promotes Erk-mediated polarisation. This data shows\nthat primitive endoderm cells of the outer layer of embryoid bodies gradually polarise, and formation of a polarised\nprimitive endoderm layer requires the Fgf receptor/Erk signalling pathway.\n\nCitation: Doughton G, Wei J, Tapon N, Welham MJ, Chalmers AD (2014) Formation of a Polarised Primitive Endoderm Layer in Embryoid Bodies Requires Fgfr/Erk\nSignalling.

The primitive\n\nendoderm forms an epithelium which localises between the\n\nblastocoel cavity and the epiblast, these three components are\n\nsurrounded by a second epithelium, the trophectoderm. Two\n\nsubpopulations are formed from the primitive endoderm, the\n\nparietal and visceral endoderm give rise to the yolk sac, whilst the\n\nvisceral endoderm also contributes to the gut endoderm and\n\nprovides embryonic patterning signals [2]. In contrast, cells of the\n\nepiblast give rise to the embryo proper. Recently, there has been a\n\nrapid increase in our understanding of how the primitive\n\nendoderm versus epiblast cell fate decision is regulated (Reviewed\n\nin [2,3]). These studies have used mouse embryos, as well as\n\nembryoid bodies which can be formed from mouse embryonic\n\nstem (mES) cells. The outer cell layer of embryoid bodies is an\n\nepithelium with many similarities to the embryonic primitive\n\nendoderm, and has therefore been used as a model of its\n\ndevelopment [4,5].\n\nCell fate decisions in the ICM cells are a dynamic process: cells\n\ninitially express both epiblast (e.g. Nanog) and primitive endoderm\n\nmarkers (e.g. Gata6 and Gata4), the expression then resolves into a\n\nsalt-and-pepper pattern within the ICM, where cells express either\n\nepiblast or primitive endoderm markers [6\u20138]. The cells of the\n\nprimitive endoderm then migrate to their final position facing the\n\nblastocoel cavity where they form an epithelial sheet.\n\nFgf receptor (Fgfr) signalling via the Raf/Mek/Erk signalling\n\n(Erk signalling) pathway has an important role in promoting\n\nprimitive endoderm formation (Reviewed in [9]). For instance\n\nGrb2, an adaptor protein that links receptor tyrosine kinases to the\n\nErk cascade, is essential for primitive endoderm development [10].\n\nInterestingly, activated H-Ras expression in Grb2-deficient mES\n\ncells promotes endoderm differentiation in embryoid bodies,\n\nsuggesting Grb2 functions through activation of Ras in this\n\ncontext [10]. A more detailed analysis of the Grb22/2 mouse\n\nphenotype demonstrated that Gata6 expression is lost and all ICM\n\ncells are Nanog positive [6]. In addition, when embryoid bodies\n\nare formed from mES cells transfected with a constitutively active\n\nMek mutant, Nanog expression is repressed, and primitive\n\nendoderm differentiation occurs [11]. This suggests that the Erk\n\nsignalling pathway mediates Nanog repression, which is known to\n\nbe required for differentiation of ICM cells into primitive\n\nendoderm. These results led to the hypothesis that the mosaic\n\nexpression of epiblast and primitive endoderm markers is\n\ndependent upon a Grb2-Ras-Mek/Erk signalling cascade.

Treatment of embryos with a\n\ncombination of inhibitors for both the Fgfr and Mek causes\n\nICM cells to express Nanog whilst repressing primitive endoderm\n\nmarkers Gata6 & 4 [16,17]. Conversely, treatment of embryos\n\nwith Fgf4 and heparin causes all cells of the ICM to become Gata6\n\npositive [17,18]. In Fgf42/2 embryos Gata6 and Nanog colocalise\n\nuntil the 32-cell stage, but by the 64-cell stage only a small number\n\nof weakly Gata6 positive cells could be detected, whilst Gata4 was\n\nnever detected. This mutant could not be rescued by addition of\n\nexogenous Fgf at a uniform concentration suggesting in vivo it is\n\nregional differences in Fgf concentration which produce the salt-\n\nand-pepper pattern [19]. Together, these studies provide convinc-\n\ning evidence that Fgf4/Fgfr activation of Erk signalling is essential\n\nfor primitive endoderm specification.\n\nIn contrast to our growing understanding of cell fate specifica-\n\ntion less is known about the mechanisms which regulate\n\npolarisation of primitive endoderm cells. A number of studies\n\nhave shown a polarised localisation of proteins within the epithelial\n\ncells of the primitive endoderm. E-cadherin is localised to their\n\nbasolateral membrane [20], and Lrp2 localises to the apical\n\nsurface of the primitive endoderm in E4.5 mouse embryos [21].\n\nThe adaptor protein Disabled-2 (Dab2) also localises apically and\n\nis required for the establishment of epithelial polarity [22,23] and\n\nLaminin, a constituent of the basement membrane is required for\n\nproper epithelial organisation of the primitive endoderm [24].\n\nIn the trophectoderm epithelial polarisation has been tightly\n\nlinked to the regulation of cell fate [25] and a role for polarity in\n\nthe control of the primitive endoderm cell fate has also been\n\nsuggested. One aspect to this is that epithelial polarity in the\n\nprimitive endoderm cells appears to anchor the sorted cells to their\n\nfinal localisation on the outer surface of the epiblast [20,22,23]. If\n\naPkc, a key regulator of cell polarity, is inhibited the primitive\n\nendoderm cells do not become anchored [26]. No effect was\n\nobserved on early primitive endoderm markers (e.g. Pdgfra), but\n\nlater there was a reduction in Gata4 positive cells. This suggests\n\nthat in addition to being essential for sorting, aPkc is also required\n\nfor maturation of the primitive endoderm cell fate [26]. Despite its\n\nwell established role in promoting primitive endoderm fate, it is\n\nnot clear if the Erk signalling pathway is required for formation of\n\na polarised primitive endoderm.\n\nHere, we use embryoid bodies as a model to investigate the\n\nmechanisms which promote polarisation of the primitive endo-\n\nderm, and determine whether the Fgfr/Erk signalling pathway is\n\nrequired for polarisation of this tissue. We show that embryoid\n\nbodies gradually expressed markers of primitive endoderm cell fate\n\nand down regulate Nanog. Polarity complex, tight junction,\n\nadherens junction, and basement membrane proteins also\n\ndeveloped a polarised localisation in the primitive endoderm\n\nlayer. Treatment with small molecule inhibitors of Mek or the Fgfr\n\ncaused the outer cells of the embryoid body to fail to upregulate\n\nprimitive endoderm markers and no longer downregulate Nanog\n\nexpression. Mislocalisation of the proteins which normally show\n\napico-basolateral polarisation in the primitive endoderm cells also\n\noccurred. Additionally, disruption of the epithelial barrier, which\n\nnormally blocks free diffusion across the epithelium of the\n\nprimitive endoderm, was observed. These results show that Fgfr\n\ndriven Erk signalling is required for the formation in embryoid\n\nbodies of a primitive endoderm layer which exhibits apico-\n\nbasolateral polarity and epithelial barrier function.\n\nMethods\n\nCulture of mESCs\nThe E14tg2A mES cell line (Clone R63) was a kind gift of Dr\n\nOwen Witte, UCLA, California, [27]. mESCs were routinely\n\ncultured on dishes coated in 0.1% (w/v) porcine gelatin (Sigma) in\n\nKnock-out Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagles Medium (Gibco) supple-\n\nmented with 15% (v/v) knockout serum replacement (Gibco),\n\n2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-\n\nRad), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Gibco) and 103 units/ml\n\nmurine Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (ESGRO; Chemicon:\n\nESG1106).

Embryoid bodies were mounted\n\nand imaged as stated in the immunofluorescence protocol.\n\nResults\n\nEmbryoid Bodies Express Primitive Endoderm Cell Fate\nMarkers by Day 7\n\nBefore studying the polarity of the primitive endoderm in\n\nembryoid bodies, the temporal development of the primitive\n\nendoderm was characterised. A hanging-drop method was used to\n\nculture the embryoid bodies, and their morphology and expression\n\nof primitive endoderm transcription factor cell fate markers was\n\nexamined. Embryoid bodies on day 3 were round and had a fairly\n\nhomogeneous morphology (Figure 1A). Over time, the embryoid\n\nbodies showed increased heterogeneity and at day 7 and 10\n\nballoon-like cysts were present (Figure 1A), which resembled those\n\nobserved previously [30].\n\nWhole-mount immunostaining of the outer-layer of the\n\nembryoid body showed that a small percentage of nuclei were\n\npositive for the primitive endoderm fate markers Gata6, Gata4 or\n\nHnf4a on day 3 (Figure 1B). As the embryoid bodies grew, the\nnumber of nuclei which expressed these markers increased,\n\nreaching a peak on day 7 (Figure 1B). Additionally, expression\n\nof the pluripotency protein Nanog decreased (Figure 1C). It was\n\nexpressed in approximately 35% of nuclei on day 3, this fell to 7%\n\non day 5 and no cells expressed Nanog by day 7. Increasing\n\nexpression of the primitive endoderm fate markers and loss of the\n\npluripotency marker Nanog suggests that the outer layer of the\n\nembryoid bodies is undergoing a developmental program similar\n\nto that observed in the embryonic primitive endoderm.\n\nPrimitive Endoderm of the Embryoid Body Develops\nApico-basolateral Polarity by Day 5\n\nThe outer layer of the embryoid bodies appears to be following\n\na developmental pathway which recapitulates primitive endoderm\n\ndevelopment. As polarity has been shown to change as the\n\nprimitive endoderm forms [26], whole-mount immunostaining\n\nwas used to observe the localisation of key markers of epithelial\n\npolarisation in embryoid bodies. After 3 days of culture, the\n\nembryoid bodies showed expression of the polarity complex\n\nprotein aPkcf/l in the outer layer of cells, where it localised to the\ncytoplasm (Figure 2A). By day 5, aPkcf/l localisation was mostly\napically restricted across the whole of the outer surface of cells of\n\nthe embryoid body, this localisation remained unchanged on day 7\n\nand 10. The tight-junction protein Zo-1 was localised to the\n\nborder between the apical and lateral side of the epithelial cells,\n\nforming rings which outlined the cells by day 3 (Figure 2B). By day\n\n5 the apical puncta were uniformly present in cells of the outer layer.\n\nb-catenin, an adherens junction protein was predominantly\npresent at the lateral side of cells of the outermost cell layer from\n\nday 3, but in some areas was also apically localised (Figure 2C). By\n\nday 5, b-catenin was consistently localised to the lateral side of the\nouter-most cell layer. Fibronectin is a basement membrane\n\nprotein, on day 3 it localised to patches directly below the\n\noutermost cell layer, and deeper into the embryoid body\n\n(Figure 2D). This localisation gradually became more specific, by\n\nday 5 the staining was more restricted to the basal side of the\n\noutermost cell layer, whilst there were still patches of apical\n\nFibronectin. By day 7 the Fibronectin was restricted to below the\n\nbasal-side of the outermost cells and no staining was observed in\n\ncells below the outer cell layer. The gradual localisation of these\n\napico-basolaterally polarised proteins shows that the epithelium\n\nsurrounding the embryoid body has begun to polarise on day 3\n\nand has clear polarisation by day 5.\n\nInhibition of Mek with PD-0325901 Results in a Loss of\nGata4 and Gata6 Expression in Embryoid Bodies\n\nErk signalling has previously been shown to have a role in\n\nprimitive endoderm fate specification [10,11], but its role in\n\npolarisation of these cells is less well established. To investigate the\n\nrole of Mek signalling in this process PD-0325901, a potent Mek\n\ninhibitor [31,32] was added to the cell suspension (day 0) and\n\nanalysis of the phenotype of the embryoid bodies was carried out\n\nafter 7 days of development (Figure 3A). Diphosphorylated Erk1\n\nand 2 was markedly decreased (Figure 3B) demonstrating that,\n\nwhen added to the media PD-0325901 successfully inhibited Mek\n\nsignalling. There was a slight reduction in size of the embryoid\n\nbodies at the highest dose tested (4 mM) in comparison to\nembryoid bodies treated with vehicle, but this was not statistically\n\nsignificant (Figure 3C). A statistically significant increase in the\n\ncircularity of the embryoid body (Figure 3D) in comparison to\n\ncontrol was observed. To establish if the addition of PD-0325901\n\ncaused an increase in apoptosis, whole-mount immunostaining for\n\ncleaved Caspase-3 was performed (Figure 3E). No significant\n\nchange in the number of nuclei positive for cleaved Caspase-3 was\n\nobserved in the outer layer of the embryoid bodies showing that\n\ninhibiting Mek did not cause a significant increase in apoptosis\n\nthat might have affected the development of these cells.\n\nDisruption of Mek-signalling causes a loss of Gata6 and Gata4\n\nexpression, and an increase in Nanog expression preventing the\n\nfate specification of the primitive endoderm both in vivo and in vitro\n\n[6,10]. The expression levels of Gata6, Gata4 and Nanog were\n\nanalysed to assess the effect Mek inhibition has in this system.\n\nWestern blotting of embryoid bodies showed a dose-dependent\n\ndecrease in Gata6 and Gata4 protein expression levels, resulting in\n\nvery little protein remaining at the highest concentration of PD-\n\n0325901 (4 uM) (Figure 4A & B). This result was confirmed using\n\nwhole-mount immunostaining of Gata6 (Figure 4C). In contrast,\n\nthe percentage of Nanog positive nuclei increased from 0% in\n\ncontrol to an average of 76% upon addition of 4 mM PD-0325901\n(Figure 4D). This confirms that upon inhibition of Mek the cells of\n\nthe outer-layer of the embryoid body failed to become primitive\n\nendoderm cells, but instead remained pluripotent.\n\nMek Inhibition Results in Disruption of Epithelial Polarity\nHaving observed a disruption in the specification of the\n\nprimitive endoderm cell fate following inhibition of Mek signalling\n\n(Figure 2), embryoid bodies were cultured in PD-0325901 and the\n\nlocalisation of polarity and junctional proteins examined (Figure 2).\n\nThe addition of 2 mM PD-0325901 appeared to cause maximal\ninhibition of ppErk1/2, but 4 mM caused a bigger reduction in\nGata4/6 staining. The expression of these proteins in the primitive\n\nendoderm is Mek dependent [33] arguing that in this system there\n\nmay be a low level of Mek signalling which is inhibited by addition\n\nof 4 mM PD-0325901. For this reason 4 mM PD-0325901 was\nchosen for subsequent experiments. aPkcf/l was apically localised\nin the control embryoid bodies, but when treated with the Mek\n\ninhibitor aPkcf/l was also present in the cytoplasm and in cell\nlayers below the outer layer (Figure 5A). After treatment with the\n\nMek inhibitor the tight-junction protein Zo-1 remained localised\n\nat the apical side of the outer layer cells but did not form a belt-like\n\nstructure around the cells (Figure 5B). Occasional labelled\n\njunctions remained, but the majority of protein was present in\n\nisolated puncta. This suggested that inhibition of Mek disrupted the\n\nformation of the tight junctions and the localisation of aPkcf/l.\n\nFgfr/Erk and Primitive Endoderm Polarisation\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95434\n\n\n\nb-catenin localisation was also disrupted by treatment with the\nMek inhibitor. It localised apically as well as laterally in the outer\n\ncell layer of embryoid bodies treated with PD-0325901 (Figure 5C)\n\nand was observed in the second layer of cells (the layer below the\n\nouter-layer). This localisation was not observed in the controls\n\n(Figure 5C, 2nd layer panel). Lastly, a disruption in the localisation\n\nFigure 6.

Upon addition of PD-0325901, Fibronectin formed\n\nsmall aggregates of protein instead of a fibrous network as\n\nobserved in the control embryoid bodies. In addition, the\n\nFibronectin protein in embryoid bodies treated with PD-\n\n0325901 was not basally restricted, but was present in all cell\n\nlayers observed. The mislocalisation of aPkcf/l, as well as tight\njunction, adherens junction and basement membrane proteins\n\nshows that the apico-basolateral polarity of the outer layer of\n\nembryoid bodies was disrupted following Mek inhibition.\n\nLoss of Gata6 and Gata4 Expression upon Inhibition of\nFgfr Signalling\n\nAs disruption of the Erk signalling cascade resulted in a\n\ndisruption in the apico-basolateral polarity of the outer-layer of the\n\nembryoid body, we wished to identify the receptor responsible for\n\nErk activation in this system. A leading candidate for this was the\n\nFgfr, as its inhibition has previously been shown to decrease\n\nexpression of Gata6 and Gata4, disrupting further fate specifica-\n\ntion of the primitive endoderm [13\u201315]. A newly developed potent\n\nand selective inhibitor of the Fgfr, AZD-4547, was used to treat\n\nembryoid bodies (Figure 6A). This inhibitor was chosen as it is\n\nmore selective than previously available compounds such as PD-\n\n173074 [34,35]. Addition of this inhibitor caused a reduction in\n\nppERK1 and 2 (Figure 6B). Some ppErk expression remained,\n\nperhaps due to other signalling pathways upstream of Mek such as\n\nGPCRs, integrins or other receptor tyrosine kinases. Addition of\n\nAZD-4547 produced embryoid bodies which were smaller than\n\ncontrols even at the lowest dose tested (1uM) (Figure 6A&C).\n\nThere was also a dose dependent increase in the circularity of the\n\nembryoid bodies, resulting in embryoid bodies which were\n\nsignificantly more circular than controls when cultured with\n\n4 mM and 8 mM PD-0325901 (Figure 6A&D). To determine if\naddition of AZD-4547 caused an effect on apoptosis whole-mount\n\nimmunostaining for cleaved Caspase-3 was carried out. There was\n\na small, but not statistically significant, increase in the number of\n\nnuclei in the outer-layer of the embryoid body which were positive\n\nfor cleaved Caspase-3 (Figure 6E). The majority of cells (.85%)\n\nremained Caspase negative, arguing that any changes in\n\ndevelopment of the primitive endoderm are not due to cell death.\n\nA dose-dependent decrease in expression levels of both Gata4\n\nand Gata6 was observed by western blotting when embryoid\n\nbodies were grown in increasing concentrations of the Fgfr\n\ninhibitor (Figure 7A&B). Additionally, whole-mount immuno-\n\nstaining confirmed a reduction in Gata6 positive nuclei when\n\n4 mM AZD-4547 was used (Figure 7C). Nanog expression\nincreased from 0% in control to an average of 82% upon\n\ninhibition of the Fgfr (Figure 7D). This suggests that Fgfr signalling\n\nis activating Erk to drive an increase in size, heterogeneity of\n\nshape, loss of Nanog, and expression of primitive endoderm fate\n\nmarkers in embryoid bodies.\n\nLoss of Apico-basolateral Polarity upon Fgfr Inhibition\nHaving observed a loss in expression of primitive endoderm\n\nmarkers, we examined apico-basolateral polarity components\n\nfollowing inhibition of the Fgfr. This analysis was performed\n\nusing 4 mM AZD-4547 as a clear inhibition of ppERK, loss of\nGata6 and Gata4 expression and, morphological changes were\n\nobserved at this concentration. Following inhibition of the Fgfr,\n\naPkcf/l localised throughout the cytoplasm of the outer-layer and\nwas found in the layers below (Figure 8A). A disruption in both\n\nadherens junctions and tight junction proteins was also observed.\n\nZo-1 localised to apical puncta, but did not form a belt around the\n\nperiphery of the cells, instead only patches or short lines of Zo-1\n\nwere detected (Figure 8B). b-catenin was observed apically in some\ncells and was also found in the cells below the outer layer\n\n(Figure 8C). Localisation of Fibronectin was also investigated. The\n\nprotein was spread throughout the outer layer, as well as in layers\n\nFigure 7.

Quan-\n\ntification suggested some small changes following inhibitor\n\ntreatment, but none of these were statistically significant. This\n\nargues that, although small changes cannot be ruled out, inhibition\n\nof Mek or the Fgfr predominantly caused a re-localisation of these\n\nproteins rather than a change in their expression levels.\n\nInhibition of the Fgfr with PD-173074 Causes a\nDisruption in Polarisation of the Outer-layer of Cells\n\nTreatment of embryoid bodies with the recently developed Fgfr\n\ninhibitor AZD-4547 caused a mis-localisation of apico-basolater-\n\nally polarised proteins. To confirm the specificity of this effect and\n\nallow comparison with previous literature, the polarisation of\n\nembryoid bodies was observed using the structurally distinct and\n\nmore commonly used inhibitor PD-173074. This is an effective\n\ninhibitor of Fgfr1, but also inhibits the Vascular endothelial\n\ngrowth factor receptor 2 (Vegfr2) [35]. The polarisation of the\n\nprimitive endoderm was observed following treatment with\n\n0.1 mM PD-173074 which is the concentration commonly used\nfor studying primitive endoderm in vivo [16,17]. In these in vivo\n\nstudies it is often used in combination with a Mek inhibitor\n\n[16,17]. Embryoid bodies were therefore also treated with 0.1 mM\nPD-173074 and 1 mM PD-0325901, the combination and\nconcentration of inhibitors previously used to assess primitive\n\nendoderm development [16,17].\n\nThe tight-junction protein Zo-1 localised to junctions in control\n\nembryoid bodies, but this localisation was disrupted following\n\ntreatment with either 0.1 mM PD-173074 or the combination of\n0.1 mM PD-173074 and 1 mM PD-0325901 (Figure 10A). The\nlocalisation of the adherens junction protein b-catenin was also\ndisrupted following treatment with PD-173074 and when treated\n\nwith the combined inhibitors (Figure 10B). The use of two\n\nstructurally distinct inhibitors of the Fgfr, which gave very similar\n\nresults, argues that the phenotypes described above are caused by\n\nspecifically inhibiting Fgfr signalling.\n\nInhibition of Mek or the Fgfr Signalling Results in a Loss\nof Epithelial Barrier Function\n\nThe maintenance of a diffusion barrier is a common function of\n\nepithelial layers [36]. We therefore investigated if, in addition to\n\nthe mislocalisation of apico-basolateral polarity proteins described\n\nabove, the cells of the embryoid bodies had defects in their barrier\n\nFigure 9.

Our data demonstrates\n\na gradual increase in expression of primitive endoderm markers,\n\nloss of Nanog expression and establishment of epithelial polarisa-\n\ntion in the primitive endoderm layer of embryoid bodies.\n\nInhibition of both Mek and the Fgfr caused a loss of primitive\n\nendoderm markers, maintenance of Nanog and mislocalisation of\n\nall the polarity proteins examined; polarity complex protein\n\naPkcf/l, tight junction protein Zo-1, adherens junction protein b-\ncatenin, and basement membrane protein Fibronectin. Associated\n\nwith the disruption in polarity and junctional protein localisation\n\nwas a loss of the barrier function of the epithelium. This argues\n\nthat Fgfr signalling activates Erk 1 and 2 which then promotes cell\n\nfate specification, polarisation and establishment of a functional\n\nepithelial barrier.\n\nEmbryoid Bodies as a Model of Epithelial Polarity\nThe polarised localisation of a number of proteins has been\n\npreviously reported in the primitive endoderm [20\u201324], however,\n\nthe temporal localisation of multiple epithelial polarity proteins has\n\nnot previously been examined. The results presented here show\n\nthat the primitive endoderm of an embryoid body gradually\n\npolarises in an order which is similar to that observed in other\n\nepithelia (Reviewed by [37]). Zo-1 and b-catenin localise at\njunctions at the initial stage of cell polarisation, followed by\n\nlocalisation of aPkcf/l at the apical membrane and deposition of\nFibronectin to form a basement membrane.\n\nThere are many different models which can be used to study\n\nepithelial polarisation, including model organisms such as\n\nDrosophila melanogaster, polarised cell culture cells such as MDCK\n\ncells, and epithelial organs from embryonic and adult mice [38\u2013\n\n40]. However, the primitive endoderm of an embryoid body has a\n\nnumber of characteristics which we believe will make it a valuable\n\nmodel for future experiments. It is a 3 dimensional model\n\ncomposed of a variety of non-transformed cell types, which\n\ngradually polarise and express cell fate markers. There are also a\n\ngrowing number of knockout and transgenic ES cell lines which\n\ncould be studied in this system [41,42]. In particular, embryoid\n\nbodies are well suited for studying the relationship between\n\npolarisation and fate specification in a developing epithelium.\n\nFgfr/Erk Signalling is Required for Cell Fate Specification\nand Polarisation of the Primitive Endoderm\n\nThe Fgfr/Erk signalling pathway is known to be required for\n\ncell fate specification of the primitive endoderm [9]. Our data\n\nconfirms that inhibition of either the Fgfr or Mek signalling causes\n\na loss of primitive endoderm cell fate markers and maintenance of\n\nFigure 11. Inhibition of the Fgfr or Mek caused a loss in barrier function of the cells in the outer layer of the embryoid body.\nEmbryoid bodies were treated with (A) 0.04% DMSO, or 4 mM PD-0325901(Mek inhibitor), (B) 0.04% DMSO or 4 mM AZD-4547 (Fgfr inhibitor) for 7\ndays. A membrane impermeable biotin which covalently links to amino groups was added to the embryoid bodies and subsequently visualised using\nAlexa-fluor-488-conjugated Streptavidin. The biotin was largely restricted to the apical surface of the embryoid body in DMSO controls. Following\ntreatment with either a Mek or an Fgfr inhibitor, biotin also bound to basolateral membrane proteins of the outer cell layer and the membranes of\ncells under this layer. This shows that the normal epithelial barrier has been disrupted. A representative image from 3 independent experiments is\nshown. Scale bars 10 mm. Dotted lines represent position that the relevant orthogonal or aerial images were taken.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095434.g011\n\nFgfr/Erk and Primitive Endoderm Polarisation\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95434\n\n\n\nthe pluripotency protein Nanog. Interestingly, inhibition of the\n\nFgfr caused a stronger reduction of primitive endoderm fate\n\nmarkers, despite inducing less inhibition of Erk than the Mek\n\ninhibitor. This suggests that another receptor may be activating\n\nMek. It also raises the possibility that the Fgfr might be activating\n\nother signalling pathways, such as Pi3k-Akt, Stat, Plcc, p38\nMapK, and Jnk [43] to promote expression of Gata4 and Gata6.\n\nThese additional pathways may regulate embryoid body size, as\n\nthe Fgfr inhibitor caused a bigger reduction in size than addition of\n\nthe Mek inhibitor. Another interesting phenotype seen following\n\ninhibition of both Fgfr or Mek was an increase in circularity. This\n\nmay be caused by a failure to become cystic, causing the embryoid\n\nbodies to remain more homogeneous. Gata42/2 embryoid bodies\n\nare also smaller than controls and non-cystic [44] and embryoid\n\nbodies made with Laminin c12/2 mES cells do not cavitate [45].\nTherefore, the increase in circularity may be linked to a failure in\n\nprimitive endoderm development and polarisation.\n\nOur data also show that Fgfr/Erk signalling is required for the\n\nformation of a polarised primitive endoderm layer with an efficient\n\nbarrier function. This hypothesis is supported by a several other\n\nfindings. Firstly, aPkc does not polarise in the primitive endoderm\n\nof embryos grown in 2i medium, which includes a Mek and a\n\nGSK3b inhibitor [26]. Secondly, expression of a truncated form of\nFgfr2 in mES cells has been reported to disrupt basement\n\nmembrane formation [46], while Grb2 knockout embryoid bodies\n\nshow an absence of Laminin basal to the outer cell layer [10].\n\nCombining our data with previous studies leads us to propose that\n\nthe Fgfr/MAPK signalling pathway promotes polarisation of the\n\nprimitive endoderm as well as its fate. There are at least three\n\npossibilities to explain this dual role; 1) Fgfr/Erk signalling\n\nregulates primitive endoderm cell fate specification which then\n\npromotes polarisation. 2) Fgfr/Erk signalling initiates the polar-\n\nisation of the primitive endoderm which then drives fate\n\nspecification. 3) MAPK independently regulates both the polar-\n\nisation and fate determination of the primitive endoderm.\n\nIn embryoid bodies, the cells start to polarise prior to the\n\nmaximal nuclear localisation of Gata6, Gata4, and Hnf4a\n(Figures 1 and 2). This suggests that in embryoid bodies the onset\n\nof polarisation occurs before cell fate specification and argues\n\nagainst model one where cell fate regulators promote polarisation.\n\nThere is also evidence that disrupting polarisation of the primitive\n\nendoderm does not affect fate determination, arguing against\n\nmodel two. Embryoid bodies formed with mES cells which do not\n\nexpress Laminin c1, a key component of the basement membrane,\nhave primitive endoderm cells in the outer-layer although they\n\nwere not properly organised [24,45]. Additionally, E-cadherin 2/2\n\nES cells showed normal primitive endoderm development, but the\n\nembryoid bodies did not form a cavity, consistent with defects in\n\nepithelial barrier formation [23]. In Dab2 null mouse embryos\n\ncells of the primitive endoderm lose their apico-basolateral\n\npolarity. In these embryos Gata4 expression was observed, but\n\npositive cells were positioned throughout the epiblast, suggesting a\n\nfailure in positioning but not fate regulation [22,23].\n\nThe studies described above argue against the idea of polarity\n\nregulating cell fate (model 2). However, there is also conflicting\n\nevidence that loss of proteins required for epithelial polarisation\n\ncan disrupt primitive endoderm fate specification. In Integrin\n\nb12/2 embryoid bodies, a-fetoprotein (a marker of visceral\nendoderm) is only expressed in clusters of endoderm cells, Dab2\n\nprotein was not observed by immunostaining, and Gata4 became\n\ncytoplasmic [47]. This suggests that the absence of integrins\n\ndisrupts the development of the primitive endoderm. The mutant\n\nembryoid bodies had no diphospho-Erk1/2, and had reduced p38\n\nand Akt activation suggesting that Integrins control endoderm\n\ndifferentiation via the Raf/Erk and Akt signalling pathways [47].\n\nLive-imaging of embryos treated with an aPkc inhibitor revealed\n\nthat the primitive endoderm cells migrate but fail to remain on the\n\nICM surface when they reach the cavity. This resulted in primitive\n\nendoderm cells being present throughout the epiblast rather than\n\nforming a distinct layer on the edge of the blastocoel [26]. No\n\neffect was seen on early markers of the primitive endoderm fate\n\n(Pdgfra, and Gata6), but some cells were negative for both Nanog\n\nand Gata4, suggesting a defect in primitive endoderm maturation\n\n[26]. Co-transfection experiments also showed that the Dab2\n\npromoter can be transactivated by forced expression of Gata6, in\n\nNIH-3T3 cells [48] suggesting the polarity regulator Dab2 may be\n\na downstream target of the cell fate regulator Gata6. In summary,\n\ncurrent evidence appears to support the idea of a hybrid model\n\nwhere early regulation of primitive endoderm fate acts upstream of\n\npolarisation, but that aPkc and possibly other regulators of\n\npolarity, are required for the maturation of the primitive\n\nendoderm fate. This is clearly a complex process, and the\n\nmechanistic elucidation of Fgfr/Erk signalling\u2019s dual role in cell\n\nfate determination and cell polarisation, and how these two\n\nprocesses are interlinked and interact will be a key aim goal for\n\nfuture work.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that the Fgfr/Erk\n\npathway is required for the formation of a polarised primitive\n\nendoderm cell layer in embryoid bodies. Further studies into the\n\nmechanisms responsible for this requirement and the relationship\n\nbetween cell fate specification and cell polarity are needed to\n\nimprove our understanding of the development of this key\n\nembryonic cell type. These studies are likely to be relevant to\n\nthe development of other embryonic and adult epithelia.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Benjamin Sharpe, Christopher Bryant and\n\nSilvia Munoz-Descalzo for reading a draft of this manuscript.

Carlson1, Michael Hsu1 & Irina M. Conboy1\n\nAdult skeletal muscle robustly regenerates throughout an orga-\nnism\u2019s life, but as the muscle ages, its ability to repair diminishes\nand eventually fails1,2. Previous work suggests that the regenera-\ntive potential ofmuscle stem cells (satellite cells) is not triggered in\nthe old muscle because of a decline in Notch activation, and that it\ncan be rejuvenated by forced local activation of Notch3. Here we\nreport that, in addition to the loss of Notch activation, old muscle\nproduces excessive transforming growth factor (TGF)-b (but not\nmyostatin), which induces unusually high levels of TGF-b pSmad3\nin resident satellite cells and interferes with their regenerative\ncapacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and pSmad3 antagonize\neach other in the control of satellite-cell proliferation, such that\nactivation of Notch blocks the TGF-b-dependent upregulation of\nthe cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16, p21 and\np27, whereas inhibition of Notch induces them. Furthermore, in\nmuscle stem cells, Notch activity determines the binding of\npSmad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell-cycle\nprogression. Attenuation of TGF-b/pSmad3 in old, injuredmuscle\nrestores regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus a balance\nbetween endogenous pSmad3 and active Notch controls the regen-\nerative competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this\nbalance in the oldmusclemicroniche interferes with regeneration.\n\nSatellite cells are muscle stem cells capable of lifelong maintenance\nand repair of myofibres, or differentiated muscle cells4\u20136. The decline\nin muscle tissue regeneration with age is largely due to a decreased\nactivation of Notch pathway, which is required for satellite cells to\nbreak quiescence and prevents premature differentiation into myo-\ntubes by antagonizingWnt pathway3\u20139. Forced activation of Notch-1,\nby antibody specific to its external domain (Notch-1 cleavage and\nactivation), rejuvenates muscle repair; whereas inhibiting Notch in\nyoung muscle interferes with regeneration3, suggesting that Notch\npathway is an essential and age-specific molecular determinant of\nadult myogenesis.\n\nIt is widely believed that the microenvironment controls resident\nstem-cell behaviour10, and our recent work established that aged\nmuscle fibres inhibit the regenerative responses of muscle stem\ncells11. Here we examine the biochemical changes occurring in the\naged microniche of muscle stem cells, for example differentiated\nmyofibres, focusing on the age-specific interplay between active\nNotch and TGF-b/pSmad3 and on the ability of this signal integ-\nration to control levels of CDK inhibitors in satellite cells.\n\nBinding of activated TGF-b proteins to their receptors induces the\nphosphorylation and activation of the Smad transcription factors,\nwhich formheteromers (Smad4 as a common component) that trans-\nlocate into the nucleus12\u201315. Different ligands, for example TGF-b1,\n-b2, -b3 and myostatin, are capable of activating the same Smad2, 3\nproteins12,16,17. Increased TGF-b signalling has been implicated in the\ninhibition of cell-cycle progression (both generally and in myogenic\nlineage), by activating CDK inhibitors and inactivating cMyc14,18\u201322.\n\nImportantly, recent genetic-targeting experiments suggest that during\nageing the necessity to impose cell-cycle checkpoints becomes\nantagonistic to the regenerative responses of adult stem cells23\u201326.\n\nThis report establishes the following causalities: (1) old myofibres\ninhibit their own repair by shifting balance from active Notch to\nover-pronounced pSmad3 in resident muscle stem cells, which upre-\ngulates p15, p16, p21 and p27 and thwarts satellite-cell regenerative\ncapacity; (2) active Notch can override this block of satellite-cell\nresponses by removal of pSmad3 from CDK inhibitor promoters.\n\nGrowth factors, including TGF-b family members, are typically\nlocalized and activated in a tissue\u2019s extracellular matrix (ECM),\nwhich in skeletal muscle is the main component of the basement\nmembrane surrounding myofibres and their associated satellite\ncells27.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, there is dramatic and constant upregulation of\nfunctional TGF-b, but not the muscle-specific family member myos-\ntatin28, in the aged, injured and restingmuscle compared with young.\nAs expected, when present at high levels, TGF-b co-localizes with the\nlaminin1 basementmembrane (the immediatemicroniche ofmuscle\nstem cells) (Fig. 1a)29. Isotype-matched antibody controls for these\nand other experiments were negative (Supplementary Fig. 1a). These\ndata were confirmed in western blot analysis, which also established\nthat with age both differentiated myofibres and satellite cells, located\nin resting and injured muscle, upregulate levels of TGF-b (inactive\nprecursor plus bioactive protein) and pSmad3 (Fig. 1b\u2013e and\nSupplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, levels of myostatin and follistatin\nare not changed with age (Fig. 1a\u2013c). In agreement with previously\npublished work3, the levels of active Notch were reciprocal to those of\npSmad3 and TGF-b, which is high in young and low in old satellite\ncells (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). The purity of satellite cells\nin these preparations is greater than 95% (Supplementary Fig. 3)3.\nHigh levels of nuclear pSmad3 were also detected in satellite cells\nresiding in the aged muscle in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 4), and\nexcessive TGF-b was detected in old muscle at days 1 and 3 after\ninjury (not shown).\n\nOur recent report demonstrated that proliferation andmyogenesis\nof even young satellite cells are inhibited by the aged myofibres11.\nInterestingly, factors secreted by aged myofibres rapidly upregulated\nTGF-b production by young satellite cells (Fig. 1f) in transwell co-\ncultures (impermeable to cell migration). This provides a molecular\nexplanation for the pre-mature \u2018ageing\u2019 of young progenitor cells\nexposed to aged tissue.\n\nThese data establish that although both Notch and pSmad3 can be\nrobustly activated in skeletal muscle, because their ligands are\nexpressed by myofibres and satellite cells, with age the balance is\nshifted from active Notch to active TGF-b/pSmad3 (Fig. 1)3.\n\nDuring the first days after injury, satellite cells need to break qui-\nescence and proliferate. However, there is an age-specific elevation of\npSmad3 and diminished Notch activation, either one of which is\n\n1Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.\n\nVol 454 |24 July 2008 |doi:10.1038/nature07034\n\n528\n\n \u00a92008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We hypothesized that\nexcessive levels of TGF-b/pSmad might upregulate the levels of CDK\ninhibitors in muscle stem cells, whereas activation of Notch might\nantagonize this process. After muscle injury, satellite cells were\nderived from young muscle3 and cultured with TGF-b1, with or\nwithout simultaneous forced activation of Notch. Compared with\nuntreated cells, exogenously added TGF-b1 caused a prompt upre-\ngulation of p15, p16, p21 and p27 in satellite cells (Fig. 2a, quantified\nin Fig. 2b). When endogenous Notch was experimentally activated,\nsimultaneously with TGF-b1 treatment, the inducing effects on p15,\np16, p21 and p27 levels were significantly attenuated (Fig. 2a, b and\nSupplementary Fig. 5c) at a range of TGF-b1 concentrations\n(Supplementary Fig. 5). Manipulation of TGF-b/pSmad and active\nNotch balance not only controls CDK inhibitor levels, but also reg-\nulates proliferation of satellite cells in their endogenous microniches\n(Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\nTo analyse this antagonistic interaction with higher precision, we\nexamined whether active Notch and pSmad3 physically interact on\npromoters of the p15, p16, p21 and p27 genes. A pSmad3-specific\nchromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) was performed on\nsatellite cells treated with TGF-b only, activation of Notch only,\nTGF-b and activation of Notch together or untreated.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2c, both active Notch and RNA polymerase II are\ndetected in a complex with pSmad3, suggesting that active Notch and\npSmad3 physically interact on gene regulatory regions. Consistent\nwith the idea of functional balance, forced activation of Notch\nyielded more endogenous Notch and treatment with TGF-b yielded\nmore pSmad3 in these complexes (Fig. 2c).\n\nDNA co-precipitated with pSmad3 was analysed by quantitative\npolymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), using primers specific for 59\npromoter regulatory regions of p15, p16, p21 and p27 (Fig. 2d, e).\nThese data provided a further understanding of the molecular mech-\nanism of active Notch and TGF-b/pSmad3 antagonism. Namely,\nforced activation of Notch dramatically reduced pSmad3 presence\non the promoter regions of p15, p16, p21 and p27, even in the pres-\nence of TGF-b treatment (Fig. 2d, e).\n\nInterestingly, in the absence ofNotch activation (byc-secretase inhib-\nitor (GSI)), young/low levels of TGF-b are sufficient to induce p15, p16,\np21 and p27 proteins (Fig. 3a, b); and pSmad3 presence on the promo-\nters of these genes increases in young muscle stem cells (Fig. 3d, e).\nExpectedly, less activeNotchwas detected inNotch\u2013pSmad3 complexes\nafter treatment with GSI, whereas pSmad3 levels were not affected\n(Fig. 3c). These results were confirmed with several sets of PCR primers\nspanning about 1 kilobase of the studied regulatory regions; and corro-\nborated by negative controls, including the lack of amplification of a\nSmad3 non-enriched genome region (Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\nThese data show that in muscle stem cells, active Notch attenuates\nage-specific induction of multiple CDK inhibitors by reducing the\npresence of pSmad3 on their promoter regions; and that either\ndiminished Notch activation or increased TGF-b/pSmad3 levels are\nsufficient for upregulating these negative regulators of cell-cycle pro-\ngression (Figs 2 and 3, and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).\nInterestingly, p16 is sensitive to a slight increase in pSmad3, as inhibi-\ntion of Notch robustly enhanced pSmad3 binding, whereas Notch\nactivation did not significantly reduce TGF-b imposed pSmad3 bind-\ning to the p16 promoter (Figs 2, 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\nResting Injured/regenerating\n\nLaminin/Hoechst\n\nA\nnt\n\ni-\nTG\n\nF-\n\u03b2\n\nA\nnt\n\ni-\nm\n\nyo\nst\n\nat\nin\n\nA\nnt\n\ni-\nfo\n\nlli\nst\n\nat\nin\n\nYoung\n\nOld\n\nOld\n\nYoung\n\nYoung\n\nOld\n\na\n\nS\nat\n\nel\nlit\n\ne \nce\n\nlls\n\nAnti-TGF-\u03b2\n\nAnti-actin\n\nAnti-Notch\n\nAnti-myostatin\n\nAnti-follistatin\n\nUninjured\n\n Young          Old          Young        Old\n\nM\nyo\n\nfib\nre\n\ns\n\nInjured/regenerating\n\nAnti-TGF-\u03b2\n\nAnti-actin\n\nAnti-myostatin\n\nAnti-follistatin\n\nb\n\nUninjured\n\nYoung Old Young Old Young Old\n\n1 day post-injury 3 days post-injury\n\nAnti-Smad3\n\nAnti-pSmad3\n\nAnti-pSmad3\n\nAnti-Smad3\n\nS\nat\n\nel\nlit\n\ne\nce\n\nlls\nM\n\nyo\nfib\n\nre\ns\n\nIm\nm\n\nun\nop\n\nre\nci\n\np\nita\n\ntio\nn:\n\n a\nnt\n\ni-\nS\n\nm\nad\n\n3\n\nd\n\nAnti-TGF-\u03b2\n\nAnti-actin\n\nYsc +\nYmf\n\nYsc +\nOmf \n\nf\n\nTG\nF-\n\n\u03b2 \nup\n\nre\ngu\n\nla\ntio\n\nn \nin\n\n o\nld\n\n m\nyo\n\nfib\nre\n\ns/\nsa\n\nte\nlli\n\nte\n c\n\nel\nls\n\n n\nor\n\nm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n t\no \n\nyo\nun\n\ng\n(Y\n\nou\nng\n\n =\n 0\n\n) (\n%\n\n)\n\nUninjured Injured/regenerating\nM\n\nyo\nsta\n\ntin\n\nFo\nllis\n\nta\ntin\n\nTG\nF-\n\n\u03b2\n\nM\nyo\n\nsta\ntin\n\nFo\nllis\n\nta\ntin\n\nTG\nF-\n\n\u03b2\n\n*\n\n*\nAge-specific induction of TGF-\u03b2\n\nMyofibres\nSatellite cells\n\nc\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n\nSatellite cells Myofibres\n\n1 \nda\n\ny p\nos\n\nt-i\nnju\n\nry\n\n3 \nda\n\nys\n p\n\nos\nt-i\n\nnju\nry\n\nUn\ninj\n\nur\ned\n\n1 \nda\n\ny p\nos\n\nt-i\nnju\n\nry\n\n3 \nda\n\nys\n p\n\nos\nt-i\n\nnju\nry\n\nUn\ninj\n\nur\ned\n\np\nS\n\nm\nad\n\n3 \nup\n\nre\ngu\n\nla\ntio\n\nn \nin\n\n o\nld\n\nno\nrm\n\nal\niz\n\ned\n t\n\no \nyo\n\nun\ng \n\n(Y\nou\n\nng\n =\n\n 0\n) (\n\n%\n) \n\n*\n\n*\n\nAge-specific induction of pSmad3\n\ne\n\n\u201320\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFigure 1 | TGF-b/pSmad3, but not myostatin, increases in old skeletal\nmuscle. a, Immunodetection of TGF-b, myostatin or follistatin (green) and\nlaminin (red) in 10-mm skeletal muscle cryosections.

All rights reserved\n\n\n\nTo confirm these findings and address their physiological signifi-\ncance in vivo, we examined whether aged muscle stem cells would\neffectively repair old tissue when pSmad3 is locally attenuated by\nlentivirally delivered short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to Smad3.\n\nYoung and old muscles were infected with the following lentiviral\nparticles in vivo: three different Smad3-targeted shRNAs, non-target\nshRNA to control for non-specific RNA interference or transduction\ncontrol; and followed by muscle injury (Fig. 4 and Supplementary\nFigs 8\u201310). As expected, at 5 days after injury, old control muscle\ncontains fewer regenerated myofibres than young, based on haema-\ntoxylin and eosin histology and immunodetection of eMyHC de novo\nmyofibres with centrally located bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU1) nuclei\nthat are the fusion product of myoblasts generated by satellite cells\n(Fig. 4)3. In contrast to control viral transduction and non-target\nshRNA control, the acute in vivo expression of each one of the\nSmad3-targeted shRNAs enhanced and rejuvenated regeneration of\nold muscle (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 10a). Furthermore, in\nold muscle satellite cells there was pronounced increase in p15 (at all\ntimes) and p21 (upon muscle injury); and importantly, p15 and p21\nwere attenuated in vivo to their \u2018youthful\u2019 levels by each tested\nSmad3-targeted shRNA, but not by non-target shRNA (Fig. 4c, d).\nThe levels of p16 and of p21, p27 were not increased in quiescent\nsatellite cells endogenous to old resting muscle, consistent with rapid\nactivation of their myogenic responses in young environments\n(Fig. 4c, d)3,11. A slight increase in p16 and p27 levels was detected\n24 h after injury, suggesting a potential physiological importance for\nearly muscle stem-cell responses (Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus, ele-\nvated TGF-b/pSmad3 assures the age-dependent upregulation of at\nleast one CDK inhibitor at all times, while specific time points are\nexpectedly different for individual CDK inhibitors known to be\nunder control of many molecular cues. These data strongly suggest\nthat Smad3-specific (rather than non-target effects30) rescued the\nsatellite-cell regenerative responses in old niches, as three different\nSmad3-targeted shRNAs similarly enhanced myogenesis of old\n\nmuscle and diminished the levels of p15 and p21, but not of p16\nand p27 in the aged satellite cells (Fig. 4a\u2013d and Supplementary\nFig. 10). Smad3 targeting of these shRNAs is confirmed by the\nexpected downregulation of messenger RNA levels of Smad3 and\nnuclear levels of pSmad3 protein, as well as of Smad3, Smad6,\nSmad7, TGF-b and myostatin in satellite cells in vivo14,15\n\n(Supplementary Fig. 10b\u2013e). Notably, pan-neutralizing antibody\nagainst TGF-b rejuvenated repair of old muscle, and recombinant\nTGF-b resulted in scarring of youngmuscle (Supplementary Fig. 11),\nboth of which are consistent with the effects of Smad3 targeting by\nthree different shRNAs.\n\nIn contrast, inhibition of myostatin by follistatin resulted in multi-\ntudes of very small nascentmyofibres, and proliferatingMyf-51myo-\ngenic cells that persisted within the injured area (Supplementary Fig.\n11). Such a defect in myogenic differentiation was also evident when\nboth TGF-b and myostatin were neutralized; strongly suggesting that\nmyostatin, which remains constant with age (Fig. 1), is required for\nproductive differentiation of myogenic cells into myofibres. Distinct\nregenerative outcomes, where neutralization of TGF-b but not myo-\nstatin restores productive repair to oldmuscle, confirms that TGF-b is\nthe main age-specific local inhibitor in skeletal muscle niche.\n\nComprehensively, this work establishes that productive muscle\nrepair is determined by an antagonistic balance between the levels\nof TGF-b/pSmad3 (low in young and high in old) and the activation\nofNotch (high in young and low in old)3, which regulates the levels of\nfour distinct CDK inhibitors in resident stem cells. An age-specific\nshift in either pathway would suffice for the upregulation of CDK\ninhibitors and diminished proliferation of muscle stem cells.\nDeregulation of both Notch and TGF-b/pSmad3 thus assures the\nlack of satellite-cell activation in the context of aged microniche.\n\nOur data indicate that TGF-b does not directly inhibit the expres-\nsion of Notch ligand Delta, or the levels of active Notch in satellite\ncells (Supplementary Fig. 12). Likewise, activation of Notch does not\ndirectly diminish the TGF-b/pSmad3 levels (Figs 2 and 3).

Skeletalmusclewas cardiotoxin\n\ninjured3. Co-injection with anti-TGF-b neutralizing antibody, TGF-b, follistatin\nor IgG was performed in some experiments. Muscle was isolated 1\u20135 days after\n\ninjury and prepared for cryosectioning/histology, western blotting or in vitro cul-\n\nturing of myofibre explants and satellite cells.\n\nImmunocytochemistry/histological analyses were performed as described3,11.\n\nSamples were analysed with a Zeiss Axio Imager A1, imaged with an Axiocam\n\nMRc camera and AxioVision software. Western blots were analysed with Bio-\n\nRad Gel Doc/Chemi Doc Imaging System and Quantity One software.\n\nTranswell co-cultures (1mm) were performed with isolated satellite cells and\nyoung/old myofibres. Conditioned supernatants were analysed for secreted\n\nbioactive TGF-b1 levels in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based\ncytokine antibody arrays (Raybiotech). CDK inhibitors were induced in vitro by\n\nculturing isolated satellite cells with TGF-b1 or myostatin. Notch was activated\nby immobilized Delta or EDTA exposure before seeding.\n\nLentiviral transduction was performed with distinct Smad3 shRNAs: acces-\n\nsion number NM_016769.2.

Smad3 shRNA cocktail (shRNA-1, see Methods) yielded results sim-\n\nilar to shRNAs 2, 3. Control transduction with non-target shRNA or GFP\n\ntransduction lentiviral particles was also performed.\n\nBrdU was injected intraperitoneally, 3 days after injury. Tissues were analysed\n\n5 days after injury for regenerative responses and transduction levels by histo-\n\nlogical analysis, western blotting and PCR with reverse transcription (RT\u2013PCR)\n\n(Bio-Rad iQ5).\n\nIn ChIP assays (Upstate), satellite cells underwent treatments for 24 h, fol-\n\nlowed by DNA shearing and immunoprecipitations. Proteins co-precipitated\n\nwith pSmad3 were analysed by western blot. pSmad3 co-precipitated DNA\n\nwas analysed using primers to the gene regulatory regions of p15, p16, p21\n\nand p27. Real-time qPCR samples were analysed using a Bio-Rad iQ5 real-time\n\nPCR detection system, with iQ5 optical system software.

Young (2\u20133 month) and old (22\u201324 month) C57 BL/6 male\nmice were obtained from pathogen-free breeding colonies at Jackson\n\nLaboratories and the National Institute on Ageing, respectively. Animals were\n\nhoused at the Northwest Animal Facility, University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAnimal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Administrative\n\nPanel on Laboratory Animal Care at University of California, Berkeley.\n\nMuscle injury. Tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles of mice were\ninjected with 5 ng cardiotoxin (CTX-1) (Sigma), suspended in 13PBS at four\n\nor five sites in each muscle (10 ml per site), using a 28-gauge needle. In some\nexperiments anti-TGF-b neutralizing antibody, TGF-b or control goat IgG (all at\n500 ngml21 final concentration) were co-injected with CTX-1, following the\n\nsame protocol as described above for CTX alone. Uninjured or injured/regen-\n\nerating muscle tissue was isolated 1\u20135 days after injury. Whole muscle was\n\nprepared for cryosectioning and histological analysis, western blotting or for\n\nuse in culturing of isolated satellite cells in vitro.\n\nMuscle isolation and satellite-cell culture.Myofibre explants and satellite cells\nwere generated from C57 BL/6 mice as described previously3,11. Briefly, whole\n\nmuscle underwent enzymatic digestion at 37 uC in DMEM (Invitrogen)/1%\npenicillin\u2013streptomycin (Invitrogen)/125Uml21 Collagenase Type IIA\n\n(Sigma) solution. Bulk myofibres with associated satellite cells (located beneath\n\nthe basement membrane and above the plasma membrane) were purified away\n\nfrom muscle interstitial cells, tendons, etc. by multiple rounds of trituration,\n\nsedimentation and washing. Satellite cells were isolated from purified myofibres\n\nby subsequent enzymatic digestion with Collagenase Type IIA and Dispase\n\n(Sigma), followed by sedimentation, washing and fine-mesh straining proce-\n\ndures, as in refs 3 and 11. Purified satellite cells and satellite cell-stripped myo-\n\nfibres were used in subsequent experiments, as described below. The\n\napproximate 95% purity of satellite cells was routinely confirmed by generation\n\nof proliferating fusion-competent myoblasts after 24 h in growth medium\n\n(Ham\u2019s F-10 (Mediatech), 20% FBS (Mediatech), 5 ngml21 FGF (Chemicon)\n\nand 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin); and myotube formation after 48 h in DMEM,\n\n12% horse serum. The efficiency of satellite-cell depletion from myofibres was\n\nroutinely confirmed by the absence of such myogenic potential. Satellite cells\n\nwere cultured on ECM:PBS-coated plates (1:500; BD Biosciences).\n\nTranswell co-cultures of myofibres and satellite cells. Transwell co-cultures\n(1.0mm, Corning) were used for culturing isolated satellite cells with young or\noldmyofibres. Satellite cells were seeded onto ECM-coated plates inOPTI-MEM\n\n(Invitrogen),15%FBS. Transwell inserts, containing isolatedmyofibre explants\n\nfrom young or old muscle, were placed over satellite cells and cultured for 72\u2013\n\n96 h before lysing for western blot analysis (see below). Supernatants condi-\n\ntioned for 24 h, from both young and old control myofibre explants, were used\n\nto analyse secreted bioactive TGF-b1 levels (immunodetection of active protein)\nin ELISA-based cytokine antibody arrays (RayBiotech).\n\nWestern blot analysis.Myofibre and satellite-cell lysates were prepared in lysis\nbuffer (50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and\n\n1mMEDTA, pH 7.4). Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 1mMPMSFwere\n\nadded before use. Phosphatase activity was inhibited by 1mM sodium fluoride\n\nand 1mM sodium orthovanadate for pSmad immunodetection. Approximately\n\n30 mg protein extract were run on pre-cast SDS PAGE gels (Biorad). Primary\nantibodies were diluted in 5% non-fat milk/13PBST, and nitrocellulose mem-\n\nbranes were incubated with antibody mixtures overnight at 4 uC. HRP-conju-\ngated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech) were diluted 1:1,000 in\n\n13PBST/1% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were\n\ndeveloped using Western Lightning ECL reagent (Perkin Elmer), and analysed\n\nwith Bio-Rad Gel Doc/Chemi Doc Imaging System and Quantity One software.\n\nResults of multiple assays were quantified by digitizing the data and normalizing\n\npixel density of examined protein by actin-specific pixel density.\n\nImmunocytochemistry and histological analysis.Muscle tissue was treated in a\n25% sucrose/PBS solution, frozen in OCT compound (Tissue Tek), cryo-\n\nsectioned at 10 mm (Thermo Shandon Cryotome E) and immunostained as\npreviously described3,11. Immunostaining or haematoxylin and eosin staining\n\nwere performed on cryosections. For indirect immunoflourescence, sections\n\nwere permeabilized in (PBS,11% FBS,10.25% Triton X-100), incubated with\n\nprimary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in PBS,11%FBS, and then with\n\nfluorophore-conjugated, species-specific secondary antibodies for 1 h at room\n\ntemperature (1:500 in PBS, 11%FBS). pSmad3- and BrdU-specific immuno-\n\nstaining required additional nuclear permeabilization and DNA-chromatin\n\ndenaturation with 4N HCL. Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst staining for all\n\nimmunostains. Biologically active TGF-b and myostatin proteins (immuno-\ndetectible ligands cleaved from the latent complex)14,29 were also examined.\n\nSamples were analysed at room temperature with a Zeiss Axio Imager A1, and\n\nimaged with an Axiocam MRc camera and AxioVision software.\n\nIn vitro induction of cell-cycle regulators by TGF-b andmyostatin.Activated-\nby-injury satellite cells were isolated from injuredmuscle. Cells were seeded onto\n\nECM-coated, six-well plates at a uniform density of 1.23 105 cells per well, and\n\ncultured for 24 h in OPTI-MEM 11% mouse sera, containing various levels of\n\nTGF-b1 or myostatin. For Notch activation, ECM-coated plates were coated\nwith 2mgml21 Delta-4 (DLL4) overnight at 37 uC, before seeding satellite cells.\nAlternatively, Notch activation was induced by exposing satellite cells to 5mM\n\nEDTA for 15min at 37 uCbefore seeding. Cells lysateswere prepared andused for\nwestern blotting analysis (described above).\n\nshRNA delivery by lentiviral transduction. Young and old tibialis anterior and\ngastrocnemius muscles were infected, in vivo, with control non-target shRNA\n\n(Sigma SHC002V), GFP (Sigma SHC003V) or pLKO.1-puro (Sigma SHC001V)\n\ncontrol transduction lentiviral particles (at least 106 transducing units per mil-\n\nlilitre, as determined by p24 antigen ELISA titre). Mouse Smad3 shRNA-pro-\n\nducing lentiviral particles (also obtained from Sigma) were used for in vivo\n\ntransduction experiments (target-set generated from accession number\n\nNM_016769.2: (1) CCGGCCCATGTTTCTGCATGGATTTCTCGAGAAATCC\n\nATGCAGAAACATGGGTTTTTG; (2) CCGGCCTTACCACTATCAGAGAGTA\n\nCTCGAGTACTCTCTGATAGTGGTAAGGTTTTTG; (3) CCGGCTGTCCAA\n\nTGTCAACCGGAATCTCGAGATTCCGGTTGACATTGGACAGTTTTTG; (4)\n\nCCGGGCACACAATAACTTGGACCTACTCGAGTAGGTCCAAGTTATTGT-\n\nGTGCTTTTTG; (5) CCGGCATCCGTATGAGCTTCGTCAACTCGAGTTGAC\n\nGAAGCTCATACGGATGTTTTTG). shRNAs were used in a Smad3 shRNA\n\ncocktail (shRNAs 1\u20135), designated Smad3 shRNA-1, or individually\n\n(shRNA(2) designated Smad3 shRNA-2 and shRNA(3) designated Smad3\n\nshRNA-3). Skeletal muscle was infected by intramuscular injection of lentiviral\n\nparticles (about 50,000 TU) with a 28-gauge needle on multiple consecutive\n\ndays, before or coincident with CTX-1 injury. To examine cell proliferation,\n\n50 ml of 10mM BrdU was injected intraperitoneally at 3 days after injury.\nTissues were analysed for regenerative responses and transduction levels at 5\n\ndays after injury by cryo-sectioning of whole tissues, or western blotting of\n\nsatellite-cell lysates (described above). Transcript levels were analysed using\n\nSuperScript RT\u2013PCR kit (Invitrogen) for amplification of Smad3\n\n(F5CTGGCTACCTGAGTGAAGATGGAGA, R5AAAGACCTCCCCTCCG\n\nATGTAGTAG) and GAPDH (F5TGAGGCCGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTG,\n\nR5TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT). Amplification products (25\u201340\n\ncycles on BioRad iQ5) were examined and confirmed for predicted molecular\n\nmasses on EtBr-stained 2% agarose gels.\n\nChIP assays and RT\u2013qPCR/PCR. Isolated satellite cells were treated with TGF-\nb1 only, activation of Notch only, TGF-b1/Notch together, Notch inhibition\n(GSI) or untreated (as described above). After culture for 24 h, satellite cells were\n\nfixed with 1% PFA and ChIP assay was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s\n\nguidelines (Upstate). Fragments of about 500 base pairs were produced by shear-\n\ning DNA with attached proteins (confirmed by EtBr-stained gels), and precipi-\n\ntated with antibodies to DNA-bound protein. Proteins that co-precipitated\n\nwith pSmad3 were analysed by western blot, using indicated antibodies.\n\nDNA that co-precipitated with pSmad3 was analysed using primers specific\n\nfor the 59 gene regulatory regions of p15, p16, p21 and p27 (p15\n\nF5TCACCGAAGCTACTGGGTCT , R5GTTCAGGGCGTTGGGATCT; p16\n\nF5GTCACACGACTGGGCGATT, R5GTTGCCCATCATCATCACCT and\n\nF5GATGACTTCACCCCGTCACT, R5AACACCCCTGAAAACACTGC/GT\n\nCCCTCCTTCCTTCCTCTG; p21 F5CCGCGGTGTCAGAGTCTA, R5CAT\n\nGAGCGCATCGCAATC; p27 F5AGCCTACGCTCCGACTGTT, R5AGTT\n\nCTGCGACTGCACACAG and F5CTAGCCACCGAAGCTCCTAA, R5AGT\n\nTCTGCGACTGCACACAG and F5CTGGCTCTGCTCCATTTGAC, R5G\n\nGCTCCCGTTAGACACTCTC). GAPDH primers (see above) were used as con-\n\ntrol for Smad3 non-enriched genomic regions. Primers were designed with\n\nOligoPerfect Designer (Invitrogen). For RT\u2013qPCR, samples were analysed using\n\na Bio-Rad iQ5 real-time PCRdetection system,with iQ5 optical system software.\n\nFor PCR, samples were amplified with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase\n\n(Invitrogen) and analysed on a Bio-Rad iQ5 system. After 40\u201355 cycles of amp-\n\nlification, fragments produced from each primer set were examined and con-\n\nfirmed for their predicted molecular masses on EtBr-stained 2% agarose gels.\n\nFifty-five cycles of amplification were used for negative control PCR reactions.\n\nReagents.

In the present study, we extracted Dioscorea nipponica\nMakino with methanol (DNE1), chloroform (DNE2), ethyl acetate (DNE3), n-butanol (DNE4), and water (DNE5). We first\ndemonstrate that DNE3 was found to be effective in reducing the lung metastases formation by about 99.5% as compared to\nvehicle-treated control animals. When a nontoxic concentration of the extract was treated directly to highly metastatic murin\nmelanoma cells (B16F10) and human melanoma cells (A2058) in vitro, it exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the invasion\n(P < .001), motility (P < .001), secretion of MMPs (P < .001), and u-PA (P < .001) of both cell lines. To investigate the possible\nmechanisms involved in these events, we performed western blot analysis to find that DNE inhibited phosphorylation of Akt.\nA treatment with DNE3 to B16F10 cells also inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB and increased the expression of IkappaB. Taken\ntogether, these findings suggested that DNE3 could reduce the metastasis of melanoma cells, thereby constituting an adjuvant\ntreatment for metastasis control.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that a diet rich in\nvegetables and fruits might protect against cancer by mech-\nanisms that have not been well defined yet. In recent\nyears, naturally occurring plant products have been getting\nincreased attention for the intervention of malignant invasive\nprogression in the late stage of neoplastic diseases [1, 2].\nOn the basis of this idea, certain foods, including many\nvegetables, fruits, and grains, as well as phytochemicals of\ndiversified pharmacological efficacies have been shown to\noffer a significant protection against various cancers [3\u20135].\n\nFurthermore, there is an increase focus on providing sci-\nentific basis to use these agents in the prevention strategy\nfor people with a high risk for cancers. Dioscorea nipponica\nMakino has long been used as a folk medicine for bronchitis,\nasthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. These compounds were\neffective for preventing both the body and adipose tissue\nweight gains in rodents induced by a high-fat diet [6].\nHowever, limited studies are available concerning the effect\nof Dioscorea nipponica Makino in anticancer.\n\nInvasion and metastasis of solid tumor involves multiple\nprocesses and various cytophysiological changes, including\nchanged adhesion capability between cells and extracellular\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nDioscorea nipponica Makino 50 g\n\nH2O layer\n\nH2O layer\n\nH2O layer\n\nH2O layer\n\nExtract with CHCl3\n\nExtract with EtOAc CHCl3 layer\n(DNE2)\n\nEtOAc layer\n(DNE3)\n\nExtract with n-BuOH\n\nn-BuOH layer\n(DNE4)\n\nResidue\n\nExtract with MeOH\n\nMeOH layer\n(DNE1)\n\n(DNE5)\n\n(a)\n\nC\nel\n\nli\nnv\n\nas\nio\n\nn\n(c\n\non\ntr\n\nol\n%\n\n)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\nControl DNE1 DNE2 DNE3 DNE4 DNE5\n\n100 \u03bcg/mL\n\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\n\n\u2217\u2217\n\n(b)\n\nA\nU\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nP1\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n(minutes)\n\n(c)\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne\nab\n\nu\nn\n\nda\nn\n\nce\n\n200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600\n\n410.87\n\n392.97\n\n285.06 426.97\n\n291.05272.95231.17\n\n545.12243.08 303.09 503.01266.9 439.21203.03 594.35178.88 341.08 356.45\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n582.75438.81\n\nm/z\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 1: The chemical profile of Dioscorea nipponica extract was analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry.

A monoclonal\nantibody against plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) was\nobtained from American Diagnostics Inc. (Greenwich, CT,\nUSA). ECL Plus detection kit was obtained from Amersham\nLife Sciences, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Lightshift kit was\npurchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA).\n\n2.2. Preparation of Dioscorea nipponica Makino Extracts. Air-\ndried Dioscorea nipponica Makino (50 g) was extracted 3\ntimes with boiling water (500 mL) for 30 minutes, and\nthe filtrate was partitioned with chloroform (DNE2), ethyl\nacetate (DNE3), and n-butanol (DNE4), and the residue was\nextracted with methanol (DNE1). Afterwards, solvent was\nremoved by a vacuum rotary evaporator and these fractions\nwere lyophilized and stored at \u221220\u25e6C . Furthermore, the\nchemical profile of ethyl acetate soluble fraction was analyzed\nby using high-pressure liquid chromatograms- (HPLC-)-\nmass spectrometer. Briefly, DNE3 was analyzed by HPLC-\nmass spectrometer using a HPLC (Hitachi L-6200 with an\nL-4500 Diode Array detector) with a PE Sciex Qstar Pulsar\nESI-TOF mass spectrometer. Samples (10 \u03bcl) were injected\n\ninto a Merck LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (4\u00d7 250 mm).\nThe column was equilibrated in 0.05% acetic acid/water\n(solution A), and elution of the components was performed\nby increasing the concentration of acetonitrile (solution B)\nfrom 0% to 60% in 30 minutes at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nThe main product peak with a retention time of 16.644\nminutes was then subjected to electrospray ionisation mass\nspectra using multiply-charged ion profile based on the\nmodified method of Wong et al. [14].\n\n2.3. Cell Culture. Cell lines including A2058 from human\nmelanoma, B16F10 from a mouse melanoma, and HS68\nfrom a human foreskin fibroblast cells were obtained from\nAmerican Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA)\nand cultured in DMEM (for A2058 and B16F10) or RPMI\n(for HS68).\n\n2.4. Measurement of Lung Metastasis in B16F10-Bearing\nMice.

Results were statistically evaluated by using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett\u2019s test ( \u2217\u2217\u2217P < .001). Results from 3 repeated\nand separated experiments were similar.\n\naccess to standard rodent chow diet (Laboratory Rodent Diet\n5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO). Cells (2\u00d7105 cells) suspended\nin 0.1 mL of PBS were injected into the tail vain of C57BL/6\nmice. On the following day (Day 1), mice were randomly\ndivided into three groups (n = 8 for each group) to be\nfed by oral gavage with saline (control) or DNE3 (0.1 g/kg\nand 0.2 g/kg of body weight, daily). Five untreated mice\nwere used as wild type control. After 21 days, animals were\neuthanized with CO2. The lungs were isolated and weighed,\nand metastatic nodules on the surface of lungs were counted\nunder a microscopy. Lungs were fixed in neutral buffered\n5% formalin, and sections were taken and stained with\nhematoxyline and eosine for morphological studies [15].\n\n2.5. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). Cells were\ntreated with DNE3 (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) for 24\nhours. After treatment, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL\nMTT in culture medium for an additional 4 h, and the blue\nformazan crystals of viable cells were dissolved by lysis buffer\n(isopropyl alcohol containing 10% Triton X-100 and 0.1 N\nHCl) and measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm [4].\n\n2.6. Transwell Cell Invasion and Motility Assays. After a pre-\ntreatment with DNE3 for 24 hours, cells were harvested and\nseeded to BD Falcon cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences,\nBedford, MA, USA) at 5 \u00d7 104 cells/well in serum-free\nmedium and then incubated for another 12 h at 37\u25e6C. For\ninvasion assay, 100 \u03bcl Matrigel (1 mg/1 mL) was applied to\nthe membrane filters with a pore size of 8 \u03bcm and the bottom\nchamber contained standard medium. Filters were then air-\ndried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. The invaded cells were\n\nfixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. Cell numbers\nwere counted under a light microscope. The motility assay\nwas carried out as described in the invasion assay with no\ncoating of Matrigel [16].\n\n2.7. Wound Healing Migration Assay. Wounds were intro-\nduced to the confluent monolayer of cells with a yellow\nplastic pipette tip to create a cleared line. The medium was\nremoved and replaced with DMEM containing 1% FBS, and\nthen DNE3 was added. The cells were incubated at 37\u25e6C, and\ncell movement into the wound area was photographed at 0 h,\n24 hours and 48 hours using a microscope.\n\n2.8. Cell-Matrix Adhesion Assay. After a 24-hour treatment\nwith DNE3, cells were plated on 24-well dishes coated\nwith 150 \u03bcl type I collagen (10 \u03bcg/mL) and cultured for 30\nminutes. Nonadherent cells were removed by PBS washes and\nadherent cells were fixed in ethanol. After staining with 0.1%\ncrystal violet, fixed cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 and\nthe absorbance was measured at 550 nm [17].\n\n2.9. Determination of MMP-2, -9, and u-PA. In gelatin\nzymography, collected media were prepared with sodium\ndodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer without boiling or\nreduction and subjected to 0.1% gelatin-8% SDS polyacry-\nlamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to determine the\nMMPs. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5%\nTriton X-100 and then incubated in reaction buffer (40 mM\nTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3) for 16 h at\n37\u25e6C.

Effects of DNE on the Invasion of Human Melanoma Cells.\nTo evaluate the bioactive compound of Dioscorea nipponica\nMakino, we successively extracted the Dioscorea nippon-\nica with methanol (DNE1), chloroform (DNE2), ethyl\nacetate (DNE3), n-butanol (DNE4), and water (DNE5)\n(Figure 1(a)). B16F10 cells were treated with different\nDioscorea nipponica extracts, and a decrease of invasion was\ndetected by Transwell invasion assay. Among these extracts,\nDNE3 was the most effective Dioscorea nipponica ingredient\nthat reduces invasion activity in our assay (Figure 1(b)).\nChromatographic patterns from HPLC analysis of DNE3\nextracts showed peaks corresponding to the retention times.\nAbsorbance was monitored at 254 nm (Figure 1(c)). The\nmain product peak (P1) with a retention time of 16.644\nminutes as shown in Figure 1(c) was then subjected to\nelectrospray ionisation mass spectra using multiply-charged\nion profile (Figure 1(d)).\n\n3.2.

Condition media were\nsubjected to gelatin zymography and casein zymography to analyze the activities of MMPs (e) and u-PA (f), respectively. Data represented\nthe mean\u00b1 SD of at least 3 independent experiments. Results were statistically evaluated by using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett\u2019s\ntest ( \u2217P < .05; \u2217\u2217P < .01; \u2217\u2217\u2217P < .001).\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11\n\nB16F10 cells mainly form lung tumors. C57BL/6 mice were\ninjected via the tail vein with B16F10 melanoma cells, and\nadministration of the ethyl acetate extracts of DEN3 reduced\npulmonary metastasis formation of B16F10 cells. Within 21\ndays of injection, the control mice were visibly riddled with\nmetastatic tumor nodules compared with the lungs of DNE3\ntreated mice (Figure 2(a)). Mean lung weights for animals\nreceiving 0.1 g/kg/day DNE3 (0.1964 \u00b1 0.0594 g; P < .001)\nand 0.2 g/kg/day DNE3 (0.1240 \u00b1 0.0125 g; P < .001) were\nsignificantly lower than those from control animals (0.4570\u00b1\n0.1488 g; Figure 2(b)). Vehicle-treated control animals had\nmassive growth of tumor and was given an arbitrary-\nmaximum countable number about 275 \u00b1 45.3. It was\nreduced to 14 \u00b1 5.4 (0.1 g/kg/day; P < .001) and 1.2 \u00b1 1.7\n(0.2 g/kg/day; P < .001) countable colonies by DNE3\ntreatment (Figure 2(c)). The average body weight of DNE3\ntreated mice was higher than control group (Figure 2(d)).\nHistopathology of the lung also showed marked reduction in\ntumor mass in the lungs of DNE3-treated animals (Figure 3).\n\n3.3. Effect of DNE3 on Cell Viability. Results of MTT assay\nshowed that DNE3 has no cytotoxicity on B16F10 cells\n(Figure 4(a)). Results from same procedures performed on\nnormal human foreskin fibroblast cell lines, HS68, revealed\nthat this compound did not have any significant cytotoxicity\non these cells (Figure 4(b)).\n\n3.4. Effects of DNE3 on the Invasion, Motility, Migration, and\nAdhesion. Incubation of B16F10 with 1% FBS produced a\nmarked cell migration in the wound area 24 hours and\n48 hours after wounding whereas wounds treated with\nDNE3 showed significant delays in wound healing under the\nsame conditions (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). To screen for the\npreventive effectors against cancer metastasis, the inhibitory\neffect of DNE3 on invasion and motility of B16F10 cells\nwas examined with Transwell. The result showed that DNE3\nsignificantly reduced the motility and invasion of B16F10\ncells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 4(e) and\n4(f)).\n\nCancer cells, invading the host tissue, break from their\ncell-cell contacts and make new contact with the ECM.\nTherefore, DNE3 was tested to determine their effects on\nthe cell-matrix adhesion. The results showed that DNE3\nsignificantly reduced the cell-matrix interactions of B16F10\ncells (Figure 4(g)).\n\n3.5. Effects of DNE3 on the Activities of MMP-2, u-PA,\nand TIMP-2. Via gelatin and casein zymography assays,\nrespectively, it has been shown that DNE3 significantly\nreduced MMP-2 (Figure 5(a)) and u-PA (Figure 5(b)) activ-\nity in dose-dependent manner. The immunoblotting showed\nthat MMP-2 protein level was gradually decreased along\nwith the concentration of DNE3 (Figure 5(c)). Physiological\nactivity of MMP-2 is greatly related to that of their specific\nendogenous inhibitors, TIMP-2, therefore western blotting\nwas employed to see the effect of DNE3 on TIMP-2\nexpression, and results showed that TIMP-2 protein levels\n\nwere significantly increased along with the concentration of\nDNE3 in B16F10 (Figure 5(d)).\n\n3.6. The Inhibition of Akt Phosphorylation by DNE3. The\nimmunoblotting showed that PI3K protein level was grad-\nually decreased along with the concentration of DNE3\n(Figure 6(a)). DNE3 significantly inhibited the activation of\nAkt as evidenced by a decrease in the levels of phospho-Akt\nproteins in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6(b)) whereas\nit has no significant effect on p38 and ERK1/2 activity\n(Figures 6(c) and 6(d)).\n\n3.7. Effects of DNE3 on the Activation of NF-\u03baB, c-Jun, and c-\nFos. To examine the effect of DNE3 on the activation of NF-\n\u03baB and AP-1, B16F10 cells were treated with DNE3 for 24\nhours. Nuclear extract was analyzed by EMSA for AP-1 and\nNF-\u03baB DNA binding activity, and results showed that DNA\nbinding activity of NF-\u03baB (Figure 7(a)) was significantly\ninhibited by a treatment with 100 \u03bcg/mL DNE3 whereas the\nAP-1 activity was unchanged (Figure 7(b)). Subsequently,\nwestern blot was performed to further confirm these results,\nand it was found that a pretreatment of DNE3 suppressed the\nnuclear levels of NF-\u03baB while it has no significant effect on\nthe c-Jun and c-Fos expression, with C23 being the internal\ncontrol (Figure 7(c)). The activity of NF-\u03baB is related to\nthat of their endogenous inhibitors, IkappaB (I\u03baB), therefore\nWestern blotting was employed to see the effect of DNE3 on\nI\u03baB expression, and results showed that I\u03baB protein levels\nwere significantly increased along with the concentration of\nDNE3 (Figure 7(d)).\n\n3.8. DNE3 Inhibit Invasion and MMP-2 and u-PA Secretion\nin Human Melanoma Cell Lines. Similar experiments were\nperformed, using human melanoma cells, A2058, in order to\ndetermine if the anti-invasive activity of DNE3 can generally\nbe applicable to other types of melanoma cells. DNE3\ninhibited the motility (Figures 8(a) and 8(c)) and invasion\n(Figures 8(b) and 8(d)) of A2058 cell lines, and DNE3 clearly\ninhibited the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9 (Figure 8(e)),\nand u-PA (Figure 8(f)), thus indicating that DNE3 might\nhave anti-invasive properties against a broad spectrum of\nmelanoma cells.\n\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n\nChemopreventive properties have long been attributed to\nphenolic compounds present in the human diet and are\nthe use of agents to delay, inhibit, or reverse tumorigenesis.\nThese natural substances are of interest as they are potential\nsources of anticancer compounds with minimal debilitating\ntoxicity and side effects [19\u201321]. In the present study,\nwe demonstrated that Dioscorea nipponica are effective in\nvarious aspects of tumor formation in the B16F10 mouse\nmelanoma model in vitro. This model was chosen on the\nbasis of aggressive behavior and high metastatic potential\nof this cell line. One day after the intravenous injection of\ntumor cells, mice were treated with daily oral administration\n\n\n\n12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nof the DNE3 and resulted in a significant, dose-dependent\ndelay in lung colonization.\n\nThe metastatic process comprises a series of complicated\nevents that can be subdivided into a number of steps involv-\ning cell motility, cell invasion, surface adhesion properties,\nand degradation of ECM. Thus, in the present study, we tried\nto investigate the antimetastatic activity of DNE3 associated\nwith tumor thrombosis by tumor cell invasion, migration,\nadhesion, and proteinase expression.\n\nAdhesive interaction of tumor cells to ECM and its inva-\nsive action into ECM are known to be fundamental events\nin tumor metastatic process [22]. Here, DNE3 inhibited the\nadhesion of B16-F10 cells to type I collagen, one of the ECM\ncomponents, as well as effectively suppressed the invasion of\nB16-F10 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\nThe secretion of extracellular proteases plays an impor-\ntant role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis [23]. Of\nthese proteases, MMPs, a family of zinc-dependent ECM-\ndegrading enzymes, are involved in invasion, migration,\nand angiogenesis in tumor cells. There have been reports\nsuggesting that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9\ncorrelates with the progression of various types of tumors\n[24]. In addition to MMPs, the serine protease u-PA\nconverts inactive plasminogen into plasmin and therefore\nplays a key role to initiate a cascade of proteolytic steps\naccumulating in the degradation of the extracellular matrix.\nu-PA is found in cellular structures at the leading edge of\nmigrating cells that are involved in cell adhesion, migration,\ninvasion, and metastatsis [25]. MMP-2 is a proteolytic\nenzyme capable of degrading the structural support network\nfor normal and malignant cells, and their expression and\nactivity against matrix macromolecules have been shown\nto overbalance their endogenous inhibitors. TIMP-2 has\nbeen shown to suppress tumor growth and metastatic\npotential in cell and animal model systems [26]. The\ndata presented here demonstrated that DNE3 inhibits the\ninvasion of melanoma cancer cells and this inhibitory activity\nappeared to be dependent on the decreased expression of\nMMP-2, MMP-9, and u-PA, while that of TIMP-2 was\nenhanced.\n\nThe role of PI3K-Akt and MAPKs pathways in the\nregulation of u-PA or MMPs expressions in carcinoma\ncells has been well studied [23]. It has been shown that\nan inhibition of p-Akt may lead to a reduction in the\nexpression of MMP-2 or u-PA as well as in the invasion\nof tumor cells. As shown in Figure 6, DNE3 could reduse\nthe phosphorylation of Akt in B16-F10 cells. To make a\nlinkage between p-Akt and protease expressions, the effects\nof DNE3 on several transcription factors were examined. It\nis well known that the activation of AP-1 and NF-\u03baB and\nthe downstream of the PI3K-Akt pathway are associated with\ninflammation, cell invasion, migration, and angiogenesis\n[27], and that suppression of any of these transcription\nfactors is potentially an effective means to block tumor\ninvasion or metastasis, as well as blocking the factors that\nbind to these regulatory elements, and therefore represents\nan appropriate approach to inhibit the synthesis of MMPs or\nu-PA. In our studies, DNE3 was found to effectively suppress\nthe DNA binding activity and the expression of NF-\u03baB while\n\nthe protein level of I\u03baB, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-\n\u03baB, was gradually increased along with the concentration of\nDNE3.\n\nThe major drawbacks of many effective cancer chemo-\ntherapeutic agents are systemic toxicity and drug resistance.\nIn this regard, dietary supplement as well as phytotherapeutic\nagents with high anticancer activity and less toxicity to\nnormal tissues has been suggested as possible candidates\nfor their capability to improve the efficacy of anticancer\ndrugs [28, 29]. In the present study, HS68, human foreskin\nfibroblast cells, was used to demonstrate that DNE3 exerted\nno cytotoxicity on normal foreskin fibroblast cells. In\nconclusion, Dioscorea nipponica potently inhibits melanoma\ninvasive and metastatic potential; therefore, they may consti-\ntute a valuable tool in the combination therapy of metastatic\nmelanoma and in the prevention of melanoma metastases.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by Grants of the National Science\nCouncil, Taiwan (NSC 98-2313-B-166-004-MY3 and NSC\n98-2313-B-040-004-MY3).

Although\n\nmuch is known about HBV structure and replicative cycle [2] the\n\npathogenic mechanisms responsible for liver injury, cirrhosis\n\ndevelopment and malignant transformation during chronic HBV\n\ninfection are not well understood. It is believed that these events\n\noriginate from persistent immune pathogenesis [3], but observa-\n\ntions in transgenic mouse models of HBV infection suggest that in\n\nabsence of an adaptive immune responses cellular mechanisms\n\ninduced by HBV proteins may also lead to the development of\n\nthese liver diseases [4,5].\n\nThe HBV transgenic mice used in the current study contain a\n\nsub-genomic HBV DNA fragment (genotype D, subtype ayw)\n\nencoding the three co-carboxyterminal HBV surface (HBs)\n\nproteins under the control of the liver-specific murine albumin\n\npromoter [6]. Although these transgenic mice have been shown to\n\ndevelop chronic liver injury, regenerative hyperplasia, as well as\n\nadenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) [7,8] the\n\nmechanisms of HBs proteins pathogenicity are poorly understood.\n\nThe HBs protein expression pattern in this mouse model mimics\n\nthe situation in the liver of patients with enhanced intracellular\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\nexpression and retention of Hepatitis B virus surface proteins, e. g.\n\npatients with Hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treated\n\nby transplantation. The liver damage in these patients was\n\nattributable to a direct hepatocytotoxic effect of HBV, since they\n\nwere on a similar immunosuppresion regime [9,10].\n\nAccumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates the\n\nunfolded protein response (UPR) that is sensed by the binding\n\nimmunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78\n\n(GRP78) [11\u201313]. Distinct branches of UPR are mediated by\n\nthree different classes of ER-membrane transducers: inositol-\n\nrequiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6\n\n(ATF6) or protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase\n\n(PERK). PERK activation causes the phosphorylation of the\n\nalpha subunit of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 (eIF2a)\n[11]. Phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to a reduction in the\ninitiation of mRNA translation thus reducing the load of new\n\nproteins that require folding in the ER. However, the expression of\n\nsome proteins is enhanced. One of them is the C/EBP\n\nhomologous protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest and\n\nDNA damage-inducible gene (GADD) 153 that mediates pro-\n\napoptotic pathways emanating from the stressed ER [11,14].\n\nPreviously it was shown that GRP78 expression was increased in a\n\nhuman hepatoma cell line that overproduced HBs proteins [15]\n\nand in the liver of transgenic mice that expressed deletion mutant\n\nof large HBs [16].\n\nHepatic fibrosis constitutes the wound healing response to liver\n\ninjury. During fibrosis, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation\n\nrepresents a critical event, because these cells become the primary\n\nsource of extracellular matrix in the liver upon damage [17].\n\nDevelopment of hepatic fibrosis after chemical liver injury is\n\nenhanced in BALB/c mice exhibiting a Th2 response compared to\n\nC57BL/6 mice, which demonstrated a primary Th1 response\n\n[18]. Transgenic mice on fibrosis-resistant C57BL/6 genetic\n\nbackground, which over-produce HBs proteins, develop modest\n\nspontaneous liver fibrosis [19,20].\n\nTranscription factor c-Jun and signal transducer and activator\n\nof transcription (STAT) 3 are implicated in several cellular\n\nprocesses including proliferation, survival, and cell transformation\n\n[21,22]. They are activated in chemically induced murine liver\n\ntumours and in HCCs of humans [23,24], suggesting an important\n\nfunction for these proteins in the development of liver tumours.\n\nHere we report that the production of HBV surface proteins\n\nstimulates the expression of CHOP in hepatocytes and could cause\n\nstronger liver damage in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic\n\nbackground compared to C57BL/6. Furthermore, HBV trans-\n\ngenic mice develop hepatic fibrosis and the level of fibrosis\n\ndepends on the genetic background. Although c-Jun transcription\n\nfactor up-regulation and activation of STAT3 and PERK in the\n\nliver of transgenic mice might contribute to tumour development,\n\nCHOP expression might reduce tumorigenesis in transgenic mice\n\non BALB/c genetic background.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimal Model\nTransgenic mice were maintained at the Central Animal\n\nLaboratory of the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen under specified\n\npathogen-free conditions. This study was carried out in strict\n\naccordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care\n\nand Use of Laboratory Animals of the German law of animal\n\nwelfare. The mice received humane care, and all experiments\n\nwere approved by the Committee on the ethics of Animal\n\nExperiments of the Regierungspraesidium Giessen, Giessen,\n\nGermany (permit number: V54-19c 20 15 h 01 GI20/10 Nr.\n\n52/2011 and Nr. A5/2012).\n\nGeneration and characteristics of transgenic lineages Tg(Alb-\n\n1HBV), internal designation (HBVTg/6) have been described\n\npreviously [8]. The HBVTg/6 strain had an inbred C57BL/6\n\ngenetic background and was propagated by crossing hemizygous\n\ntransgenic males to C57BL/6 females. These mice were\n\nbackcrossed to fibrosis susceptible BALB/c genetic background\n\n[18] for at least 6 generations. The obtained transgenic mouse line\n\nwas internally designed HBVTg/c. At age of 12, 26, and 52 weeks\n\nmice were killed by CO2-inhalation. Liver samples were collected\n\nand preserved for analyses in accordance with application. Serum\n\nsamples were stored at 280uC until analysis of alanine amino-\ntransferase (ALT) by routine clinical chemistry on a Reflotron Plus\n\nAnalyzer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).\n\nHistology and Hydroxyproline Assay\nImmediately after necropsy, liver samples for histology were\n\nfixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde at 4uC for 16\nhours and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 mm) were\nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or 0.1% Sirius Red\n\nF3B in saturated picric acid (Chroma, Mu\u0308nster, Germany) for the\n\ndetection of collagen fibers [25]. The entire content of collagen\n\nwas determined by hydroxyproline (HYP) quantification [26].\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using ImmPRESS\n\nPeroxidase Detection Reagents (Vector Laboratories) and anti-\n\nbodies specific for HBsAg (20-HR20), GADD153 (F-168, Santa\n\nCruz), Desmin and GFAP (Lab Vision), c-Jun (60A8, Cell\n\nSignaling), BiP (C50B12, Cell Signaling). Colour reaction was\n\ndeveloped with VECTOR VIP Peroxidase Substrate Kit or DAB\n\nPeroxidase Substrate Kit, (Vector Laboratories). The percentage\n\nof BiP, Desmin, and GFAP-positive area was determined using\n\nImageJ image analysis system (National Institutes of Health,\n\nBethesda, MD, USA).\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nTotal liver lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using\n\nantibodies against HBsAg (20-HR20, Fitzgerald), GADD153 (F-\n\n168, Santa Cruz), phospho-PERK (16F8, Cell Signaling), PERK\n\n(H-300, Santa Cruz), phospho-eIF2a (119A11, Cell Signaling),\neIF2a (L57A5, Cell Signaling), b-actin (13E5, Cell Signaling),\nJNK2 (N-18, Santa Cruz), c-Jun (60A8, Cell Signaling), phospho-\n\nc-Jun (D47G9, Cell Signaling), phospho-SAPK/JNK (81E11, Cell\n\nSignaling), STAT3 (79D7, Cell Signaling), phospho-STAT3\n\n(D3A7, Cell Signaling).\n\nAssay for HBV-specific proteins\nHBsAg was measured in serum and in liver lysates by an in-\n\nhouse sandwich ELISA as described [27]. HBsAg amount per\n\nhepatocyte was calculated based on the hepatocellularity number\n\nfor mouse 135 million cells per gram of liver [28].\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)\nRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR and quality control of all\n\nsteps were performed as described previously [29]. Primers were\n\npurchased from QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany). qPCR data were\n\nanalysed using DDCt method [30].\n\nMicroarray analysis\nMicroarray experiments were performed with total RNA from\n\nthe liver of 12-week-old mice as described previously [31]. The\n\nPathological Impact of HBV Surface Proteins\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608\n\n\n\ndata presented here have been deposited in NCBI\u2019s Gene\n\nExpression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)\n\nand are accessible through GEO Series accession number\n\nGSE40826.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS V.17.0 software\n\n(SPSS Inc.). For non-normally distributed parameters, Mann-\n\nWhitney U test and Spearman rank test were applied. The results\n\nare presented as mean6SEM. A two-sided p,0.05 was considered\n\nsignificant (shown as * in the figures].\n\nResults\n\nLiver damage induced by HBs proteins expression\ndepends on host genetic background\n\nTransgenic mice were sacrificed at week 12, 26, and 52. To\n\nestimate the level of liver cell damage we have measured alanine\n\ntransaminase (ALT) in serum. Activities of serum ALT were\n\nmarkedly increased already in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice\n\ncompared to the wild-type and remained at that level during the\n\nobservation period. In HBVTg/6 mice the ALT elevation was\n\nmoderate at week 12 but increased later to levels almost as high as\n\nin HBVTg/c mice (Figure 1A). Histological analysis revealed no\n\nsignificant lymphocyte infiltration of the liver from 12-week-old\n\ntransgenic mice (Figure S1A). Furthermore, amounts of HBsAg\n\nper hepatocyte in 12-week-old mice were similar: 0.42 pg/cell\n\n(range, 0.18\u20130.71 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and 0.31 pg/cell\n\n(range, 0.15\u20130.64 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/6. Immunohisto-\n\nchemical and Western blot analyses of livers from transgenic mice\n\nalso showed that distributions and expression levels of HBs\n\nproteins were similar in mice on both C57BL/6 and BALB/c\n\ngenetic backgrounds (Figure S1B and S2). Moreover, amounts of\n\nHBsAg in serum of transgenic mice did not differ significantly:\n\n2.02 ng/ml (range, 0.68\u20133.19 ng/ml; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and\n\n1.34 ng/ml (range, 0.68\u20132.55 ng/ml; n = 4) for HBVTg/6. Thus,\n\nthe elevated serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice could be a\n\nconsequence of a specific host response to the presence of HBs\n\nproteins.\n\nTo identify the pathways which are activated in the HBs-\n\nexpressing liver tissue we carried out transcriptional profiling using\n\nmicroarray analysis. As illustrated in Table 1 a set of genes that is\n\nknown to be induced by UPR is up-regulated in the liver of 12-\n\nweek-old transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression of gene\n\nddit3 that encodes CHOP protein is stronger up-regulated in the\n\nliver of HBVTg/c mice compared to HBVTg/6. To confirm this\n\nfinding we studied the expression of CHOP by qRT-PCR and\n\nWestern blot analysis. Transcription of the ddit3 gene was strongly\n\nactivated in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice and declined thereafter\n\nwith age, whereas in HBVTg/6 mice ddit3 transcription was rather\n\nweakly enhanced in 12-week-old mice and increased with age\n\n(Figure S3). Western blot analysis of liver proteins revealed that\n\nCHOP was up-regulated much stronger in HBVTg/c mice\n\ncompared to HBVTg/6 (Fig. 1B). Selective CHOP translation\n\ndepends on eIF2a phosphorylation by PERK after induction of\nUPR [11]. However, we detected similar level of PERK activation\n\nand eIF2a phosphorylation in the liver from both mouse strains\nirrespective of gender and age (Fig. 1C and D). Interestingly, other\n\nUPR sensors ATF6 and IRE1 as well as eIF2a kinases PKR\n(protein kinase R) and GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2)\n\n[32] were not activated in the liver of transgenic mice (data not\n\nshown). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of\n\ntransgenic mice leads to the specific activation of the PERK\n\nbranch of UPR in hepatocytes from both mouse strains, but\n\nexpression of CHOP was much stronger in HBVTg/c mice.\n\nEnhanced translation of CHOP results in liver damage and could\n\nexplain higher serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice.\n\nTo examine the location of CHOP expressing hepatocytes\n\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. According to our\n\nprevious finding a significant part of hepatocytes from 12-week-old\n\nHBVTg/c mice accumulated CHOP in the nucleus and the\n\namount of CHOP-positive hepatocytes declined with age, whereas\n\nwe could detect only a few hepatocytes in HBVTg/6 liver\n\npositively stained for CHOP independent of age (Figure 2A).\n\nInteresting, CHOP-positive hepatocytes were located in centri-\n\nlobular areas which surround a hepatic central vein (Figure 2A).\n\nFurthermore, induction of UPR leads to activation of the major\n\nsensor of unfolded protein accumulation BiP/GRP78 [12]. IHC\n\ndemonstrated strong expression of BiP in selected hepatocytes in\n\ncentrilobular areas (Figure 2B and Figure S4), although Western\n\nblot analysis did not reveal any differences between wild-type and\n\ntransgenic mice in expression of BiP/GRP78 (data not shown).\n\nThus, expression of HBs proteins activated the UPR downstream\n\npathway (CHOP and BiP) much stronger in the liver of transgenic\n\nmice on BALB/c genetic background compared to C57BL/6.\n\nThis activation is located in centrilobular zones of the liver.\n\nLiver fibrosis\nMeasurement of liver hydroxyproline content demonstrated the\n\ndevelopment of hepatic fibrosis in transgenic mice (Figure 3A).\n\nEnhanced hepatic fibrosis was confirmed by Sirius red staining as\n\nwell. We observed minimal fibrosis in the liver of 12-week-old\n\nmice. But fibrosis constantly increased with age. However,\n\nHBVTg/c mice accumulated more collagen (Figure S5). Hepatic\n\nstellate cells (HSC) are the primary effector cells responsible for the\n\ndeposition of ECM in normal and fibrotic liver [33]. Therefore,\n\nwe tested the expression of HSC activation markers. We detected\n\nincreased amounts of GFAP- and desmin- positive cells in the liver\n\nof transgenic mice, thus demonstrating HSC proliferation in the\n\nliver of transgenic mice (Figure 3B and Figure S6). Moreover,\n\ndouble staining of desmin with specific antibodies and collagen\n\nwith Sirius red has shown co-localization of HSCs with collagen\n\nfibres (Figure S7). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in\n\nmouse liver induces development of hepatic fibrosis, which\n\ncorrelated with liver injury. HSCs might be the main collagen-\n\nproducing cells in this mouse model.\n\nHBs protein-induced tumour development depends on\nhost genetic background\n\nMicroarray analysis showed an up-regulation of c-jun gene\n\nexpression in transgenic mice independent of genetic background\n\n(Table 1). These results were confirmed using qPCR. Maximal\n\nexpression was detected in the liver of 52-week-old mice (Figure\n\nS8). Expression of c-Jun protein was increased in the liver of 12-,\n\n26-, and 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4A). Major parts of\n\nhepatocytes of 52-week-old mice accumulated c-Jun in the nucleus\n\n(Figure S9). Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinase\n\n(JNK) stimulates its ability to activate transcription [34,35].\n\nWestern blot analyses demonstrated that JNKs were activated\n\n(Figure 4B) and the level of c-Jun phosphorylation was indeed\n\nincreased in the liver of 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4C).\n\nThus, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of transgenic mice\n\nleads to activation of c-Jun expression.\n\nSTAT3 activation was observed in mouse models of liver injury\n\nand in human liver diseases in the context of inflammation and\n\ncancer [22]. Therefore, we examined the status of STAT3\n\nactivation in the liver of HBV transgenic mice. Western blot\n\nanalysis of liver protein extracts revealed STAT3 activation in the\n\nPathological Impact of HBV Surface Proteins\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608\n\n\n\nliver of male but not female mice (Figure 4D). Thus, expression of\n\nHBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice results in\n\nSTAT3 activation in a gender-dependent manner.\n\nUp-regulation of c-Jun expression and STAT3 activation could\n\npromote hepatic tumour growth [21,22]. We checked transgenic\n\nmice for occurrence of liver tumour. In young mice (12- and 26-\n\nweek-old) mice we could detect no tumours. However, they were\n\ndetected in 100% (6/6) of 52-week-old male and 20% (1/5) of\n\nfemale HBVTg/6 mice, whereas only 58% (7/12; X2 = 3.46;\n\np = 0.06) of 52-week-old male and 0% (0/6) of female HBVTg/c\n\nmice develop tumours. Hence, development of tumours in HBV\n\ntransgenic mice was age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study we investigated the effects of HBVs proteins\n\nexpression in the liver of transgenic mice BALB/c and C57BL/6\n\ngenetic background. Since we observed only weak strain-\n\nindependent immune cell infiltration of transgenic mice liver\n\n(Figure S1) this model could be considered as one with impaired\n\nimmune reaction. One important negative impact of immune\n\ndeficiency on chronic HBV infection in human is related to the\n\ndirect cytotoxicity of high levels of HBs and other HBV proteins\n\n[9,10,36]. Low serum HBsAG titers were associated with strong\n\nintracellular accumulation of HBs in HBV transgenic mice on\n\nboth genetic backgrounds. This condition was also seen in some\n\npatients with late phases of chronic HBV infection [37,38]. Thus,\n\ntransgenic mice expressing HBs proteins reflect the situation in the\n\nliver of HBV-infected patients demonstrated strong retention of\n\nHBsAg in hepatocytes.\n\nHigher serum ALT activities in HBVTg/c mice suggest\n\nstronger liver injury compared to HBVTg/6 (Figure 1A). Since\n\nthe level of cellular infiltration was low in the liver of transgenic\n\nmice on both genetic backgrounds we searched for other reasons\n\nof hepatocyte death. Increased CHOP expression as a result of\n\nprolonged ER stress promotes cell death, whereas CHOP deletion\n\nprotects against the death of ER-stressed cells [14]. Strongly\n\nincreased transcription and protein accumulation of CHOP in\n\nHBVTg/c mice (Figure 1B and 2A; Figure S3) inducing\n\nhepatocyte death could explain increased serum ALT level in\n\nthese mice. Expression of CHOP is mediated by phosphorylation\n\nof eIF2a [32] that in turn is phosphorylated by PERK [11].\nInterestingly, levels of PERK activation and eIF2a phosphoryla-\ntion were similar in the liver of both HBV transgenic mouse strains\n\n(Figure 1C and 1D). Two other branches of UPR IRE1a and\nATF6 were not activated in the liver of HBV transgenic mice (data\n\nnot shown). PERK branch activation is largely sustained with\n\nunmitigated ER stress, whereas persistent ER stress attenuates\n\nIRE1a and ATF6 signaling [39]. Therefore, permanent expres-\nsion of HBs proteins leads to the activation of persistent ER stress\n\nin hepatocytes that induces PERK and impairs another branches\n\nFigure 1.

It is possible that this situation is common for chronic\n\nliver disease comprising ER stress induction.\n\nIt was previously shown that despite PERK activation and\n\neIF2a phosphorylation in the liver of patients with nonalcoholic\nfatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\n\n(NASH), downstream effectors such as CHOP remain inactive\n\n[40]. A similar situation was observed in the liver of HBV\n\ntransgenic mice on C57BL/6 genetic background. However,\n\nstimulation of CHOP and BiP expression in HBVTg/c mice\n\ndemonstrated that the outcome of UPR induction depends on the\n\ngenetic background of subjects. Furthermore, several studies have\n\ndemonstrated that PERK function is critical for maintaining\n\ncellular redox homeostasis, promotes cancer cell proliferation and\n\ntumour growth [41]. Thus, sustained activation of PERK could\n\nalso promote cancer development in the liver of HBV transgenic\n\nmice.\n\nGlobal reduction of translation initiation due to PERK-\n\nmediated eIF2a phosphorylation [32] should also affect the\nexpression of HBs proteins in the liver. This suggests the following\n\nfeed-back mechanism: PERK activation results in the reduction of\n\nHBs translation and that leads to a balance between PERK\n\nactivation and HBs protein synthesis in hepatocytes.\n\nDevelopment of tumours in HBV transgenic mice as it was\n\nshown by us and others [8] is age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.\n\nIn this study we observed a strong up-regulation of c-Jun hepatic\n\nexpression and an activation of STAT3, whose role in tumori-\n\ngenesis is well established [22,23,42]. Jun controls liver cancer\n\ninitiation and is required for development of chemically induced\n\nHCC [23]. Interestingly, transgenic mice comprising the whole or\n\npartial HBV genome are also more susceptible to chemically\n\ninduced hepatocarcinogenesis [43,44]. Likewise, hepatitis C virus\n\ncore protein potentiates chemically induced HCC through c-Jun\n\nand STAT3 activation [45]. Thus, stimulation of c-Jun expression\n\nand STAT3 activation by HBs proteins could promote the\n\ndevelopment of liver cancer induced by different causes, such as\n\nsustained inflammation, activation of oncogenes etc. Furthermore,\n\nthe finding that STAT3 was activated in male mice only correlated\n\nwith our observation that tumour development in HBV transgenic\n\nmice is gender-dependent. There is accumulating evidence that\n\ntumour-specific ER stress can be exploited for cancer therapy by\n\ntreatment with ER stress-aggravating compounds [46]. Moderate,\n\ntransient ER stress response represents an adaptive mechanism to\n\nsupport cellular survival. However, severe and excessive stress\n\nconditions could turn this response system to its pro-apoptotic\n\nmode. Stimulation of CHOP expression in HBVTg/c mice\n\nindicated an activation of pro-apoptotic cellular stress responses in\n\nthe liver and resulted in reduced tumour incidence in 52-week-old\n\nHBVTg/c mice.\n\nTaken together, the outcome of HBV surface proteins\n\nexpression in the liver of transgenic mice depends on the host\n\ngenetic background. Liver injury and fibrosis were increased in\n\ntransgenic mice on BALB/c background compared to C57BL/6\n\ncorrelating with strong expression of PERK downstream pro-\n\napoptotic effector CHOP. More interesting finding is genetic\n\nbackground-independent stimulation of c-Jun expression together\n\nwith STAT3 and PERK activation promoting cancer cell\n\nproliferation and tumour growth. However, activation of pro-\n\napoptotic cellular stress response could result in reduced tumour\n\nincidence in the liver.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Representative liver histology and distribu-\ntion of HBs proteins in hepatocytes of transgenic mice.\n(A) H&E staining of liver sections from 12-, 26-, and 52-week-old\n\nmice HBVTg/c and HBVTg/6 mice.

The last naturally occurring case\nin the world was in Somalia in 1977.  Variola virus\n(smallpox virus) caused smallpox infection.  Except for\nlaboratory stockpiles, the variola virus has been elimi-\nnated.  However, there is heightened concern that the\nvariola virus might be used as an agent of bioterrorism\nor biowarfare.  Therefore, the government of each\ncountry is taking precautions for dealing with a small-\npox outbreak.  Smallpox is a serious, contagious, and\nsometimes fatal disease.  Although the only prevention\nis vaccination, routine vaccination among the general\npublic was stopped.  There is no specific treatment for\nthe smallpox disease.\n\nConfirmation of a smallpox outbreak requires diag-\nnosis.  Laboratory diagnostic testing for the variola\nvirus has been conducted by serological assays, negative\nstain electron microscopy (EM) identification, or isola-\ntion of the variola virus from a clinical specimen.\nRecently, diagnosis has been performed by polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) (2, 4, 16, 22), restriction fragment\nlength polymorphism (19), microarrays (17) and the\nsequencing (23) of viral DNA.  Genetic diagnosis has a\nhigh sensitivity and specificity, but might be costly,\ncomplicated and time-consuming.

To establish the possible diagnosis for\nsmallpox infection, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against VV and CPV were produced. The cross-reac-\ntivity of seven MAbs with cells infected with various strains of the orthopoxviruses (CPV, VV and EV) was\nconfirmed by an immunofluorescence (IF) test and other immunological analyses. Four and three MAbs\nreacted with the common antigen of all poxviruses (probably NP antigen) and the antigen involved in neu-\ntralization, respectively. We developed the IF test using these MAbs. The direct IF test required only 45\nmin to perform. Smallpox infection is now eradicated, but it is important to prepare for the diagnosis of\nsmallpox in an emergency. The direct IF assay using MAbs cross-reactive with orthopoxviruses is rapid,\nsimple, specific, applicable for multiple samples, and will make it possible to screen for and detect\northopoxviruses that include variola virus with tissue impression smears from skin lesions in most labora-\ntories or institutes.\n\nKey words: Monoclonal antibody, Smallpox, Rapid diagnosis, Cross-reactivity\n\n219\n\nMicrobiol.

Several major\nantigens have been shown to be induced in cells infected\nwith CPV and VV, i.e., the nucleoprotein (NP) antigen\n(24, 29), neutralization (NT)-associated antigen (21)\nand A-type inclusions (ATI) (7\u20139).  We have identified\nthe polypeptides of the major antigens by immunopre-\ncipitation (IP) with polyclonal antibodies (5, 6) and\nidentified those antigens by IP and immunoblotting\n(western blotting, WB) with a monoclonal antibody\n(MAb) (11\u201313).  The NP is a so-called common antigen\nthat shows cross-reactivity with cells infected with\neither an Orthopoxvirus such as CPV, EV and VV, or a\nLeporipoxvirus such as the Shope fibroma virus (SFV).\nThe NT antigen shows cross-reactivity with cells infect-\ned with the Orthopoxvirus such as CPV, EV and VV.\nOn the other hand, the ATI are seen in cells infected\nonly with an Orthopoxvirus such as CPV or EV.\n\nIn this study, we newly produced MAbs cross-reacted\nwith the orthopoxviruses, and examined the develop-\nment of simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic screening\nfor the multiple tissue impression smears infected with\northopoxviruses that include the smallpox virus.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nViruses and cells.  RK13 cells derived from rabbit\nkidney cells, HeLa cells derived from a human carcino-\nma and L cells derived from mouse fibroblasts were\ngrown in minimum essential medium supplemented\nwith 5% calf serum (MEM-CS).  The strains of CPV\nwere the LB red, Amsterdam, 53, 58 and 60 strains, the\nEV strains were Ishibashi and Hampstead, the VV\nstrains were Ikeda, Lister, IHD-W and IHD-J, and the\nSFV strain was OA (5, 6, 11\u201313).  The RK13 or HeLa\ncells were infected with CPV, VV or SFV, and the\nHeLa or L cells were infected with EV.  Tissue samples\ninfected with Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV)\nwere kindly provided by Dr.  Kenji Hiroi (Hiroi Derma-\ntologic Hospital, Osaka, Japan).\n\nProduction of hybridoma.  The methods for the pro-\nduction and culture of the hybridomas and the screening\nprocedures for the antibodies have been previously\ndescribed (11).  Hybridomas were obtained from the\ncultures of PAI myeloma cells fused with spleen cells\nfrom BALB/c mice immunized with cells infected with\nthe LB red strain of CPV, or Ikeda strain or Lister strain\nof VV.  The obtained ascites fluids as previously\ndescribed (12) were used as MAbs.  The subclasses of\nthese antibodies were determined by immunodiffusion\n\nwith a hybridoma cell lysate and class-specific\nimmunoglobulin antisera as described by Volk et al.\n(27).\n\nImmunofluorescence (IF) test. The direct and indirect\n(IF) test was carried out with cells infected with each\nvirus at 2 to10 PFU (plaque-forming unit)/ml cultured\nfor 24 hr after infection and fixed with cold acetone.\nFor the membrane IF (MIF) test, cells infected and cul-\ntured were used without fixation.  The FITC (fluorescein\nisothiocyanate isomer I, Becton Dicknson & Co.,\nU.S.A.)-conjugation with antibody can be performed\nusing the methods of Kawamura et al.  (10). Briefly, the\nantibody (ascites) was concentrated with a saturated\nsolution of ammonium sulfate and dialyzed with 0.85%\nNaCl buffer (pH 7.0).  The FITC was dissolved with\n500 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5), added to\nproduce a ratio of 10\u201340 \u00b5g/mg of antibody solution,\nand immediately mixed.  The mixture was incubated\nand rotated at room temperature for 2 hr.  The unreacted\nFITC or MAb was removed by gel filtration of\nSephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Sweden)\ncolumn chromatography, and then DEAE (diethyl-\naminoethyl)-cellulose ion exchange chromatography\n(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto).  The F/P (1:2) ratio was\ndetermined by measuring the absorbance at 280 and\n495 nm.  This FITC-labeled MAb was used for direct IF\ntest.\n\nSerological analyses.  For the NT test, about 200\nPFU/ml of virus was incubated for 60 min at 37 C with\nfourfold serial dilutions of MAbs in MEM-CS.  The\nvirus-antibody sample was adsorbed to RK13 or HeLa\ncells for 60 min at 37 C. After 48 to 64 hr of incubation\nat 37 C, plaques were visualized by staining with\n0.13% crystal violet in 2% ethanol.  The titer of the\nantibodies was determined as the reciprocal of the high-\nest fourfold dilution neutralizing 50% of the PFU.  The\nIP assay has been described in detail elsewhere (11).\nThe WB techniques with MAbs by the method of Tow-\nbin et al. (26) with slight modifications have been\ndescribed in detail elsewhere (11).\n\nResults\n\nEstablishment and Characterization of MAbs\nSeven MAbs were obtained from mice immunized\n\nwith the CPV (LB red strain)- or the VV (Ikeda or Lis-\nter strain)-infected cells.  The specificities and the cross-\nreactivities of these antibodies with cells infected with\nvarious strains of CPV, VV, EV and SFV were exam-\nined by IF, IP, WB and several biological and serologi-\ncal analyses.  The antibodies reacting with the known\nmajor antigens, i.e., the common antigen of all\npoxviruses, probably involved the NP and NT antigen.\n\n220 N. KITAMOTO ET AL\n\n\n\nSeven MAbs were characterized and classified into\nthree groups according to their IF, IP and WB analyses.\nResults of the reactivities of the seven MAbs directed\nagainst common antigens are summarized in Table 1\nand are described below in detail.\n\nThree MAbs (C1321, C8911 and V1141) in the\ngroup A reacted with the CPV strains (LB red, Amster-\ndam, 53, 58 and 60), EV strains (Ishibashi and Hamp-\nstead) and VV strains (Ikeda, Lister, IHD-W and IHD-\nJ).  MAbs C1321 and C8911 clones were derived from\nmice immunized with the LB red strain of CPV, and the\nMAb V1141 clone was obtained from mice immunized\nwith the Ikeda strain of VV.  MAbs C1321 and C8911\nwere isotype IgG1, and MAb V1141 was isotype IgG3.\nAll of these MAbs reacted with the strains of CPV, EV\nand VV by the IF test (Table 1), and with granular pat-\nterns at the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1a).  These\nMAbs reacted with the strains of CPV, EV and VV by\nIP and WB (Table 1), and with a polypeptide band of\nmolecular weight 65,000 (65 K) in the infected cells\n(Fig. 2).  These MAbs also reacted with the SFV of the\ngenus Leporipoxviridae (OA strain) in the IF test.\nThese antibodies gave negative reactions in the NT and\nMIF tests, and with MCV-, measles virus (Edmonston\nstrain)-, herpes simplex virus (type 1)- and mock-infect-\ned cells.\n\nOn the other hand, the C4413 clone (group B) reacted\nwith a 40 K polypeptide on IP and with two polypep-\n\ntides of 65 K and 40 K on WB (Fig. 2), and gave a pin\nspot-like cytoplasmic fluorescent staining pattern (Fig.\n1b).  The cross-reactivity of C4413 with each virus and\nwith the 65 K polypeptide was the same as those of\ngroup A. However, the IF staining and polypeptide pat-\nterns of MAb C4413 appeared to be different from\nthese of the clones in group A.\n\nThe C3716, V1771 and VL101 MAbs had neutraliz-\ning activity and each NT titer was 1,024 to 4,096 (Table\n1).  The C3716 clone was established from mice immu-\nnized with the LB red strain of CPV, and the V1141\nand V1771 clones were established from mice immu-\nnized with the Ikeda strain and Lister strain of VV,\nrespectively.  These MAbs reacted with 28 K polypep-\ntides on IP and on WB (Fig. 2).  These antibodies gave\npositive reactions with cells infected with CPV, EV or\nVV, but not with SFV in the IF and WB.  The reaction\nwas positive in the MIF test.  These antibodies gave\nnegative reactions with MCV-, measles virus-, herpes\nsimplex virus (type 1)- and mock-infected cells.  The IF\nstaining by these antibodies was surface and cytoplas-\nmic diffuse (Fig. 1c).\n\nPossibility of Rapid Diagnosis Using MAbs\nThe direct IF test using the FITC-labeled MAbs\n\nshortens the time needed for the procedures.  Two types\nof MAbs, V1141 (anti-NP) and VL101 (anti-NT) were\nchosen for development of the serological detection\n\n221ORTHOPOXVIRUS DIAGNOSIS USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES\n\nTable 1.

The smear of infected\ncells was fixed with cold acetone for 5 min.  The FITC-\nlabeled MAb was dropped on the smear and incubated\nfor 30 min at 37 C. The smear was then washed with\nPBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.0) and mounted\nwith glycerin for fluorescence microscopic examina-\ntion.  This procedure takes only 45 min.  The FITC-\nlabeled V1141 showed granular patterns at the cyto-\nplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1e), and cross-reacted\nwith cells infected with CPV, VV, EV and SFV.  The\nlabeled VL101 showed a surface diffuse pattern at the\ncytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1f), and cross-reacted\nwith cells infected with CPV, VV and EV.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThree MAbs (C1321, C8911 and V1141) in group A\n\nrecognized a common antigen in all the poxviruses\n(probably NP antigen, although this has not been\nabsolutely established), since they both reacted with the\n65 K polypeptide (6, 11) and cross-reacted with all the\npoxvirus-infected cells (29).  We also found that the 65\nK polypeptide was detected by the WB of CPV virions\npurified from infected cells (data not shown).  Wilton et\nal. (28) reported several MAbs against VV which recog-\nnized the core complex components and reacted with\ncytoplasmic inclusions (called B-type inclusions) widely\nranging in size.  The possibility is that the NP proteins\nare highly immunogenic antigens.  The NP antigen is\nassociated with the B-type inclusions, and not with ATI\n(9).  On the other hand, the C4413 clone (group B)\nreacted with a 40 K polypeptide on IP and with two\npolypeptides of 65 K and 40 K on WB.  This was\nexamined by peptide mapping experiments involving\n\n222 N. KITAMOTO ET AL\n\nFig. 1. Characteristic appearance of indirect (a\u2013d) and direct (e, f) immunofluorescence (IF) test after staining of CPV\n(cowpox virus)-infected RK13 cells with each monoclonal antibody (MAb). The cells infected with CPV (LB red\nstrain) were smeared and fixed with cold acetone for 5 min. For indirect IF test (a\u2013d), MAb was added as the first\nantibody and incubated for 1 hr at 37 C. After washing with PBS, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel\nLab., Westchester, Penn., U.S.A.) as the second antibody was reacted for 30 min at 37 C. For the direct IF test (e, f),\nFITC-conjugated MAb was dropped and incubated for 30 min at 37 C. MAbs: (a) C1321, granular fluorescence of\ncytoplasm; (b) C4413, pin spot-like staining in the cytoplasm; (c) C3716, cell surface and diffuse cytoplasmic stain-\ning; (d) ATI, staining of cytoplasmic A-type inclusions as a control; (e) FITC-labeled V1141, granular fluorescence of\ncytoplasm; (f) FITC-labeled VL101, cell surface and diffuse cytoplasmic staining.\n\n\n\nthe partial proteolysis of these 65 K polypeptides by V8\nprotease digestion (1).  The peptide pattern of the 65 K\npolypeptide reacting with C4413 was different from\nthat recognized by clones of group A. The cross-reactiv-\nity of C4413 with each virus and with the 65 K\npolypeptide was the same as those of group A. Howev-\ner, the IF staining and polypeptide patterns of MAb\nC4413 appeared to be different from these of the clones\nin group A.\n\nThe C3716, V1771 and VL101 MAbs had neutraliz-\ning activity.  These MAbs recognizing an envelope pro-\ntein of VV have been reported to show neutralizing\nactivity and to react with the 14 K polypeptide (27) or\nthe 28\u201329 K polypeptide (14, 20).  The C3716 clone\nwas established from mice immunized with the LB red\nstrain of CPV, and the V1141 and V1771 clones were\nestablished from mice immunized with the Ikeda strain\nand Lister strain of VV, respectively.  These antibodies\ncross-reacted with cells infected with each strain of\nCPV and VV.  Therefore, the 28 K polypeptide associ-\nated with neutralization shows a high degree of protein\nconservation in the Orthopoxvirus genus.\n\nThe final aim of this study was to establish a diagno-\nsis of the smallpox infection.  The IF test using MAbs\nwas examined for the detection of the orthopoxviruses.\nAlthough the methods using PCR and EM were already\n\navailable for detecting poxvirus, the IF test using MAbs\nmight be no less specific than PCR and EM.  Also, the\nIF test is simpler, manageable at a lower cost and\napplicable for more samples than the PCR and EM\ndiagnoses.  In the indirect IF test, MAbs will be used as\nthe primary antibodies for the detection of the poxvirus\nantigen in fresh tissue impression smears.  This assay\nrequired only 2\u20133 hr to detect the viral antigen.  The\nELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay),\nimmunochromatography and microarray assays using\nMAbs might also be rapid and capable ways of detect-\ning the virus in tissue samples.  In preliminary study,\nELISA using our MAbs will make it possible to detect\nthe orthopoxviruses.  However, a treated or solubilized\nantigen sample has to be prepared.  In contrast, in the IF\ntest, only fresh tissue impression smears from skin\nlesions will serve this purpose.  In our preliminary\nstudy, we determine that the direct IF test will prove to\nbe sensitive and reliable against infected tissues of labo-\nratory animal.  BALB/c mice were infected intramuscu-\nlarly or intracutaneously with Lister strains of VV.\nThree or 4 days later, tissue impression smear samples\nwere obtained from vesicular or pustular lesions and\nexamined with the direct IF test.  The MAbs NT1 and\nNP1 showed clear positive reactions as well as tissue\nculture infected cells.  It is important to prepare for the\n\n223ORTHOPOXVIRUS DIAGNOSIS USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES\n\nFig. 2.

The results shown are for MAbs, C1321, V1141, C4413, C3716,\nV1771, VL101 and ATI (as a control), and for antigen, LB red strain of CPV (C) and Lister strain of VV (V). Pro-\nteins in the cells were boiled for 2 min, lysed with sample buffer (about 10 to 20 \u00b5g/well) and SDS-PAGE was con-\nducted in 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets which were incu-\nbated overnight at room temperature with the indicated MAbs (at 1:1,000 dilution of ascites), and then incubated with\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Lab.) for 1 hr at 37 C and treated with sub-\nstrate (4-chloro-1-naphthol). Calibration kits were used for the molecular weight determination (M); numbers on the\nleft side indicate the apparent molecular weight (\ufffd1,000). Each MAb reacted with all strains of the genus\nOrthopoxvirus, with the major polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 65 K, 40 K or 28 K.\n\n\n\nrapid diagnosis of smallpox in an emergency.  The\ndirect IF test requires only 45 min to perform and multi-\nple samples can be tested at one time.\n\nRelationships between poxviruses were evaluated by\ncomparing the genome size, number of unique genes,\ngene arrangement and phylogenetic analyses of protein\nsequences (3).  Genus Avipoxvirus is the most diver-\ngent.  The next most divergent is Molluscipoxvirus,\nwhose sole member, MCV, infects only man.  Within\nthe genus Orthopoxvirus, monkeypox virus, EV, CPV\nand VV are closely related to variola virus and are dis-\ntinct from SFV of the genus Leporipoxvirus. Immuno-\nfluorescence staining technique using polyclonal anti-\nbodies has been examined (15, 25).  The results indicat-\ned high sensitivity for the IF test in diagnosing variola\nmajor, but also showed a high rate of false-positive\nresults (25).  Our previous study, hyper immune mouse\nsera to VV showed faint positive reactions with MCV,\nwhich has low homology to orthopoxviruses.  Our\nMAbs did not react in the least with MCV.  These\nresults suggest that MAbs are more specific for\northopoxviruses.\n\nIt has been reported that MAbs reactive against each\nof the five outer layer proteins neutralized infectivity\n(20).  Several neutralization epitopes were also mapped\nto within the short consensus repeat domain (18).  Fur-\nther studies are necessary to define the molecular loca-\ntion of these epitopes recognized with our MAbs, and to\nexamine the reaction to synthetic peptides homologous\nto variola virus.  Although we actually cannot attempt to\ndevelop human samples, it is also necessary to demon-\nstrate that these MAbs react with infected cells with\nmonkeypox virus belonging to the same genus.  It is\nimportant to take measures to deal with the situation\nand to prepare for the diagnosis of smallpox in an emer-\ngency.  The direct IF test using MAbs is a rapid, simple\nand useful routine screening for multiple samples of tis-\nsue impression smears from skin lesions in most labora-\ntories or institutes.  These are the major advantages of\nthe assay developed in this study.  Virus isolation, PCR\nor EM examination could be used as a definite diagnosis\nfor smallpox infection.\n\nWe thank Eriko Goto, Kenzi Hiroi and Satoru Tanimoto,\nmembers of the Department of Microbiology, Wakayama Med-\nical College, for their help with this work.\n\nReferences\n\n1) Cleveland, D.W., Fischer, S.G., Kirschener, M.W., and\nLaemmli, U.K. 1977.

The PI3Kd inhibitor Cal-101 is cytotoxic in B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro and is\n\nactive in the treatment of CLL in vivo. Interestingly, we demonstrated that BKM120 is 3.6 fold more toxic than Cal-101 in\n\nmalignant B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro. BKM120 cytotoxicity correlated with the basal expression of proteins involved in the\n\nPI3K/Akt pathway. A protein signature of PI3K pathway proteins predicts the response to BKM120 treatment. In the primary\n\nB-CLL lymphocytes tested in vitro, BKM120 decreased the phosphorylation status of molecular biomarkers used as indicators\n\nof PI3K pathway inhibition in vivo. Also, BKM120 induced apoptosis in primary B-CLL cells culture in the presence and\n\nabsence of stromal cell support. Our findings suggest that BKM120 should be tested clinically in CLL.\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the\naccumulation of malignant B lymphocytes expressing the sur-\nface antigens CD19, CD20, CD23 and CD5.1 These B-CLL\ncells display altered apoptosis that is caused by both primary\ntumor features and co-dependent stromal elements.2 Current\ntreatments for this disease include chemotherapeutic [alkyl-\nating agents (chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, bendamus-\ntine)], purine analogs (Fludarabine) and immunotherapeutic\nagents (Rituximab, Alemtuzumab) or the combination of\nimmunotherapy with chemotherapeutics drugs [the gold\nstandard for CLL treatment is now fludarabine, cyclophos-\nphamide and rituximab (FCR)]. However, none of these\nstandard treatments result in curative therapy supporting the\n\nneed for the investigation of new therapeutic targets and\ndrug development in CLL as well as markers that can predict\nthe clinical response to these treatments.3\n\nThe B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has been considered\ncritical for B-CLL survival and recent studies demonstrated\nthat inhibition of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), a BCR\nassociated kinase, blocked chemokines signaling leading to\ninhibition of CLL cell migration and survival resulting in\nCLL regression.4,5\n\nThe phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade is also a crit-\nical component of survival signaling including PI3K-activated\nAkt (phosphorylated Akt) which inhibits cell death pathways\nby inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad, procas-\npase-9 and members of the Forkhead transcription factor fam-\nily. Overexpression of PI3K appears to play a critical role in\nB-CLL cell survival. Freshly isolated CLL lymphocytes have\nhigh levels of NF-jB activity and loss of NF-jB and Akt activ-\nity is associated with apoptosis.6\u20138 Cal-101 is a specific inhibi-\ntor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; the\ndelta isoform is expressed primarily in hematopoietic lineages\nand is functionally important in B cells. Preclinical data sug-\ngest that Cal-101 is cytotoxic to CLL in vitro.8 At the 2010\nASH meeting, results were presented of a phase I study of 37\npatients with CLL who were treated with Cal-101.9 Patients\nhad a median of five prior regimens; 65% were refractory to\ntheir most recent prior regimen; 81% had bulky lymphadenop-\nathy; and 36% of the patients had del17. All patients showed\nreduction in lymphadenopathy with 80% achieving a nodal\nresponse. However, concomitant with the decrease in lymph-\nadenopathy there was an increase in lymphocytosis in about\n60% of patients over the first 1\u20132 months of therapy. This\nlymphocytosis appeared to represent a redistribution of lym-\nphocytes from lymph nodes and bone marrow to peripheral\n\nKey words: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, BKM120, PI3K, leukemia\n\ntherapy, CLL apoptosis\n\nAbbreviations: BCR: B-cell receptor; BTK: Bruton tyrosine kinase;\n\nCLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DMEM: Dulbecco\u2019s modified\n\neagle medium; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FCR: fludarabine,\n\ncyclophosphamide and rituximab; MRD: minimal residual disease;\n\nPI: phosphoinositide\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online\n\nversion of this article\n\nGrant sponsor: Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Grant\n\nnumbers: MOP-110991 to Lawrence Panasci and MOP-106528 to\n\nRaquel Aloyz\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.27989\n\nHistory: Received 11 Sep 2012; Accepted 29 Nov 2012; Online 12\n\nDec 2012\n\nCorrespondence to: Lawrence Panasci or Raquel Aloyz, 3755 Cote\n\nSte Catherine Road, H3T 1E2, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Tel.:\n\n\u00fe514-3408248, Fax: \u00fe514-3408302, E-mail: lpanasci@hotmail.com\nor raquel.aloyz@mcgill.ca\n\nSh\nor\nt\nR\nep\nor\nt\n\nInt.

Patients generally experienced significant clinical ben-\nefit from the improvement in lymphadenopathy, with no nega-\ntive consequences from the lymphocytosis. The lymphocytosis\ndid limit the response rate, however, to 26%. Thus, Cal-101 is\nactive in the treatment of refractory CLL. Currently, the pan\nclass I PI3K inhibitor BKM120 developed by Novartis is under\ninvestigation in phase I and II clinical trials in advanced solid\ntumor patients8,10 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n\nMaterial and Methods\nPatients\n\nSixty-five patients with a diagnosis of B-CLL followed at the\nJewish General Hospital of Montreal were enrolled in the\nstudy after informed consent. Patients were either clinically\nuntreated (n \u00bc 36) or treated with chemotherapy (n \u00bc 29)\nfor various time periods (Supporting Information Table 1).\n\nCell lines\n\nThe three B-CLL cell lines JVM2, EHEB and MEC2 (DSMZ,\nBraunschweig, Germany) were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA), complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS). BMS2 stromal cell line were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s\nmodified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS.\n\nCytotoxicity assay\n\nLymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood using\nFicoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) as described.11\n\nThe isolated lymphocyte population was 97.85 6 1.72% ma-\nlignant B-lymphocytes (expressed as a mean % 6 S.D.). The\nCLL lymphocytes (3 \ufffd 106 cells/ml) were treated with vari-\nous concentrations of BKM120 (0.2\u201320 lM) (Novartis\nPharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) or Cal-101 (0.4\u201350 lM) (LC\nLaboratories, Woburn, MA). Control samples were incubated\nwith the greatest volume of DMSO. The MTT assay was per-\nformed 72 h after treatment as previously described12 and\nthe cytotoxic effect of the drug presented as the IC50 (the\ndrug concentration resulting in 50% of control).\n\nWestern blot analysis\n\nCell lysates (50 lg/sample) and protein migration were obtained\nas described before.13 The antibodies utilized were: 4E-BP1, 4E-\nBP1 (Thr37/46), Akt, Akt (Ser473), mTor, p70S6K, p70S6K\n(Thr389), PTEN, raptor and rictor (Cell signalling Technology,\nDanvers, MA) and actin, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa\n\nCruz, CA). The blots were developed using the appropriate\nHRP-secondary antibodies [anti-mouse (GE Healthcare, Piscat-\naway, NJ), anti-rabbit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) or anti-goat\n(Santa Cruz)] and ECL (GE Healthcare). Protein levels were\nquantified by densitometry with Scion image software (Scion\nCorporation, Frederick, MA) and normalized to actin or the total\nprotein expression for the phosphorylated form of the protein.\n\nApoptosis assay\n\nFor this assay, 3 \ufffd 106 cells were treated with the DMSO or\nBKM120 IC50 in the presence or absence of stromal cell for\n24 hr. The induction of apoptosis was determined using the\nAPC AnnexinV/Dead cell apoptosis kit (Invitrogen).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe Pearson Product Moment Correlation and t-testing were\nused for the correlative analysis of predictive biomarkers. The\nprotein expression correlation with BKM120 cytotoxicty with\nthe best p values were utilized to generate Figure 1c. Statisti-\ncal analyses were performed by Friedman Repeated Measures\nAnalysis of Variance on Ranks followed by Bonferroni t-test\nwith SigmaStat software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).\n\nResults and Discussion\nIn view of the critical role of PI3K in CLL homeostasis, the\nactivity of BKM120 was examined in primary B-CLL lym-\nphocytes and in B-CLL cell lines. The in vitro cytotoxic effect\nof BKM120 was assessed in 3 B-CLL cell lines and in pri-\nmary B-lymphocytes isolated from the 65 B-CLL patients en-\nrolled in our study (Supporting Information Table 1) utilizing\nthe MTT assay. The IC50 (drug concentration resulting in\n50% cell death) obtained in the B-CLL cell lines JVM2,\nEHEB and MEC2 were 0.9 6 0.1, 0.7 6 0.1 and 0.7 6 0.1\nlM, respectively. BKM120 was cytotoxic (IC50 below the\nmaximum concentration (20 lM) of BKM120 used in the\nMTT assay) in 78% of the primary B-CLL lymphocytes sam-\nples tested. There are subsets of patients such as those with\n17p (del17) or 11q (del11) deletions, who have a high-risk\nfor poor response to treatment.14 In our study, BKM120 is\ncytotoxic in patients\u2019 samples harboring these deletions (Sup-\nporting Information Tables 1\u20132, Supporting Information Fig.\n1). In the phase I clinical study, the maximum plasma con-\ncentration (Cmax) of BKM120 obtained after administration\nof the maximum tolerated dose of the drug was 5 lM.15\n\nInterestingly, 60% of the B-CLL samples tested in our study\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nNone of the standard treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) result in curative therapy. In view of the critical role\n\nof PI3K in CLL homeostasis, here the authors examine the activity of the pan class I PI3K inhibitor BKM120. They find that\n\nclinically achievable concentrations of BKM120 have antitumor activity in CLL lymphocytes associated with down-regulation of\n\nthe PI3K pathway in vitro. They identify a protein signature predicting BKM120 sensitivity in CLL lymphocytes. Moreover,\n\nBKM120 presents significantly greater cytotoxicity than the PI3Kd inhibitor Cal-101, which is especially relevant since Cal-101\n\nhas known antitumor activity in relapsed CLL patients.\n\nSh\nor\nt\nR\nep\nor\nt\n\n248 PI3K Induced Cell Death in B-CLL Cells\n\nInt.

These results indicated that BKM120 may be useful\nas a single agent in CLL therapy (Fig. 1a, Supporting Infor-\nmation Table 2). Previous studies have shown that the PI3Kd\ninhibitor CAL-101 is cytotoxic in B-CLL lymphocytes in\nvitro.8,16 We therefore compared, by MTT assay, both PI3K\ninhibitors for their potency to induce cell death in 20 pri-\nmary B-CLL cells samples and demonstrated that BKM120 is\n3.6 fold more toxic than CAL-101 in malignant B-CLL lym-\nphocytes in vitro (Fig. 1b, Supporting Information Table 2).\nFurthermore, BKM120 is cytotoxic (IC50 < 20 lM) in 80%\nof these 20 samples tested while CAL-101 is only cytotoxic\n(IC50 < 50 lM) in 45% of these samples. CLL has a widely\n\nvariable response to therapy. Thus, we were interested in\nidentifying molecular features that can predict response to\nBKM120 treatment. We analyzed our samples for somatic\nmutations in the immunoglobulin variable region (IgVH)\ngenes and CD38 expression profiles as well as the basal\nexpression of proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway.\nData Analysis with the Pearson product moment correlation\ntest demonstrated positive correlations between BKM120\ncytotoxicity and the basal expression of Akt (r \u00bc 0.592, p \u00bc\n2.468E-06, n \u00bc 54), rictor (r \u00bc 0.418; p \u00bc 1.65E-03; n \u00bc 54),\nraptor (r \u00bc 0.463; p \u00bc 4.5E-03; n \u00bc 54), p70S6K (r \u00bc 0.584,\np \u00bc 3.561E-06, n \u00bc 54) and 4E-BP1 (r \u00bc 0.371, p \u00bc 5.75E-\n03, n \u00bc 54) but not with PTEN, mTor, IgVH or CD38\nexpression.

J. Cancer: 133, 247\u2013252 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nused the mean expression value for each protein as a cut-off\nand, segregated the samples in two groups, samples with low\nlevel of basal protein expression (below the cut-off) and high\nlevel of basal protein expression (above the cut-off). We then\nsimultaneously examine these different correlative markers\ntogether. We demonstrated that all patients with a BKM120\nIC50 \ufffd 3 lM expressed low level of raptor and p70S6K (Fig.\n1c). Thereby, simultaneous expression of low basal level of\nthese two proteins may be useful to predict response to\nBKM120.\n\nTo determine whether the cytotoxic effect observed in our\nstudy was related to BKM120-induced PI3K inhibition, we\ninvestigated the phosphorylation status of Akt, a direct down-\nstream target of PI3K in the three cell lines. In all cell lines,\nincluding the p53 mutated cell line MEC2, BKM120 inhibits\nAkt phosphorylation (Akt S473) 24 hr after treatment\n(Fig. 1d). In vitro studies have identified that stromal cells\npromoted cell survival and drug resistance of B-CLL lympho-\ncytes by cell\u2013cell interaction and secretion of chemokines.17\n\nFurthermore, bone marrow microenvironment modulates the\nPI3K/Akt pathway and prevents apoptosis of primary CLL\nlymphocytes.18 To determine whether stromal cells can pro-\ntect B-CLL against BKM120 activity, six primary B-CLL sam-\nples were tested for AnnexinV/7-AAD staining 24 hr after\nBKM120 treatment in the presence or absence of the murine\nstromal cells BMS2. In the absence of BMS2 stromal cell sup-\nport, BKM120 induced apoptosis in the six primary B-CLL\nlymphocytes samples tested (mean AnnexinV positive cells:\nDMSO \u00bc 17.2 6 3.7% vs. BKM \u00bc 33.2 6 5.5%; p < 0.001).\nAs previously described17 the stromal cells protected B-CLL\nlymphocytes from apoptosis (DMSO \u00bc 17.2 6 3.7% vs.\nBMS2 \u00fe DMSO \u00bc 5.6 6 1.1%; p \u00bc 0.004) but were not able\nto protect these malignant lymphocytes against BKM120\n(BMS2 \u00fe DMSO \u00bc 5.6 6 1.1% vs. BMS2 \u00fe BKM120 \u00bc 23.6\n6 5.8%; p \u00bc 0.005) (Figs. 2a and 2b). The same results were\nobtained when we assessed the cleavage of caspase-3 (Sup-\nporting Information Fig. 2). There is increasing evidence that\nthe major cause of resistance to therapy in CLL patients is a\nconsequence of a small number of leukemic cells that remain.\nThis phenomenon, called minimal residual disease (MRD), is\nin part a consequence of protection conferred by the stromal\nmicroenvironment to the malignant lymphocytes and eradi-\n\ncation of MRD by alemtuzumab treatment improved overall\nand treatment-free survival in CLL patients.17,19 Interestingly,\nour results demonstrated that the stromal cell microenviron-\nment can not protect B-CLL lymphocytes from apoptosis\ninduced by BKM120 treatment.\n\nMolecular biomarkers such as p70S6K and 4E-BP1 have\nbeen used as indicators of PI3K pathway inhibition in vivo\nand BKM120 inhibits p70S6K phosphorylation in rat fibro-\nblast cell lines in vitro.20,21 We demonstrated that the\nBKM120 IC50s correlated with basal p70S6K and 4E-BP1\nprotein expression in primary B-CLL lymphocytes. We then\nassessed in vitro the phosphorylation status of these two pro-\nteins used as biomarkers in vivo, in 8 (p70S6K T389) and 11\n(4E-BP1 T37/46) primary B-CLL samples after treatment\nwith BKM120. Results demonstrated that after 24 hr treat-\nment, BKM120 decreased the phosphorylation status of 4E-\nBP1 (Figs. 2c and 2d) and p70S6K (Figs. 2e and 2f).\n\nAlthough many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis,\nCLL is a progressive disease and patients eventually require\ntreatment. The main problems during the treatment of\npatients living with CLL are the side effects of therapies and\nthe resistance developed by malignant cells after these treat-\nments. Thereby, no current standard treatment option\nresults in curative therapy, and all patients eventually die.\nTaken together, our results demonstrated that the class I\nPI3K inhibitor BKM120 may be useful as a single agent in\nCLL patients independently of their IgVh mutational status,\nCD38 expression or genomic deletions (del11 and del17).\nFurthermore, a combination of different biomarkers\n(expression of raptor and p70S6K) may predict the response\nto BKM120 treatment. Also, BKM120 abolished the protec-\ntion against apoptosis and drug resistance conferred by the\nmicroenvironment to the primary B-CLL lymphocytes in\nvitro. Our preclinical study demonstrated that BKM120, a\nmolecule with acceptable clinical toxicity,15 may be useful in\nthe treatment of CLL.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors thank the Manitoba CLL tissue bank for the IgVH mutation\nanalysis, Novartis for providing BKM120 and Dr Koren Mann for sharing\nthe BMS2 cells.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Piliated hemolytic Moraxella bovis is recognized as the etiologic agent of IBK.\nAccording to data from the Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, however, Moraxella (Branha-\nmella) ovis has been isolated with increasing frequency from cattle affected with IBK. The objective of this study\nwas, therefore, to examine M. ovis field isolates for the presence of the putative virulence factors of M. bovis.\nCulture filtrates from selected M. ovis field isolates demonstrated hemolytic activity on bovine erythrocytes and\ncytotoxic activity on bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells and corneal epithelial cells. The hemolytic\nactivity of the culture filtrates was attenuated after heat treatment. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the M.\nbovis hemolysin-cytotoxin also recognized a protein of approximately 98 kDa in a Western blot assay. These\ndata indicate that the M. ovis field isolates examined produce one or more heat-labile exotoxins and may\nsuggest that M. ovis plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBK.\n\nInfectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) is a highly con-\ntagious disease that affects cattle of all ages and that occurs\nworldwide (27, 28, 31). The adverse economic impact of IBK\ndue to decreased weight gain and costs of therapeutic treat-\nment is estimated to be $150 million annually (27). Piliated\nhemolytic strains of Moraxella bovis are recognized as the eti-\nologic agents of IBK (5, 10, 11, 23, 35, 36, 37). Moraxella bovis,\nhowever, cannot always be recovered from clinical cases; and\nother organisms, such as Moraxella (Branhamella) ovis, Myco-\nplasma bovoculi, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, and\nadenovirus, have been suggested to play a role in the patho-\ngenesis of IBK (17, 19, 31, 37).\n\nAccording to data of the University of Nebraska Veterinary\nDiagnostic Laboratory System, M. ovis is isolated with increas-\ning frequency from cases of IBK. From 1999 to 2002, M. ovis\nwas isolated three times more often from field cases than M.\nbovis. Isolation of M. ovis from cases of keratoconjunctivitis has\npreviously been reported in sheep, goats, deer, and moose (3,\n14, 16, 17, 30, 33, 40, 41). In cattle, M. ovis has been isolated\nfrom IBK cases (17, 31); but the significance of its isolation is\ncurrently unclear because, in one study, experimental inocula-\ntion of calves with M. ovis isolated did not cause keratocon-\njunctivitis (17). These findings suggest that M. ovis is not a\npathogen or that additional factors may be required for viru-\nlence (9, 17, 32, 43).\n\nIsolates of M. ovis recovered from cattle with IBK have not\nbeen examined for potential virulence factors (6, 21, 26, 34,\n\n39). In an attempt to elucidate whether M. ovis plays a role in\nthe etiology and pathogenesis of IBK, the objective of this\nstudy was to investigate M. ovis field isolates for the presence\nof factors known to be virulence factors in M. bovis by exam-\nining the effects of M. ovis culture filtrates on different types of\ncells of bovine origin.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial isolates. Moraxella ovis isolates recovered from cattle with IBK were\npassed twice on Trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep blood (blood agar;\nRemel, Lenexa, KS) and were stored at \ufffd80\u00b0C in 15% glycerol. A known virulent\nisolate of M. bovis, designated Epp63 (20, 35, 36), and a reference isolate of M.\novis (ATCC 19575) recovered from a sheep with conjunctivitis were used in each\nassay for comparison. Field isolates of M. ovis were identified by phenotypic and\nbiochemical criteria. Briefly, M. ovis colonies were 1 to 3 mm in diameter after\n24 h of incubation, firm, and hemolytic on blood agar; and they tended to slide\nacross the agar surface when they were touched with a Nichrome wire loop.\nMicroscopically, the M. ovis isolates were gram-negative cocci (0.6 to 1.0 \ufffdm)\narranged in pairs. All M. ovis isolates were aerobic and oxidase and catalase\npositive, and they reduced nitrate but did not ferment carbohydrates or liquefy\ngelatin (8, 13, 22, 30).\n\nPreparation of culture supernatants. Aliquots of each isolate from frozen\nstock cultures were streaked onto blood agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.\nCulture for hemolysin production during early-logarithmic-phase growth was\nperformed as described previously (20) but with modification. Briefly, three\ncolonies of each isolate from the blood agar plate were transferred into 3 ml of\nbrain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Remel) supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2/ml\n(Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO), and the cultures were incubated for\n18 h at 37\u00b0C. The cultures were then transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks containing\n50 ml of BHI broth supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2/ml and were incubated with\nshaking (200 rpm) for 4.5 h at 37\u00b0C. The bacterial cells were removed by\ncentrifugation (12,000 \ufffd g) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the culture supernatants were\ntransferred to sterile centrifuge tubes. Each supernatant was filtered through a\n0.22-\ufffdl polysulfone syringe filter (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI), and\nthe cell-free supernatants (CFSs) were either used immediately or frozen at\n\ufffd80\u00b0C until use. An aliquot of each CFS was plated on blood agar to verify\nsterility.\n\nHemolytic activity assay.

The\nhemolytic activity of each CFS was analyzed in 96-well microtiter plates as\ndescribed previously (20) but with modification. Briefly, twofold dilutions (1:2 to\n1:2,048) of each sample were run in duplicate in 100 \ufffdl of a 0.15 M sodium\nchloride (Sigma) solution containing 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer (Sigma) and 10 mM\nCaCl2 (Sigma) buffer (NTC buffer). Wells with distilled water served as positive\ncontrol wells, and wells with NTC buffer served as negative control wells. One\nhundred microliters of 2% washed bovine erythrocytes in PBS was added to each\nwell, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Intact erythrocytes were\npelleted by centrifugation (1,500 \ufffd g) for 5 min, and 100 \ufffdl of each supernatant\nwas then transferred to a new plate. The absorbance (optical density [OD] at 410\nnm) was determined for each well by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). The mean ab-\nsorbance was calculated for each set of wells, and the titers were determined by\nusing the reciprocals of the last dilution with absorbance values above 5% of the\nmean of the positive control wells.\n\nTo determine whether the hemolytic activity of M. ovis CFS was heat labile, 1\nml of each CFS was incubated in a water bath for 30 min at 56\u00b0C and was then\nallowed to cool to room temperature. The hemolytic activity of each CFS was\nthen analyzed in 96-well microtiter plates as described above. In addition, each\nCFS was stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 h and the hemolytic activity was determined as\ndescribed above.\n\nPreparation of bovine PBMCs. Bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) were prepared as described previously (20). Briefly, freshly collected\nblood in EDTA was centrifuged (700 \ufffd g) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The buffy coats were\nremoved and diluted with PBS, and the mixture was layered onto Ficoll-Paque\n(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and then centrifuged (700 \ufffd g)\nfor 40 min at 4\u00b0C. The PBMCs were then collected from the interface, washed three\ntimes in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, and counted in a hemocytometer.\n\nCytotoxic activity assay. The density of the PBMCs was adjusted to a concen-\ntration of 5 \ufffd 106 cells/ml for the dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide\n(MTT) reduction cytotoxicity assay, and the cytoxic activity of each CFS was\ndetermined in 96-well microtiter plates as described previously (20). Briefly,\ntwofold serial dilutions of each sample were run in duplicate in 100 \ufffdl of 1\ufffd\nRPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal\ncalf serum. One hundred microliters of the PBMC suspension was added to each\nwell, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, the\nplates were centrifuged (700 \ufffd g) for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded.\nOne hundred microliters of clear 1\ufffd RPMI 1640 medium and 20 \ufffdl of MTT\n(Sigma) dye solution (5 mg MTT in 1 ml distilled H2O) were then added to each\nwell, and plates were again incubated until a colored reaction product was visible\n(2 to 4 h). The plates were then centrifuged (700 \ufffd g) for 5 min, the supernatant\nwas discarded, and 100 \ufffdl of acid isopropanol was added to each well. Gentle\nagitation was used to dissolve the formazan precipitate. The absorbance of each\nwell was determined on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader by using\na test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The percent\ncytotoxicity for each well was determined as follows: [1 \ufffd (OD of toxin-treated\nmononuclear cells/OD of untreated PBMCs)] \ufffd 100. The untreated PBMCs\nwere used as cell viability controls.\n\nThe cytotoxic activity titer in each well was determined by using the reciprocal\nof the highest dilution that caused the cytolysis of 50% or more of the target cells\n\ncompared to the level of cytolysis of the cells control wells. One hundred micro-\nliters of the PBMC suspension and 100 \ufffdl of RPMI 1640 medium were used to\nassess cell viability, and 100 \ufffdl of medium and 100 \ufffdl of undiluted CFS were used\nto assess nonspecific dye reduction.\n\nCorneal epithelial cell culture. Corneas were collected from three clinically\nhealthy calves immediately following euthanasia. After removal of the globes and\nthe attached conjunctival sacs, the ocular tissues were briefly rinsed with 70%\nethyl alcohol and were then rinsed twice with sterile 0.85% saline solution. A\nsterile scalpel blade was used to remove the cornea at the limbus, and the corneal\nepithelium was dissected away from the underlying stroma. The corneal epithe-\nlium was then rinsed three times in sterile 1\ufffd RPMI 1640 medium containing\n0.003% gentamicin sulfate (Sigma). The corneal epithelium was minced with a\nsterile scalpel blade in a sterile glass petri dish and then transferred to culture\nflasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum\nand 0.003% gentamicin sulfate (c-RPMI). The flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C in\n7% CO2 for 72 h. After incubation, the medium was decanted and the flasks were\nwashed once with warm (37\u00b0C) sterile PBS. Fresh c-RPMI medium was then\nadded to each flask, and the flasks were again incubated at 37\u00b0C in 7% CO2.\nFresh c-RPMI medium was added to each flask at 72-h intervals or until 100%\nconfluent cell monolayers had formed. The confluent cells were detached with\n2.5% trypsin (Sigma), resuspended in c-RPMI, transferred to 96-well culture\nplates, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 7% CO2 for approximately 72 h or until 90%\nconfluent cell monolayers had formed in the wells.\n\nCorneal epithelial cell cytotoxicity assay. Medium from each corneal epithelial\ncell monolayer plate was discarded, and 10 \ufffdl of fresh c-RPMI medium was\nadded to each well. Fifty microliters of a CFS was then added to each well, while\n50 \ufffdl of BHI broth was added to each control well. The plates were incubated at\n37\u00b0C in 7% CO2 for 2 h. Medium from each plate was then discarded, and 200\n\ufffdl of fresh clear c-RPMI medium was added to each well. Each plate was then\nexamined at \ufffd400 magnification with an inverted microscope. The assay was\nperformed three times in duplicate.\n\nWestern blot analyses of M. bovis Epp63 and M. ovis CFS. CFS proteins from\ntwo M. ovis field isolates, M. ovis ATCC 19575, and M. bovis Epp63 were\nseparated by standard 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-\nphoresis (SDS-PAGE), as described previously (38), and then transferred to a\nnitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). A kaleidoscope\nprestained standard (Bio-Rad) was used to assess transfer efficiency. The non-\nspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 1% fish gelatin\n(Sigma) and 0.5% skim milk (Carnation) in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. The primary\nantibody, a polyclonal rabbit serum raised against a partially purified extract of\nhemolytic M. bovis strain T\ufffd (2) (kindly provided by L. George, University of\nCalifornia\u2014Davis), was used at a 1:250 dilution in PBS. After 1 h of incubation\nin primary antibody at ambient temperature, the membrane was washed (PBS\ncontaining 500 \ufffdl/liter Tween 20 [Bio-Rad]) and then incubated for 1 h in a\n1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-\nlabeled conjugate (Promega, Madison, WI). Detection of bound secondary an-\ntibody was by chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and autoradiography.\nNormal rabbit serum was substituted for anti-M. bovis antibodies as a negative\ncontrol in the protocol.\n\nFIG. 1.

The\nCFSs from all isolates demonstrated hemolytic activities in the\nassay, with titers ranging from 256 to 2,048 for the five M. ovis\nfield isolates and from 4,096 to 8,192 for the M. bovis Epp63\nisolate (Fig. 1A). Heat treatment of the CFSs before the he-\nmolysin assay was conducted attenuated the hemolytic activity,\nas the titers of the M. ovis CFSs observed after heat treatment\nranged only from 2 to 4 (Fig. 1B). This effect was also evident\nwhen heat-treated and non-heat-treated CFSs were run side by\nside for direct comparison (Fig. 2). In this series of assays,\nnon-heat-treated M. ovis CFSs had hemolytic activity titers of\n1,024 to 2,048 that were reduced to titers of 2 to 4 after heat\ntreatment. Non-heat-treated M. bovis CFS titers were 4,096 to\n8,192, and the titers after heat treatment were 8 to 32. When\nthe CFSs were stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 h prior to the assay,\nhemolytic activity was reduced by three- to fourfold dilutions in\nthe M. ovis CFSs (titer range, 32 to 256) and one- to three fold\ndilutions in the M. bovis Epp63 CFSs (titer range, 1,024 to\n2,048) (data not shown). Because of the consistent hemolytic\nactivities of their CFSs, field isolates 3 and 5 were selected for\nuse in the cytotoxicity assays and in Western blot analyses.\n\nCytotoxic activities of CFSs on bovine PBMCs. The CFSs of\nM. ovis field isolates 3 and 5, M. ovis ATCC 19575, and M. bovis\nEpp63 demonstrated cytotoxic activities on bovine PBMCs,\nwith geometric mean titers ranging from 64 to 16 (data not\nshown).\n\nEffects of CFSs on bovine corneal epithelial cells. Exposure\nof corneal cell monolayers to CFSs from M. ovis field isolates\n3 and 5 and M. bovis Epp63 resulted in cell detachment and\ncomplete loss of the cell monolayers within 2 h. The CFS from\nM. ovis ATCC 19575, however, did not cause any noticeable\nmonolayer disruption or the loss of cells (Fig. 3).\n\nSDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of CFSs. The poly-\nclonal primary antibody recognizes a cluster of repeats in toxin\n(RTX) A proteins of M. bovis strain T\ufffd (2). These antibodies\n\nalso recognized several proteins in the M. bovis Epp63 CFS\n(Fig. 4, lane M. bovis Epp63). A cluster of strong bands mi-\ngrated at about 90 to 100 kDa, and another cluster migrated at\nabout 80 to 88 kDa. Several proteins were also detected in the\nM. ovis CFS (Fig. 4). The distribution of bands in all M. ovis\nlanes, however, was such that the more prominent bands mi-\ngrated at lower molecular masses. A single band of about 98\nkDa recognized in the M. bovis CFS was also recognized in all\nM. ovis CFSs. When preimmunization rabbit serum was used\nas the primary antibody, no bands were seen (data not shown),\nindicating that the bands detected by the anti-M. bovis serum\nare due to a specific antigen-antibody reaction and are not due\nto nonspecific binding of the antibody.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results of this study indicate that M. ovis isolates recov-\nered from cattle with IBK produce one or more heat-labile\nexotoxins that demonstrate hemolytic activity on bovine eryth-\nrocytes and cytotoxic activity on bovine PBMCs and corneal\nepithelial cells. The data indicate that, like the known virulent\nisolate M. bovis Epp63 (12, 20, 21, 25, 27), the M. ovis isolates\ntested also possess hemolytic and cytotoxic activities. The he-\nmolytic and cytotoxic activities of M. bovis are mediated by a\nhemolysin, a calcium-dependent, pore-forming RTX (2, 5, 7,\n12, 20). Although the definite nature of the toxic activities of\n\nFIG. 2. Comparison of hemolytic activities of M. bovis and M. ovis\nfield isolates after heat treatment.

Bars indicate the geometric mean titers of the hemolytic activities\nof the CFSs from M. bovis Epp63 and two of the five M. ovis field\nisolates (isolates 3 and 5), as in Fig. 1. Error bars represent the 95%\nconfidence intervals of the means. The results shown represent data\nfrom three independent replications.\n\nFIG. 3. Effects of CFSs on bovine corneal epithelial cell monolay-\ners. Monolayers of corneal epithelial cells were either not exposed to\nany CFS (negative control) (A) or exposed to M. ovis ATCC 19575\nCFS (B), exposed to M. ovis field isolates 3 (C) or 5 (D), or exposed to\nM. bovis Epp63 CFS (positive control) (E). Note the complete disrup-\ntion of the monolayers exposed to CFSs produced by field isolates 3\nand 5 and M. bovis Epp63.

Substantial\nattenuation of the hemolytic activity of the M. ovis CFS after\nheat treatment also suggests that the presumptive M. ovis exo-\ntoxin is proteinaceous, like the M. bovis RTX. Based on the\nobservation that the titers of the M. bovis CFSs were slightly\nhigher in this assay, it may be speculated that the M. ovis\nexotoxin is more readily inactivated. A similar tendency was\nevident when CFSs were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 24 h before the\nhemolysin assay was conducted. This difference could be due to\nstructural or conformational differences in the proteins or to\nthe activity of proteolytic enzymes released by M. ovis during\nlogarithmic growth (4, 18). The objective of this study, how-\never, was to examine selected M. ovis field isolates for the\npresence of potential virulence factors, and no attempt was\nmade to quantify the hemolytic or the cytotoxic activity.\n\nThe primary antibody used in the Western blot assay spe-\ncifically recognized the M. bovis toxin, but it also recognized\nseveral proteins in the M. ovis CFSs. A cluster of bands of\napproximately 95 to 100 kDa may be significant because this\nmolecular mass is consistent with those of recognized RTXs\n(18, 42), including M. bovis RTX A (1, 2). A single band in all\nM. ovis CFSs migrated at this particular molecular mass, sug-\ngesting some structural similarity. The identities of the several\nlower-molecular-mass bands present in the M. ovis lanes are\nunknown at this time. Other investigators have shown that\nfull-length RTXs degrade after only a few hours in culture, and\nspecific antibodies recognize several smaller degradation prod-\nucts (2, 18). If it is assumed that a toxin is present in the M. ovis\nCFS, it is possible that those lower-molecular-mass bands rep-\nresent the degradation products of a full-length toxin.\n\nThe M. ovis isolates examined in this study differed in their\nhemolytic and cytotoxic activities. This may suggest that the\nisolates are different strains, but no testing was done to deter-\nmine if these isolates were indeed different strains. The num-\nber of animal passages of each of the M. ovis field isolates\nreceived prior to laboratory isolation is unknown, and the\nnumber of animal and laboratory passages of M. ovis ATCC\n19575 is also unknown. Interestingly, M. ovis ATCC 19575 did\nnot exhibit any cytotoxicity to bovine corneal epithelial cells,\nalthough toxicity to erythrocytes and peripheral blood mono-\nnuclear cells was observed. Intraspecies variation (e.g., strain\ndifferences), as suggested above, does not likely account for\nthese results. It has been shown for M. bovis that only piliated\nisolates can adhere to bovine corneal epithelial cells (24, 29);\nand it is possible, therefore, that isolate ATCC 19575 was not\npiliated and could not adhere to the corneal cells to exert a\ntoxic effect. Some RTXs have been shown to specifically rec-\nognize and bind to a host cell receptor (15, 41), and it is also\npossible that the presumptive hemolysin of the ATCC 19575\nstrain lacked this ability. It is also noteworthy that the ATCC\n19575 isolate is of sheep origin, and a toxin produced during\npassages in sheep may act on the cornea in a strictly species-\nspecific manner but may act more promiscuously on erythro-\ncytes and PBMCs. The M. ovis isolates were not examined for\npiliation, and the reasons for differences in activity between the\ntwo M. ovis field isolates and the ATCC 19575 isolate remain\nspeculative.\n\nCurrently, piliated and hemolytic M. bovis isolates are\nrecognized as the etiologic agents of IBK. Data from the\nNebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, how-\never, indicate that M. ovis is isolated from the majority of\ncattle with IBK. From January 1999 through December\n2002, samples from a total of 109 cases of IBK were received\nat the Veterinary Diagnostic Center. In 79 cases (72.5%), M.\novis was the only agent isolated, whereas in 18 cases\n(16.5%), M. bovis was the only pathogen isolated. In 12\ncases (11%), both M. ovis and M. bovis isolates were recov-\nered. Other investigators have isolated M. ovis from cattle\nwith IBK (17, 31), but experimental inoculation of calves\nwith M. ovis isolates did not cause keratoconjunctivitis in\none study (17). Although the M. ovis isolates in another\nstudy exhibited hemolytic activity on blood agar (31), they\nwere not examined for cytotoxic activity or piliation. These\nfindings might suggest that M. ovis, if it is pathogenic, may\nrequire initial corneal damage or other predisposing factors\nto cause disease in cattle. Moraxella bovis isolates differ in\ntheir virulence; some isolates readily cause disease experi-\nmentally, while others require corneal damage to cause dis-\nease (11, 19, 34). Differences in virulence may also be a\ncommon to M. ovis isolates. Since only piliated, hemolytic\nisolates of M. bovis are pathogenic for cattle (35), pili may\nalso be necessary for M. ovis to attach to and colonize bovine\ncornea and conjunctiva. This hypothesis should be further\naddressed by using M. ovis field isolates from cattle. Al-\nthough the results of this study indicate that M. ovis field\nisolates from cattle produce one or more exotoxins, further\ncharacterization of this suspected M. ovis toxin and studies\nthat examine the piliation of field isolates and adherence of\nM. ovis to the bovine cornea are necessary to substantiate\nthe potential role of M. ovis in the pathogenesis of IBK.\n\nFIG. 4.
