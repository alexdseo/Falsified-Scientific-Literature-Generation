Another in a series of recent reports reporting hundreds of thousands of “false-positive” SARS-CoV Nano-Takedon Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Due to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E Rectified by Western Blotting with Recombinant SARS-CoV Spike Polypeptide

SARS-CoV was once believed to be the most common outbreak in the entire country. Since the discovery in 1975 of an earlier SARS case in China, it has spread rapidly throughout the USA and Western Canada with at least 3,200 reports of SARS and 704 confirmed deaths in 1988 and 1990. Even today SARS-CoV NCTN is listed in SARS’s Companion Disease, and only affects some 100,000 individuals worldwide.

The latest study (1998, 98) documented 5,000 people contracting SARS-CoV with samples tested during 1988 and 1990. Recombinant SARS is a debilitating and frequently fatal disease known as “Cervical respiratory syndrome.”

“In the last decade, the majority of infections with SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Due to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E Rectified by Western Blotting with Recombinant SARS-CoV Spike Polypeptide has been isolated,” said Professor W. Lee Harvey, team member at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in San Diego.

“We know very little about the causes of such a virulent vaccine program, or why the vaccine expired in 2002, and how this vaccine has yet to prove successful in traditional vaccine testing.”

According to W. Lee Harvey, the latest reported data raise the overall level of concern among the US vaccine manufacturers and our country’s vaccine safety programs. Specifically, both pre and post-public safety investigators warn the millions of Americans infected with SARS who would otherwise have been able to achieve a cure. They advise preventive measures which we are already taking.
