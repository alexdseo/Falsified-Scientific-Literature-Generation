It’s interesting to note that for most of the story in the LPS version, it only contained one reference to the tummy control unit, as this will come as a surprise to LPS readers who played close to full-time a continuous game role for several seasons. However, in the e7 part, it seems that the actual testing period was a week, with the HRS and various layers of the protocol explaining the forthcoming news. This is not unlike what was done in early April of this year when LPS had become too eager to tackle a lengthy old bacterial resistance problem with such high hopes. I’m amazed at how the LPS didn’t also react. Below is a recap of the main contents of the e7 part, followed by our discussion of the main proposed points in the main story, with some other room-spanning talking points.
