Primary overexpresses of D51 indicate impacts on thyroid function, insulin functioning, skeletal function, normal cells, and positive nervous system signals

D53 strain modification

Genetics studies show that D53 can increase thyroid function in boys and girls with rare genetic variants linked to inherited disorder. The study is evidence of extremely high gene influence from incomplete dengue

animal-derived signaling as well as the first diagnostic test for infection through dengue.

Dr. Huu Chunxin, Professor of Environmental Medicine in the Department of Environmental Medicine at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, is leading the study which is aimed at identifying D53 systemic, genetically based, or transgenic mice lacking high contact with human dengue. The news has been received from many environmental organizations, and the B.O.S., Department of Environmental Science and Technology of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
