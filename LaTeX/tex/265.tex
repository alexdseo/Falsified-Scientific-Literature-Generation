A discovery by German researchers in test mice that greatly increased the size of the receptors in the stomach that helps to digest milk, milk and vegetables has significance, says Werner Von Dreyer, an associate professor of internal medicine at the Infection Control Center of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Insects exert receptors for proteins, and many animals use them in transplants.

The researchers studied embryonic mice injected with giant ligament-cutting antibodies that mimicked cells inside the body.

Compared with the single-cell animals, for instance, offspring of an adult adolescent received 30 percent larger quantities of anantigenic lipopolysaccharide. The slight increase in antigen balance gives the researchers an additional advantage in the development of trials for lipopolymers, scientists said.

The researchers also report that lipid proteins can be used to guide the immune system to find and attack cancer cells.

Researchers concluded that hormone receptor modification may reduce the palpitations in macrophages that cause breast cancers by 70 percent in males with and without the right auto-immune proteins.
