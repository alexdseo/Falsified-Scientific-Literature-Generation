EDWARDSVILLE, Conn.

today announced that it is launching an effective registration system and new EntpStat Test-type biological and electronic instrument designs to assist in selecting scientific advisors to receive an Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) grant for the development of supplemental protection/development and robustance technologies in advanced toxicology applications.

Existing Avian Pathogens Certificates (ACS) provides the flexibility and cost certainty needed to develop therapeutic programs for certain cancer treatments, biopharmaceutical programs and dose loads. The new system is designed to provide more standardized registration for the manufacture and development of integrated practices and electronic instrument design for the Precision Metabolic Phase III clinical trials, as well as select principal investigator recruiting, market presence and pathogenesis of certain cancers.

The ACS® license foundation is the ultimate objective of Avian Pathogens Certification, Inc.

Avian Pathogens Certification accredits up to 8 accredited Avian Pathogens Cell Embovillations and Lab and DexCas equipment, and includes chemical, immunocompromised, electrochemistry, dosing and medical instruments and assistive devices. The ACS® license foundation also maintains the Avian Pathogens X Link, a World Health Organization (WHO) preapproval research system for augmenting a biological or other environmental filtering system to support exclusive selection mechanisms.
