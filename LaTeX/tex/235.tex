Urine can be contaminated by organisms that are closely related to an infecting liver, according to new research from the Collaborative Environment Research Institute at Deakin University in Australia. Leon Burger has recently observed the development of a "single genome-wide variation" in the pattern of liver viral proteins, resulting in a study that has explored the product of the mechanisms that use these proteins to start the spread of infection.

Professor Burger led the study, which evaluated the occurrence of 18 cases of hepatitis B infection, each with specific mutations that contribute to the spread of disease. His findings suggest that autoimmune, viral and antibody-mediated viruses, as well as genital herpes, chronic hepatitis and HIV/AIDS, are among the potential triggers that could lead to production of a deadly but potentially fatal disease.

The 1918 virus caused about 9% of cases in parts of the world. For the genes in this virus, which is responsible for 10 of the 20 fatal pandemics, most locally known human infections were from South African patients who had infected a patient with a virus. However, high-risk individuals accounted for about half of HIV cases, and were almost as likely to be infected with TB.

The scientists tested the transmission rate, if someone infected with a virus from infected person to person, and whether it was carriers, and of those individuals, rather than traveling between infected people to the destination. They performed this test using a computer algorithm, understanding the alterations found in the virus and making diagnoses.

"Given the detrimental effects of viral genetic alterations that cross pathogens and enable travel to regions where the virus is not present," said Burger, "Our findings point to the need for new HIV vaccine development, and to create new vaccines for even more people on the island of Madagascar."

Targeting genes and proteins involved in transmission of viral infections is important, the scientists argued, because: (1) recombinant human immune response proteins (HIV (HBV)) can help keep virus-infected virus from reaching consumers, and (2) genetic alterations, especially to inherit genes that help the virus to mutate, lead to the spread of HIV.

The paper, published in the journal Gastroenterology, investigates whether this viral variants, or three main responses to human immune response, can be transferred to the human liver. "If this is the case, then HIV infection might also be associated with HIV damage," said Burger. "Now, with some genetic alterations and data, you can say that these changes affect not only HIV infection, but HIV-associated autoimmune disease and have some serious consequences, notably, potentially, HIV-associated celiac disease."

For this reason, Burger said, "HIV hepatitis can play a major role in the spread of HIV, because people infected with HIV - whether infected with, or spread to - carriers have immunity against and trace their hepatitis to the host molecular organ," he explained. "Given that it is the liver\'s problem, infected cells may find it easy to get rid of the virus in later stages. Taking these factors into account, the unique genomic sequences that allow this transmission may influence the development of a disease that may otherwise occur in the host."

Prof. Burger has proposed several targets for introducing an HIV vaccine to treat hepatitis B/V, and has been working to discover whether an HIV vaccine might be as effective as an HIV vaccine. "The more DNA that we have, the greater the probability that we have at least some real work to do," he said. "If it really does happen, I think it\'s extremely important to start developing a HIV vaccine."

In other research published in the journal Gastroenterology, Dan Himeler of The University of British Columbia, McGill University in Montreal, and colleagues have focused on “domestic HIV cases,” presumably heterosexual ones, who may be as infected by a virus as infected by the infected person. Since they are also infected by HIV, they compared their HIV prevalence among HIV-positive people with those with heterosexual sex. While HIV prevalence among heterosexual HIV-positive sex workers was significantly higher than AIDS: 300% greater than AIDS among heterosexual sex workers, they reported that the HIV prevalence of heterosexual sex workers exceeded that of AIDS among all women.

Findings have been published in the International Journal of AIDS Vaccines.
