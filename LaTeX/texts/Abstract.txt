'In spite of massive efforts from the geotechnical and radiological sciences, which have replaced geological, biological and molecular investigations in this area, African soilâ€™s unique milieu has not given out the secrets of the unique and niche nature of African soil. And these insights that have been passed on by the natural sciences still to be shaped by the fundamental knowledge that people have acquired from their neighbors.\nIn spite of this new information, having lived under many different environments in this region, and had scientists studying the soil, my own perspective has not changed from that of somebody who has been living in this region for a very long time. And the impacts of these changes have not affected my scientific and medical life.\nAnd I would also like to add that I now feel something different than I did when I was growing up, and I have also been interacting with researchers to understand the new information and their viewpoints.'
