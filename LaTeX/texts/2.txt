'BONUS PARTICIPATION: Researchers are currently conducting laboratory experiments to determine if STIM1 can inhibit its tumor metastasis and improve the quality of life of cancer patients. Results are expected within 18 months.\nBONUS PARTICIPATION: Researchers at the University of Missouri are making progress in understanding the molecular mechanism that enables two important cancer molecules, STIM1 and CR845, to become tumor cells. As part of this ongoing research, researchers will examine whether STIM1 can be genetically altered by activating an endocrine pathway that is involved in physical regulation of the hormone mTOR.\nSTIM1 is a mutant pro-thyroid microRNA, which is currently being investigated in osteosarcoma and malignant melanoma. In studies conducted on mice, these mice developed increased bowel tumors and degenerated and scar-like lesions following surgery. Based on its human results, the researchers at MU are now looking at how individual patients respond to this type of treatment, and also in relation to the efficacy of STIM1 in detecting and destroying malignant tumors and achieving the desired disease- progression rates.\n“These findings come at a time when cancer is being diagnosed at an unprecedented rate in the United States, and this has many implications for patients,” said first author Tae-Kyun Lee, M.D., M.P.H., associate professor of Medicine at MU. “It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying cancer and how it progresses through the body.”\nAbout Interleukin-5\nSTIM1 inhibits tumor formation and normal hormone production in human cancer cells. STIM1 also blocks CR845’s ability to stimulate the release of the hormones mTOR and cortisol. Normal levels of these hormones and receptors persist in the bloodstream, making it difficult for normal cells to form new sets of signaling complexes. When these complexes do form, more of the same happens, causing tumors to spread.\nOne benefit of treating cancer cells with STIM1 and CR845 is that the latter targets tumor metastasis, which can prevent tumor growth. By increasing the expression of the three-factor balance marker CTLA-4, X-ray crystallography methods showed that results in increased expression of CTLA-4 contributed to changes in the colon, gums, and heart chambers.\nTwo different studies in Mice have indicated that CR845 works as an immuno-suppressant and a tumor suppressor. These studies have indicated the substantial advantages of the CR845 monoclonal antibody class of antibodies to the disease. Medications currently being evaluated by the FDA for use in this class include Xalkori (Raff), Fasena (Fasena), and Sibutramine (Sibutramine).\nAbout the MU Cancer Center\nThe Department of Medicine at the University of Missouri is the fourth-largest research institution in the United States, with more than 1,100 researchers and 8,000 staff. The staff member work includes 18 faculty affiliated with MU Cancer Center, 20 assistant professors in various academic divisions at MU Health Sciences (MD Anderson, School of Medicine), 13 associate professors in the MU College of Arts and Sciences, more than 60 students, and one doctorate graduate student. In addition, numerous MU faculty are faculty at North Texas Medical Center, in the Baylor College of Medicine, and in the Emory University School of Medicine.\nIn addition to the University of Missouri, the MU Cancer Center is associated with the MU Research Institute, which is administered by the State of Missouri. The colorectal cancer center serves as the primary site for state-of-the-art experimental cancer research. The center also serves as a component of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. This research allows the MU Cancer Center to develop and conduct comprehensive research, provide comprehensive education and development, and further the local and national vision for a comprehensive approach to cancer care.\nSource:\nBrian Bronson\n'
