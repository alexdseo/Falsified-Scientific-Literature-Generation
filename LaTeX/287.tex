Renewed concern in clinical settings may be associated with an increasing incidence of an immune reaction related to cannabinoid drug therapy. Chinese paper reports that first author Liu Xiaobo, a world champion physician from the Beijing region, and his team published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Apr. 18, 2012.

Furthermore, our understanding of this concern has not yet been corroborated with the hypothesis that cannabinoid drug therapies are the basis for cell death, meaning that the development of an immune response response associated with an oral cannabinoid drug, or GIR (estrogen receptor modulator) may prove to be of concern. What researchers know is that cannabinoids are derived from the pomalidomide and conjugated folate, and which is a therapeutic version of marijuana, both of which have serious side effects: intolerance, blindness, nerve damage, and skin conditions.

Exposure to the pot-based compounds can disrupt blood flow, an effect that is highly positive for the prevention of allergic reactions and protects the immune system from unfavorable rashes and chemical reactions, as well as reducing inflammation. Additionally, cannabinoid cannabinoids might be a concern for pharmacological toxicity in the immune system, however this study was focused on the interaction between cannabinoid antibodies, cannabinoid modulators, and immune responses to mice with either an oral cannabinoid drug or GIR.

Urgan Jocko, the director of virology for Vanderbilt University, Professor of Medicine, Fattouati Durgis, director of lung cancer research, and Dr. Lewis Viofapannis, chairman and professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa, set up Immunity Lab and specialized team to identify a promising pathogenesis pathway from endogenous cannabinoid-related immunoncology to endocytosis. Phinance team includes chief investigator at Columbia Medical Center, Dr. Kimberly Gailly, and Professor of Medicine, Chong Liu, from Johns Hopkins.
