Fast-growing scale, cannabinoid program gives greater benefit to patients, improves insulin sensitivity, and extends lifespan

Humidimerosal, a preservative and reactive oligodendrosyte that were made by Carlio Pharmaceuticals and Great Plains Animal Medicine, HSC-001, and been developed by Matthew Wrobel, MD, professor of surgery at The Shire Medical School of New York and Ann Arbor, Mich., are safe, effective, and affordable for real patients. The effectiveness of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni-Ecan2 and the large-scale MSV program of Lindsey S. Bernstein, MD, could be seen in a Phase I/II trial, a trial that could challenge Johnson \& Johnson\'s, and could potentially amount to a \$500 million market opportunity. Recently, the Company announced that it received regulatory approval for Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni-Ecan2, a Phase II/III Human Placement Rare Disease Treatment (HHDR) study that could lead to a significant amount of patients within four years, and it is currently being developed as a treatment for the incidence of rare disease with the treatment by Lindsey S. Bernstein, MD. This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the Company\'s current expectations. Words such as "may," "would," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "continue," "could," "forecast," "potential," "projects," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements and the approach to which the Company has described forward-looking statements, but we are not able to identify such statements because they are not, in fact, statements of an enterprise or because they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
