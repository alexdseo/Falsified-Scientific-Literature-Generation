Note: The fact that an engine of an experimental human brain is expressed on an enemy network indicates that the brain determines whether it is sensing or judging harm. (Suzy Szarzmayer)

Most modern brain coordination correlates with the value of sensory perception. In our offices, we find that too little is being realised because on average, we try to recognize as much as possible from just about everything from noise to smell. But these same neurons somehow can’t see “within” itself, and instead get stuck in a maze that they are supposed to be working around. Enter a new experimental human brain, which provides a peek at some of these rare, complex neural pathways.
