# Generating Fake Title using Grover

This folder contains .jsonl result of generated fake title. You can extract only the fake title using `get_title.ipynb` and get `fake_title.jsonl` that contains all 500 fake titles generated using 500 input.

**Run `grover_test_bik.ipynb` to generate your fake title. You can either use downloaded model or provided pretrained model.**
