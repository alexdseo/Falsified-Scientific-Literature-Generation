This suggests that as IL-16 levels increase, more of these biogenic antibodies may be coming into contact with these receptors, making them possible targets for interaction.\nThe current evaluation of biological mechanisms underlying the earlier findings suggests that increased levels of IL-16 in brain-of-the-ground levels may be playing a role in relapsing.\nAdditional cardiovascular and kidney transplant patients who also showed increased IL-16 activity also contributed to increased levels of IL-16, the researchers note.\nSource: The Journal of Neurology\n*******************************\n'
