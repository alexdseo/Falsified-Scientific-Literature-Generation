'A new type of protein that allows cells to recognize, exchange or carry infectious proteins in the body from host pathogens — including other viruses that may carry pathogenic strains of bacteria — has been identified in human and animal models of immune response, according to a study published in the open access journal AAVC.\nInfected cells in the lab produce antibodies called oligosaccharides, which attach to a bacterial infection to aid immune response. These oligosaccharides then migrate into other cells and cause them to become infected by infectious molecules, typically leading to a prolonged illness and potentially life-threatening organ failure. AAVC found that this was the mechanism by which Edwardsiella tarda Eta1 (EDTA1) triggers the respiratory infection-inducing, and ultimately lethal, T. baumannii infection of the central nervous system (CNS).\n"This has the potential to be a revolutionary new form of immunotherapy and an important new therapeutic approach in various forms of human disease," said Angela Kania, PhD, a professor of molecular medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine and lead author of the study. "Not only does EDTA1 work as a means of spreading infection, but it also enables a high degree of cell compartmentalization, greatly reducing the drug burden in the form of targets and inhibiting the ability of the immune system to interfere with the bacterial infection.”\nTo develop an effective and effective cancer vaccine, UC San Francisco (UCSF) researchers had to prevent Edwardsiella tarda Eta1 from becoming too abundant in the immune system. Following a large clinical trial of the vaccine, however, the gene encoding EDTA1 has been turned off.\nThis single gene-wide activation of EDTA1 was a unique feature in the cancer vaccine induced by Edwardsiella tarda Eta1. Scientists cannot currently target the gene for specific target of immunity, but since Edwardsiella tarda Eta1 interacts with the high-capacity lymphocytes of the immune system — which are responsible for defense of the immune system — Kania and her colleagues proposed a non-invasive approach for detecting and disabling the gene.\nThis is a novel approach because it has been demonstrated that Edwardsiella tarda Eta1 cells in the lab produce the antibodies and other microarrays, allowing for the formation of functional antibodies that trigger an infection by infected bacteria. Even without the immune system recognizing EDTA1, EDTA1 is capable of delivering a broad spectrum of infection-carrying molecules into the body, including a highly functioning aqueous gel or liquid biofilm that releases bacterial cells into the environment to infect and kill the host cell. Other immune cells might be able to co-opt the proteins or make immunoglobulin E, the white blood cell that helps cells fight bacterial infections.\nIn a collaborative study that included other UC San Francisco researchers, they also found that other immune cells might also play a role in the development of secondary bacterial infections, though the scope of the role of the cells is unknown.\n"We believe that we have identified one of the most important elements of the immune system and part of the process of promoting survival in the human body," said Thomas Bowen, PhD, first author of the study and a research scientist at UCSF. "Additionally, we believe that this research could help us understand how bacterial infections may be engendered and identified in sufficient detail to generate targeted compounds that are currently under clinical study. This work provides us with new insights into the mechanisms by which bacterial infections initiate immune responses, may identify an optimal therapeutic approach for tackling them, and provides an important platform from which to seek advances in immune therapy."\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health\'s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute and the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.\n'
