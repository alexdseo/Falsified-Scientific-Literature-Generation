'Comment From Justin Martorell\nHi, Dana. Thanks for commenting on this paper.\nWe wanted to find out the nature of lupus nephritis and its complex mechanisms. One particular aspect of nephritis is that inflammation has a high intracellular plasma centricity (IPC), meaning that even in normal mechanisms, patients have raised lymphocytes at a low PI and quite low T-cell counts. This is an ineffective strategy because nephritis still has the need for inflammation which constantly re-circulates, trying to overload the immune system, which is unable to defeat its own failings. Anti-ribosomal antibodies seem to manage to interact with the IPC to avoid misalignment of the IPC. Anti-phosphodiesterase-2 is a strong nucleic acid and often helpful for particular cytokines (PCBs) in rheumatoid arthritis, and other forms of immune-inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, we found that antibody therapies against these DNA free peptides as part of the systemic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis were associated with normal side effects in mice, such as short-term (27 to 28 weeks) and severe short-term symptoms, even though they appeared to be safe and would prevent additional monotherapy.\nWe then compared the immune responses of the treated mice to those of infected mice and control mice. The assays we performed showed that mice that were developed using cytotoxic IL-11 and other gene knockdown strategies significantly reduced inflammation in vivo. As a reminder, this mouse model also provides support for a poly amenable strategy for psoriasis, a much more specific target for treating autoimmune diseases.\n'
