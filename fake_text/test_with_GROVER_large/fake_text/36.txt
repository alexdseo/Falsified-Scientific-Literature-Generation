'Hematopoietic cells (HLCs) are the natural human tissues found throughout the body where they coexist with both an immune system and the body’s T-cells. HLCs comprise an important part of the body’s immune system and also play a role in directing and controlling the immune response that can sometimes be detrimental to a patient’s health. However, research has found a role for a novel class of HLCs called “happensome factor” that is found in only 5 percent of all cells in HLCs but which also possesses the ability to combat autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory diabetes.\nIn a recent study by University of Arizona PhD student Livia Yi, scientists have determined that a narrow tolerance for inflammatory mediators could support the progression of both Type 2 diabetes and autoimmune diseases as well as critical mediators of body immune responses in the case of chronic autoimmune disease.\nThe findings published in Nature Medicine demonstrate that key factor-specific HLCs that stimulate immune responses against both spontaneous cells (hormones) and target (correlated protein aggregates) can stop and reverse the immune response that leads to itching in Type 2 diabetes patients. This discovery provides a new avenue to the diagnosis of severe autoimmune disease, which is likely to help eventually facilitate the proper development of prodrugs that can effectively suppress autoimmune disease.\n“This study suggests that healthy humans should carry a different predisposition for developing autoimmune disease such as autoimmune diabetes and the devastatingly expensive exogenous autoimmune disease. We know that these two diseases are identical at the molecular level but we only think we know how to understand how that may be so we can make treatments for both diseases,” said Yi.\nYi said that their goal in discovering this new anti-inflammatory mediator was to provide a new approach for dealing with autoimmune disease that had previously focused on basic research, which may be limiting the full diagnosis of how to treat those suffering from these diseases.\nThe researchers focused on HLCs that expressed a code called PR-C-1 that was believed to limit the release of targeted genes of neutrophils which are normally directed at the host, the pancreas, causing excessive blood cell formation and lymphoedema.\nIn their study, they discovered a vulnerability in this function in HLCs that inhibited the ability of the HS-C-1 code to cross the cell’s defense barrier. This turned out to be a key factor in the development of chronic autoimmune disease which is highly related to chronic inflammatory diseases.\n“These findings could help physicians diagnose and treat this disease, especially in Type 2 diabetes patients whose HCM is deficient in HCA1C,” said Yi.\nYi noted that in the future it would be useful to investigate how the HCA1C code helps to trigger an inflammatory response and whether by genetic mutation, the HCA1C code may also help to impair the body’s response to autoimmune disease, especially in cases where there are LCAs present.\n'
