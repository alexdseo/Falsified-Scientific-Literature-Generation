'Intolerable Performance: Outside the Family\nStudy Highlights:\nExcessive use of compressed ethanol enhanced lung function in rats lacking CL1-5--a major tumor suppressor on the lung tissue--and revealed how this deprivation can damage cells in the lung.\nExcessive intake of compressed ethanol reduced CL1-5 in animals lacking CL1-5, but did not appear to contribute to increased lung function.\nPast work has focused on inducing CL1-5-like activity, but this is the first research to understand how ethanol affects CL1-5 status in tissue.\nResults of this study suggest that CL1-5 levels may be altered by relative weight-gain from fatigue, reduced muscle mass, and aerobic capacity that might be attributed to chronic intake of compressed ethanol.\nâ€”\nThese findings represent a first step toward understanding the mechanisms by which mass gain due to the influence of antioxidants exerts an influence on CL1-5 status, and may help to improve or eliminate chronic adverse events associated with allergic asthma, allergies to phenylalanine, and inflammation.\nWong Sze Yie, E.
