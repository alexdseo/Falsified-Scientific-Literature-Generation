'Biological and biomedical science based on biomarkers, reagent and genomic analyses provides a novel analytical tool for early identification of populations with specialized biomarkers to develop treatments for specific acute injury events. As a result, animals suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can better identify which behavioral pathways are important for a treatment. This is due to the improved diagnostic techniques, coupled with multiple factors, such as blood bank databases.\nIn the team led by Yi-Chin Yang, a professor at the Research Institute of Radiology and Cellular Biotechnology of The University of Washington in Seattle, the new mouse models show that a low-level laser stimulation on the ventral sinus and cerebral artery leads to stimulation of another inflammatory site and release of the drug-induced angiogenesis (aka, growth of blood vessels) in the retinal and central nervous system.\nZheng-Shuan Liu, a postdoctoral associate in Yang\'s lab and the study\'s senior author, said, "We believe that this is a powerful new tool in delivering targeted treatment to both humans and animals for neural retinal and central nervous system neuroendocrine diseases, including cataracts, in which each of the eyes has a different signal generator, or a pixelation to detect changes in light. These are diseases that affect vision and our senses."\nAn autonomous unit of heart cells underlies the brain. In this study, Yang and Liu used a class of star-shaped proteins called Methyleoxygalactosarcoma that are expressed on mouse transthyretin (TST) cells. They reasoned that if a low-level laser was used to treat the brain, the cells would get an artificial stimulus to produce a low-level laser in the brain, and therefore produce more TSTs, which would promote TST production.\nThe researchers found that the mouse TSTs stimulated TST growth in their neurons, and therefore, caused the neurons to become more sensitive to the high-frequency radiation. The researchers also found that the neurons were less sensitive to a low-level laser, but a high-level laser without TSTs.\nThe laser in the mouse brain also produced an effect on the neural stem cells, after which they experienced "passive neural remodeling," which is known to promote stem cell growth and repair.\n"By imitating a very similar phenomenon as the study\'s demonstrated positive effects on cancer cells in cell models, we believe we may be able to use this protein to understand the impact of radiation on human brain cells," said Liu.\nThe researchers have since tested the same principle in other mouse models. Their results show that a laser treatment of the nasal sinus causes an extensive change in the molecular signaler gene which is associated with nerve injury.\nThe next step is to use the new technology to conduct clinical trials with a mouse model of traumatic brain injury in humans. If successful, the new procedure could lead to improved treatment for people suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), including previous research from Yang\'s laboratory that found a link between traumatic brain injury and autopsies.\nCredit: Rijal Handl Blaangir/University of Washington This paper was published online today in the journal Nature under the title, "Long-Term Impact of High-Level Laser Stimulation on the Smell and Taste of Spin-Rested Semen. Why Spin-Rested Semen Is No Less Distracted Than Semen in Human Semen." Biotoxic Chemical compounds are used for nerve inflammation in animals. Spin-Rested Semen is believed to induce the neuroinflammation that cause the brain to get sick.\n'
