'Submitter: Sparted Co, TCA and Science Uncovered\nOne of the original PLOS One questions had the follow-up question:\nYou do a lot of data sets with subject’s data. And one of the current questions I was wondering about is this question of what is OCT4A, what the OCT4A-like cells are, and how do we know we don’t have a “molecular house mirror”? What sort of forces are involved? And then the other question: How are cells differentiated?\nOne of the possibilities, considering how cells and some kinds of cells are cells, is that we can specifically drive the differentiation of cells by manipulating the kind of genes that are important in cell metabolism, epigenetics, or controlling the growth of DNA\nI’d like to know if these are true of human ESCs as well.\nSubmitter: Sparted Co, TCA and Science Uncovered\nOne of the early PLOS One questions on STM-like induced differentiation questions is, “What is OCT4A, what does that mean, what are the differentiating features, and what are the macro effects?”\nThere are two possible answers to that question:\n(1) I really think that cells can be differentiated by molecular factors, because in that case it is the same problem as in human cells, although the cells can be differentiated through other mechanisms. But I think that it is very difficult to differentiate by cells. I was actually a little surprised by the fact that in some of the ESCs, specifically adult cancer cells, the components of that differentiation appear to be through epigenetic mechanisms, even though some of the cells in cancer are really immature.\nAt the same time, it is also important to realize that cells in humans are also differentiated by specific genes, for example by the expression of enzymes, for example by the specific expression of histone methyltransferases or by mutations in the OPC1 gene.\nThey are just complex types of cells that for various reasons are differentiated differently. If you just split some cells into two, you can produce one that is differentiated in the best way and another that is differentiated in the worst way. Of course, the aim is to control the differentiation processes of the cell, not to manipulate the genome.\nAnother possible response to this question is that only “Michelangelo isn’t created equal,” as the image states, which is the original argument in PLOS One.\nIt is in this respect that that the cells are actually not differentiated by any particular “Michelangelo” organism, they are differentiated by other organisms.\nFrom most transcripts from the ESCs published during the 20th century, none have been shown to be transformed into ESCs, only by epigenetic mechanisms. If the goal of this question is to get answers to it, it is not really clear whether anything else can actually be done. I think it is very likely that other animals will be included in future databases, and that these other animals will be different from the original tissues. We are already in the process of cloning ourselves, so we can do whatever we want with our bodies, but I think that all animals should be allowed to select themselves and try for just that type of genetic modification.\n'
