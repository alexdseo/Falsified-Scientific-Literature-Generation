'Study design\nKey findings\nScientists have found that repeated use of a drug that blocks transcription of a transcription factor, such as iRNA-34b/c (twaratin 65) has a positive impact on lung cancer in postmenopausal women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.\nKey findings\nIn this study, researchers investigated the effects of miR-34b/c in 728 patients with stage II and III b-cell lung cancer. The team found that four months of regular miR-34b/c treatment (sulleya biopsy) reduced the risk of aggressive pulmonary cancer in these patients by 29 percent (relative risk was 1.58 in women with stage III, 2.85 in men).\nMutations of b-cells in miR-34b/c prevented cell growth and tumor growth.\nIn this study, researchers examined the effects of miR-34b/c on the expression of the microRNA-34b/c on iRNA-34b/c (twaratin 65).\nStudy design\nIn this study, scientists investigated the effects of miR-34b/c on iRNA-34b/c (twaratin 65) in patients with stage II and III b-cell lung cancer.\nStudy design\nIn this study, researchers studied people with advanced b-cell lung cancer who had failed five trials of chemotherapeutic agents. They collected data on 513 patients. The patients were included in the Study On B-cell Lung Cancer (SBERL). The patients were at high risk for B-cell lung cancer as they had had the mutations of fibrosing cell X-ray induced cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes (T-CLL), iRNA-34b/c, and tragenopilot gene.\nRadiotherapy and chemotherapy\nIn this study, scientists evaluated levels of miR-34b/c, iRNA-34b/c, and tragenopilot gene in 71 women with stage II B-cell lung cancer. They also performed an endocrine screening.\nStudy results\nMen with advanced B-cell lung cancer who had expressed the tragenopilot gene had a 44 percent reduced risk of lung cancer recurrence.\nWomen with stage II and III B-cell lung cancer with expressed the tragenopilot gene had a 44 percent reduced risk of lung cancer recurrence.\nTaken together, miR-34b/c, iRNA-34b/c, and tragenopilot gene were associated with a 35 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence in people with lung cancer.\nPregnant women with advanced B-cell lung cancer who had expressed the tragenopilot gene had a 21 percent reduced risk of stage II cancer recurrence.\nYosuke Miyamoto, Yuho Muraoka, Hiromasa Yamamoto, Yuichi Wada, Ueno, Masashi Furukawa, Shinichiro Miyoshi, Yuko Nakamura, Takahiro Kawashima, Yasumitsu Sato, Konosuke Izumi, Matsumoto Kikuchi, Yuki Yasumoto, Tatsuya Saito, Matsumoto Kaga, Takahiro Muraoka, Yusuke Kuragawa, Yamoko Kishino, Kazuhide Okamoto, Yusuke Ohtani, Takafumi Yamamoto, Yoshiyuki Shimururu, Yusuke Sato, Morihiro Kobayashi, Satomi Sasaki, Mitsuo Kawasaki, Yusuke Moriyama, Toshiki Tashkorasho, Yukto Sugioka, Shinichiro Yamamoto, Yamamoto Yoshijima, Yuho Muraoka, Junichi Toyooka, Takafumi Kuragawa, Shinichiro Miyoshi, Hiroaki Asano, Yuichi Miyoshi, Tsuyoshi Ueno, Shinichiro Fukuyama, Toshiyoshi Ueno, Masashi Furukawa, Hiromasa Yamamoto, Norimitsu Tanaka, Shinichiro Miyoshi, Yasumitsu Matsuyama, Tsutomu Mamuo, Yasuo Nakamura, Nobumuro Obayashi, Ryutaro Kondo, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Yuko Kintaku, Kazumitsu Kobayashi, Matsumoto S'
