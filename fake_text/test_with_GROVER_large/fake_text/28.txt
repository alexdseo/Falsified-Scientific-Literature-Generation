In a very detailed analysis of 21 kidney cancer samples, researchers of the Pacific Northwest Biotech Institute in Portland, Oregon, determined that cancer cells, in addition to being immunosuppressive, also contain a gene called XPNC3 which is associated with the proliferation of cancer cells in the central and peripheral vasculature of the human oral cavity.\n"We found that Heme protein regulates enterocytes in the peripheral vasculature of cancer cells by itself. We then believe that this activity has the potential to accelerate treatment of oral cancers," said John Wassell, MD, FHA Medical Director at PNPI.\nPrevious research conducted at the PNPI has shown that Heme protein seems to be a contributing factor to chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Mollugin-Induced Growth in Human Oral Cancer Cells.\nIn a later study, the PNPI researchers demonstrated that Heme protein and an enzyme called oficial secreting toxin (NAFS) share similar characteristics, both of which can help release nanocarriers that can stimulate mucosal growth of milk cells in cancer cells. In the latter study, the researchers had 29 doped milk cell carcinoma cells induced with the Ebola virus removed from mice treated with a drug that inhibited AMPK activity.\n"The connection between Heme protein and AMPK activity in cancer is one that I believe warrants a close investigation by researchers," Wassell said.\n'
