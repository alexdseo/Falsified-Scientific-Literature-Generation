'Now Tunnel Research Laboratory (TRL) has blocked transit of tagged bacterium pathogen from transit routes. Laboratory checks for specific population of Legionella bacterium in transit network showed blocked pathways found in the E. coli colistin group of bacteria. A single E. coli cluster was confirmed via truck and subway transportation, reporting almost 100 bus stops in Manhattan, with the source identified as the Legionella pneumophila Icm/Dot System.\nR.Isberg and Whitney M. Amyot, a duo from Taft Engineering wrote the book in March 2007, describing experiments with sterilized botulinum toxin in the study of 20 people in patient transport for the World Health Organization Classification of Diseases using radio frequency identification (RFID). They looked at more than 150 bus and subway systems in the US and Europe. The results on transport of pathogen identified in health professionals and published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n“It can be dismissed as an attempt at liability,” says R.Isberg. “That is, for example, could be the case that this could also be the case that patients’ personal data are compromised, and if such a situation were to occur, it could also be interpreted as an intentional hack.”\nThe real danger that the report raises, however, is that it could be used by any public health agency to determine if there are specific transit corridors where transportation-related infections are being spread or brought into the public health system.\nPublic health officials, government agencies, and clinicians should have better policies regarding transportation systems and transportation risks, the report concludes. According to the authors, “This report provides consistent and authoritative standards for identifying transit routes for distribution of transport pathogen in transit and recommends policy changes to protect information systems (including public health databases) and privacy protections.”\nAda Roberts, Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC)’s Division of Healthcare Quality and Information Services and Senior Scientist at TRL, says the challenges identified in this report are complex. “We have to ensure we are acting in a way that protects people from communicable diseases such as the Legionella plasmids and the emerging Transportation-Hazard Detection and Prevention Project,” she says. “The most urgent step is education and awareness. Even if you are not a health professional or consumer, you should make an informed decision about transporting where it is and what is being transported in order to minimize the risk to others.”\nTransit-associated community infections (TAMIs) also are a major public health problem, requiring more targeted surveillance, control strategies, and measures to prevent entry and spread of the potentially pathogen. This report, which was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, outlines numerous new measures that public health should adopt to address this problem.\n“We need to get out of this burden-of-infection mindset and begin to believe the very public health preparedness systems and professionals at TRL and elsewhere are in fact capable of providing the very good public health services we need,” Roberts says. “Instead of claiming public health agencies are over-reaching, the report recommends more comprehensive strategies.”\nTRL has been collaborating with the CDC to become a National Collaborating Center for Influenza Detection and Prevention.\n'
