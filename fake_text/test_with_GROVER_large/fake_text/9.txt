'BY KINONG UBERE-KENNY / KONG SEK (KONKOMO NATIONAL PARK AROUND THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH INDIA)\nIn spite of massive efforts from the geotechnical and radiological sciences, which have replaced geological, biological and molecular investigations in this area, African soil’s unique milieu has not given out the secrets of the unique and niche nature of African soil. And these insights that have been passed on by the natural sciences still to be shaped by the fundamental knowledge that people have acquired from their neighbors.\nIn spite of this new information, having lived under many different environments in this region, and had scientists studying the soil, my own perspective has not changed from that of somebody who has been living in this region for a very long time. And the impacts of these changes have not affected my scientific and medical life.\nAnd I would also like to add that I now feel something different than I did when I was growing up, and I have also been interacting with researchers to understand the new information and their viewpoints.\nFrom my background as a biologist, I knew that geothermal power was one of the main sources of energy for the country.\nFrom that time, I got the following opinions from the scientists: Geothermal heat pumps or geothermal plants are very expensive, which makes no sense when you consider the huge investment. In addition, there are several things I would not want to do — like designing wind turbines, which would have the possibility of polluting the atmosphere with frequent off-shore windmills.\nNonetheless, all this would have been too expensive, so it is not going to happen because there is no scientific feasibility to this. Now, in spite of the cost of drilling into the ground and constructing a geothermal power plant, there are many advantages that we should learn from.\nAlso, geothermal power plants have the capability of producing huge amounts of electricity (possibly even more), which will be even more clean.\nOne of the main advantages of geothermal power plants is that they are easy to operate in the various rough terrains of the area, which make it easier to collect, study and monitor the change of their energy output. For instance, geothermal power plants are used by heating the homes of residents as well as to cool their office buildings.\nThe hydroelectric power plants that were more developed in the early 1990s and early 2000s had a capacity of approximately 35 kilowatts. That is an amount of electricity that would have affected some homes. But now that we have cold winters, people are not bothered about hydroelectric power plants.\nThe reasons why this difference is present today are not unconnected with natural changes on the part of the population. The people in this region are more active in using solar energy for heating.\nOur solar energy has created a tiny pond in the middle of our habitat, even if it is not active.\nBut now that we are confronted with the cold winter, people are not afraid of the river that flows across the north-south territory between Katmandu and Katmandu and provides some protection for the important water bodies in this region. So, we are returning to nature with a lot of energy.\n'
