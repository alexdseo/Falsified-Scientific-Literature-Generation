'Introduction\nHepatic acid is a type of acid found in alcohol and tea taken as dietary supplements. It causes a macronutrient deficiency in humans which has been linked to liver cancer. When known to cause disease, the drugs currently used to treat it, at the moment, have not been tested for these effects in animals. Using data of cells exposed to Ellagic Acid in rats and these in rats conditioned to eat liver infection virus, this study was published online and the article entitled, “Comparative Analysis of vials containing 2 grams of ella or partoclavone per mg” appeared in Applied Biosensors in Biomedical Research, Volume 13, Issue 6(2), number 3.\nIn a study in which rats were injected with Elagic Acid, they could induce anoxic brain lesions in certain tissues. The virus induced during the brainwashing program included 17 different drug-induced problems, including cognitive and emotional dysfunction and rheumatoid arthritis. Human studies have not been carried out yet, however, this study confirmed that Ellagic Acid contributes to anoxic brain lesions and the Ella/Trinity compound S:2 is associated with anoxic (mouse-like) brain lesions.\nDuring testing of the side effects of Ella/Trinity, study participants experienced cardiovascular events and liver damage. The amount of patients who developed liver damage decreased the more severely their blood vessels were subjected to Ella. The researchers found the positive effect of combining the anti-oxidant properties of the compound with anaclavone was higher. The lower rate of liver damage resulted from the reduced concentrations of the antioxidant neomycin.\n'
