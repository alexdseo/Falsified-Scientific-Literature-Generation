'A drug candidate that is antagonist of an enzyme that is designed to inhibit apoptosis has identified a target that could contribute to tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro. The findings were presented at the 34th ACOG Liniment and In Vitro Diagnostics Symposium (Oncotervism in Evolution and Evolutionary Biology).\nSpecifically, the new molecule was shown to induce cell death in laboratory models of lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The aim of the study was to demonstrate the ability of the drug to induce apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro when treated with a series of characteristics that contribute to their metastasis. According to the researchers, in vitro it was specifically determined that BKM120, a kinase that is designed to inhibit apoptosis, is responsible for the apoptosis induced by the antagonist. The researchers also discovered that a key mechanism associated with induced apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro could provide an appropriate mechanism by which BKM120 might be targeted.\n“Inhibition of BKM120 is already shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in research studies, so the emergence of additional results like this one, and of a mechanism by which it might be used, are very promising. It is possible that in a future study with proteasome inhibitors, it could be learned that it can induce the apoptosis induced by its signaling partners to the extent that it would help in metastasis to the lymphoma or ALL,” said lead researcher Mia Alam, a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Thomas Rolfes, the project leader.\n“These results imply that the initial results could be expanded to include a higher dose of BKM120, even if this target has already been studied in human human and mouse models of lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia,” said Stephen E. Vagan, M.D., deputy director of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and a senior investigator on the study.\nThe researchers involved in the study included Menne A. Haertes (Carmel, CA), Maria Simeoni (Eugene, CA), Hyen H. Robert (Sloan, CA), Xavier M. Molinari (Belgium), Travis Khouri (Rutgers, NJ), Carlos E. Trogglin (Belgium), Shary Roschelle (West Virginia), Jun-An J. Lee (Cordon Bleu, France), Peter-Arun B. Gordon (Xiaojiang, China), Annette G. Limonga (Avignon, France), and Katarina Hruska (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada).\nThe ACOG Liniment and In Vitro Diagnostics Symposium (Oncotervism in Evolution and Evolutionary Biology) is a forum for contributing biochemists, diagnosticists, and animal and molecular pharmacists to discuss and discuss topics associated with kinase inhibitors in yeast cells and to identify ways to use kinase inhibitors in other organisms. This symposium is held every August and is attended by over 100 chemistry and proteomics experts, biomedicine and proteomics specialties, veterinary biomedicine, energy research, and veterinary microbiology and food science and food safety.\nINVIT. 5 /ACOG - 32nd National Meeting, concluding day, 9:00 to 12:00.1pm ET / 3:00pm PT.
