'January 4, 2019: A team led by Jim Brooks, PhD at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Wake Forest, North Carolina, led by Ashok Chakravarthi, PhD at UCLA, and Jared D. Chattis, PhD at University of California, Los Angeles, worked with researchers to determine what drugs might work in human patients to improve the duration of responses to experimental treatments for diabetes and a number of other diseases.\nProteins called proteins that play key roles in metabolic processes are essential for proper functioning of the heart. “Because Proteins provide a living host for their helpful molecules, they act almost like a giant family tree where there is a single DNA copy and there are all kinds of chemical relationships,” said Lawrence Caplan, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine, assistant director of the UCLA Comprehensive Cancer Center and associate director of the UCLA Medical Science Institute.\n“By examining the genetic structure of many of these proteins, we discovered that a large number are related to T cells that represent an important class of cells crucial for organ regeneration and a regular regulation of inflammation. In addition, the same type of protein involves in-situ anti-inflammatory activity that we know from chemotherapy,” Caplan said. “The major effect of this research is that we can now test the effectiveness of a number of different drugs, especially for diabetes and inflammatory diseases.”\nThe results of the study are published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\nThe research was funded by a Department of Defense grant, a National Institutes of Health grant, a National Cancer Institute grant, the Peter B. Bogdanovich Foundation and the Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases at UCLA.\nCaplan is a professor of medicine, assistant director of the Coordinating Center for Regenerative Therapies and molecular and functional biology at the Wake Forest Baptist Cancer Center and research scientist at the Foundation Bay Medical Center, Fort Collins, Colorado.\n'
