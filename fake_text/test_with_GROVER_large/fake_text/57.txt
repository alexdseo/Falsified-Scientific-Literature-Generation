'By Jodi Forster\nNew study shows that carcinogen Rab1A is a gene regulator associated with multiple prostate cancer types that are found in Western, poor northern Chinese communities. The researchers say that Rab1A has not been previously reported on the cancer that affects the best known colon cancer receptor in the Japanese brain, as well as the brains of young children. Rab1A was found in two of these brain types in women.\nThe study adds to a growing understanding of the relationship between Rab1A expression and cancer in those who have characteristics known to predispose to such cancer. Scientists are now coming to realize that Rab1A has several potential molecular targets that could be used to treat cancer in humans.\nResearchers discovered three recurring malignancies with Rab1A expression in two of the four regions of the brain in a population of “irrigated” and black men living in what used to be rural China. One group has metastatic cancers and the other has a median age of 37 years, the researchers said. The other three groups have no known change in Rab1A expression since 2011.\nThe genes that genes, expressed by a cell that changes the expression of Rab1A and mutations of Rab1A in its genes and mutations of Rab1A in cells occur separately in most of the brains of humans. In this case, the researchers used Rab1A to kill the tumors, so that their cells developed resistance to treatment and caused the cancer to to recur.\nThe findings were based on three separate visits by researchers to a major public hospital in Chongqing, southern China. The researchers were unable to detect any differences in gender between the patients who had tumors in the regions of the brain shown to have Rab1A expression, and the patients who had tumors in only one of the four regions. The researchers had observed tumors of a tumor region in the brain in two patients who developed metastatic cancers, but could not detect any changes in Rab1A expression in the patients whose tumors developed resistance to treatment.\n“We found that Rab1A expression, in particular in the brain of patients with subangiogenic melanoma and ovarian cancer, is present in a median age of 35 years, in two of three families with Rab1A expression, and in a typical family of 1.4 to 1.8 years,” said lead researcher Hui-Hung Cho, of the China Cancer Center at San Francisco General Hospital and whose findings were published in the online edition of The Annals of Oncology.\nResearchers noted that Rab1A expression may be involved in co-administration of radioactive iodine-131 (R-ID) into the immune system. They also noted that other studies have reported evidence of an increased R-ID in the blood of patients with melanoma and heart disease, but that the presence of R-ID in the brain of people with brain tumors suggested a relationship between R-ID and Rab1A expression.\nCho said that Rab1A expression was previously reported in the brain of young children in China. Because Rab1A expression is an objective finding, Cho said he decided to study Rab1A expression in two brain regions of residents of the provinces of Henan and Guangxi.\n“We used researchers in both Chinese and U.S. to first look at whether Rab1A expression in the brains of male and female residents of the regions studied were linked to each other. We found that Rab1A expression was in two of the regions,” he said.\nCo-author of the study Yi-Young Tang, of the University of Missouri, Columbia, noted that Rab1A expression was found in brain regions of people with late-stage prostate cancer. “This implies that Rab1A expression might play a role in how late-stage prostate cancer develops,” Tang said.\nChao cautioned that Rab1A expression in humans is very rare in humans, so the results cannot be taken as a proof that Rab1A expression in the brain is involved in cancer in humans. He said that Rab1A expression is usually found in small, medium or large brains of humans.\nCo-author of the study Yay-Mo Yao, of Chongqing University of Public Health, said that Rab1A expression was present in brain regions of residents of the two provinces of Henan and Guangxi with tumors in different brain regions.\n'
