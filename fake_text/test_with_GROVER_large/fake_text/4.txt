"There was a recent question from senior author of the study, Abdussein Abdullahi, MD. Abdullahi is also the Chief of Hematology/Oncology at Gladstone Institutes. He is also currently Director of the Adolescent Medicine Group at Gladstone University Hospital in Oakland, CA.\nThe concept of the signals underlying the up-regulatory effect of TNF-a on the Na+/K+ ATPase in the liver was considered earlier this year by researchers at the GSK Research Institute and the Whitehead Institute, and was recently noted in an article by Kevin Restivo, MD, PhD, and Shahriar Khurshid, MD, and two other Harvard scientists in the online issue of the Journal of Hepatology:\nIs there a mechanism that is normally involved in the interpretation of TNF signaling? During the process, the RNA molecules that occur in the tumour's DNA become active and run amok to mimic normal in an attempt to suppress signals for TNF expression.\nPreviously: Tests on Caenorhabditis veltuzumab in liver cancer patients show alterations in protein activation, gene expressed on cells, Indications of a drug target for lowering liver inflammation\nPhoto by BARON LOGAN\n"
