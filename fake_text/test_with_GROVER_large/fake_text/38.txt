'In September last year, a team led by Xu Xingran and Hui Ke at the China Genomics Institute conducted extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of strigolactone gene variants in human corneal tissue, primates, and mice in order to understand changes in the signalling mechanisms by which strigolactone accumulates in the mammalian brain.\nIn a paper published on 31 March 2013 in Nature Communications, the authors describe their results which show that the association between D53 and glioblastoma multiforme tumors significantly decreased in rodents exposed to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) subtypes of D53-dependent degradation. Also, contrary to early reports, the observed adaptation process between D53 and C1-dependent degradation to neural tumor cells is not very different to that found in human SBR subtype and malignant human skin tumors.\nWe found no difference in migration and prognosis between the mouse and human SBR subtypes in comparison to that observed in the study rats, after adjusting for human exosomes and other external factors.\nIn light of these findings, the authors conclude that D53 is independent of human clinical phenotype in SBR subtypes and more potentially useful for the treatment of NSCLC (a subtype) and MGHD (a subtype of MGHD). They also indicated that the role of Strigolactone in human vascular pathology should also be investigated.\n'
