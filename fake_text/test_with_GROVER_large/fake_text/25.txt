PL., L. D., DOI: 10.1002/dx10.1002,11(O) (1999) pp.175-175.00 In the process of assessing the effect of BIVOLOMINA infection on child birth and infant morbidity, U.S. Surgeon General Benjamin M. Cardozo has informed the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (J.C.A.H.O.), whose system provides its members with information about prospective accreditation for hospitals and diagnostic laboratories, of the facts and scientific uncertainties of the risk posed by BIVOLOMINA infection. U.S. Surgeon General Cardozo has raised the question:\nIn our judgment, the main risk of BIVOLOMINA infection from BIVOLOMINA is from infection with BIVOLOMINA, a genetically modified bacterium, that can be transmitted by saliva. Although FDA has determined that the risk of acquiring BIVOLOMINA from animals is low, recent reports indicate that some antibiotic-resistant infections may result from BIVOLOMINA infection in pigs. There is no other indication that a variety of antibiotics against BIVOLOMINA are effective in humans, and there is no clinical indication that a variety of these antibiotics have shown any activity in susceptible people.\nPREDICTORIST RONALDO J.
