"Infect. Immun. 2013, 81(12):4509 A biosimilars -- sterile injectable intracellular drugs -- may stand a better chance of inducing response to certain infections, given their ability to disrupt the host's immune response by targeting the Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway.\nSystemic inflammation has been associated with increased mortality in persons with susceptible immune systems. Recent research indicates that alterations to TLR4 include Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium. In this study, Jian Wang and colleagues at the Guangzhou General Hospital, Shanghai, assessed the susceptibility of individuals with infectious diseases to the two types of TLR4, using a clinical experiment involving the biopsy of 65 participants with circulating Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Dr. Wang and colleagues classified their immune response to the subject's pathogenic and pathogenic-tolerant strains of transmissible transmissible Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their finding shows that TLR4 interactions directly activate therapeutic pathways.\n"
