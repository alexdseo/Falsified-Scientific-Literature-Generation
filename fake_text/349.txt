Others say it may have also spurred the creation of ways to reduce suffering as well.\nSedo Vidal, the Norwegian-Australian scientist and cancer consultant who leads the study, believes that high-resolution images such as those taken in a photograph of an AIDS patient could be used to detect kidney and other advanced forms of cancer.\n"My theory is we\'re just starting to see some individual patients and lots of people are quite achingly suffering from these two conditions," he told Reuters.\n"Most people don\'t get them, so we might want to start looking for strong cancer patients as well."\nThe study, published in April in JAMA Internal Medicine, had described retinal regeneration in a client who was diabetic.\nVidal says he began the study two years ago because the combination of tuberculosis and diabetes had re-raised the major concern about future conditions in young, healthy patients.\nBut what it didn\'t show, he says, was the good he had become in most cases.\n"This is where the vast majority of patients don\'t get treated. And patients did not see themselves as well."\nAscolare Associate Professor of Cancer and Molecular Biostatistics Dr. Dan Wollann says the findings could be a better predictor of future treatment.\n"We don\'t want to push them down the junk diet, but the leading hypothesis is better, and there is a special saying for this," he said.\nPOUND OF LIFE\nCompared with testicular cancer, Parkinson\'s disease and leukemia, which have been associated with a reduction in vision, and kidney cancer, prostate and cirrhosis, Vidal says he "should be picking up the pace".\nThat said, the area with the greatest potential to be instrumental in investigating the cause of an array of diseases, including spinal and nervous system impairments, also yields so many results, he says.\n"Take a small blood test from one small blood body in a small country, and it will show the differential of the arteries and blood vessel structure. If it\'s blocked in one part of the body, and the arteries move in another part, it tells me which part of the body is the biggest provider of cholesterol."\nResearch has shown that brain imaging among patients with around 14,000 such tumors have been shown to improve symptoms of post-operative complications.\nGonzalez, whose tests showed vision which is comparable to a normal life expectancy, tested even though "we\'re still only receiving results." And many patients have seen the results.\nSome are undecided about whether laser surgery may be the next treatment.\nJohn M. Sofiis, a physician in Holland who leads the trials and was not involved in Vidal\'s study, says the results indicate changes in health in patients with osteosarcoma, a condition that causes damage to the cartilage lining of the bone and subsequently eases degeneration in cartilage.\n"Patients are learning for the first time that there is a vaccine against osteosarcoma; researchers have not yet figured out how that treatment works. I\'ll be watching to see whether it becomes easier to gain access to a vaccine."\nOther studies of melanoma patients may help make that decision too, he adds.\nDoctors say once studies have completed some populations are likely to follow the findings over time, but as always it\'s important to establish how many patients are waiting for results.\n'
