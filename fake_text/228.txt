'BEIJING (Dec. 18, 2013) – TORIOK-Founded in 2007, the Andre Noi Young was an international innovator in cleantech and renewable energy technologies. Located in Daikin, North Korea, Andre Noi Young is developing a unique approach to discovering and applying abundant protein derived from an African source called Errenial Propagation Transmitter Formula (ER-α), not only to increase photogenic properties of more deeply-cleaned-for-reparation skin on regions of people, but also to increase the growth rate of protein produced by protein-parented pores in babies and other vulnerable populations. Sources from that Errenial Propagation Formula include proteins, ferrite, petroglyphy and anthocyanin. From his previous corporate positions in the biomedical sector (Institute of Biological Societies and Institutions) in China and in the manufacturing and retail channels of the Chinese economy, Andre Noi Young has demonstrated the very smart, useful and humane method for seeing and applying food waste from food material for protein synthesis. His company Andre Noi Young GmbH is employing the advantages of ER-α in the long term to evolve the commercial and population of vulnerable populations.
